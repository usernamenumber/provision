1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,090
I've talked a lot about the
general idea that in order to

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,010
have a state variable like,
say, U, which is internal

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,440
energy, at any point in this
PV diagram, that state

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,710
variable should be that value.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,660
So for example, if at this
point, U is equal to 5, and I

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,630
go do this whole Carnot cycle,
when I come back to state A, U

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,630
should still be equal to 5.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,990
It should not have changed.

10
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,770
It's not dependent upon what
we did to get there.

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,530
So if we did some kind of crazy
path on our PV diagram,

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,990
we got back there, U should
always be the same.

13
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,760
That's what it means to
be a state variable.

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,000
It's only dependent upon its
position in this PV diagram.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,960
It's only dependent on its
state, not how you got there.

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,850
And because of that, heat is
something that we can't really

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,110
use as a state variable.

18
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,100
For example, if I tried to
define some heat-related state

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,980
variable, let's say I call it
heat content, and I defined

20
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,230
change in heat content as equal
to the amount of heat

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,160
added to the system.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,470
Well, if we go back to our
Carnot cycle here, let's say

23
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,850
that my heat content
here was 10.

24
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,510
Well, I added some heat here,
in this process here.

25
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,470
Nothing happened, because this
was adiabatic from B to C.

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,030
Then from C to D, I took
out some heat.

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,990
But I took out less heated
than was added here.

28
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,140
And then here, nothing was
done with regard to heat.

29
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,780
So I did add some heat
to the system.

30
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,500
The net heat that I added to
the system as I went around

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,610
the cycle-- in this case, Q
would be equal to Q1 minus Q2.

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,930
And we know that this number
is larger than this.

33
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,730
The net amount of heat we added
to the system was the

34
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,740
amount of work we did on the
system, because the internal

35
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,260
energy didn't change.

36
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:50,540
So if this is 0, then the amount
of heat we add to the

37
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,480
system is the amount
of work we did.

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,520
Our internal energy is
definitely 0 as we go all the

39
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,680
way around.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,710
We did this shaded portion of
work-- I showed you that

41
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,850
several videos ago, that the
area inside of our little

42
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,570
cycle is the amount
of work we did.

43
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,390
And so that's also the
net amount of heat

44
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,960
added to the system.

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,720
So if we added that amount of
heat to the system, if we

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,680
started off at the heat of 10
here, or whatever my heat

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,870
content mystical variable I made
up just now, when we go

48
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,705
around, it would then
be 10 plus W.

49
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,500
If we go around again,
it would be 10 plus

50
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,990
2W and 10 plus 3W.

51
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,370
So it can't be a legitimate
state variable, because it's

52
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,330
completely dependent on what
we did to get there.

53
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,350
And if we keep going around the
cycle, we can increase it,

54
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,350
even though we get to
the same point.

55
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,740
So this is an illegitimate state
variable, where I define

56
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,310
the change in our little made up
heat content to be equal to

57
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,460
the heat added to system.

58
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,280
Not a valid state variable.

59
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,750
Ignore it all.

60
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,030
Now we know that Q1, we added
more heat here than we took

61
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,680
away, so there was something
net heat added.

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,930
But there's something
interesting here.

63
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,980
We added it at a higher
temperature.

64
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,660
And here we took less heat away
at a lower temperature.

65
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,340
So maybe we can define another
state variable that can have

66
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,230
the result that when we go
around the cycle, we do get

67
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,085
back to our same value.

68
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:10,620
Now let me just-- we're
just experimenting.

69
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,410
Although I know where this
experiment will go.

70
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,540
I wouldn't have been doing
it if I didn't.

71
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,900
So let's say I define a
new state variable S.

72
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,460
And I define a change in S.

73
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,330
So I say, a change in S-- I'm
just making up a definition--

74
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,140
is equal to the heat added to
the system divided by the

75
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,310
temperature at which it was
added to the system.

76
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,140
Now, I don't know what
this means just yet.

77
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,160
In future videos, maybe we'll
get intuition about what this

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,140
actually means in kind
of our minds.

79
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,730
But let's see if at least this
is a valid state variable.

80
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,980
If, as we go around the Carnot
cycle, whether our change in

81
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,230
delta S is 0, right?

82
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,430
To be a legitimate state
variable, we have some value

83
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,130
for S here.

84
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,160
Maybe it's 100.

85
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,520
I don't know.

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,920
Once we go back around the
Carnot cycle, it should be 100

87
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,290
again, or our delta
S should be 0.

88
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,000
So what's the delta S?

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,580
So the delta S, as we go around
the whole cycle-- let

90
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,860
me write delta S-- let
me do another color.

91
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,400
Delta S.

92
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,935
As we are go around, I'll say
c for the Carnot cycle.

93
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:19,220
As we go around the Carnot
cycle, is going to be equal

94
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,190
to-- well, when we went from A
to B, we were at a constant

95
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,410
temperature, and we added Q1.

96
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,230
So it's Q1, and we were
at temperature T1.

97
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,330
Fair enough.

98
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,150
Then when we went from B
to C, it was adiabatic.

99
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,860
We added or took away no heat.

100
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,580
So this value, Q over
T, would just be 0.

101
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,780
So it's plus 0.

102
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,420
Then we went from C to D.

103
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,000
We were at a new temperature,
we were on a new isotherm.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
We were at T2.

105
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,490
And we took away, or I won't put
the sign here, let's just

106
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,150
say we added Q2 heat.

107
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,240
We're going to actually
solve for it later.

108
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,300
We added Q2 heat.

109
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,260
We'lll see that it's actually
a negative value.

110
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,000
And then finally, when we
went from D to A, it

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,170
was adiabatic again.

112
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,150
So no transfer of heat.

113
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,730
So plus 0, right?

114
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,730
The 0's are 0's over, you know,
changing temperature,

115
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,270
but this is just 0.

116
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,460
So this thing should be equal to
0 in order for this to be a

117
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,260
valid state variable.

118
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,510
So let's figure out what
this value is.

119
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,230
What Q1-- so our change in our
mystical new candidate state

120
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,810
variable, S, as we go around the
Carnot cycle, is equal to

121
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,240
Q1 over T1, plus Q2 over T2.

122
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,770
And we'll see, Q2 is negative.

123
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,770
So what is Q1?

124
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,890
Can we calculate Q1?

125
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,200
Well, as we're on this top
isotherm, our temperature

126
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,080
doesn't change, our internal
energy doesn't change.

127
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,060
So if your internal energy
does not change, if your

128
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,820
internal energy is 0, then the
heat added to the system is

129
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,670
equal to the work done
by the system.

130
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,300
So its the area under
this curve.

131
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,810
   

132
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,240
Not just the area
in the cycle.

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,570
It would be the whole area
under the curve.

134
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,280
So what's the whole area
under the curve?

135
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,930
Well, so let me do a
little aside here.

136
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:20,240
So Q1 is equal to the work done
as we went from A to B.

137
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,500
And work, remember, can just be
written as pressure times

138
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,820
change in volume.

139
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,710
We're going to do a little
calculus here, so I'll write

140
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,605
dV for a small change
in volume.

141
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,295
   

142
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:35,130
And we're going to integrate
it all over the

143
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,230
little sums, right?

144
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,220
This dV is this little
change in volume

145
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,380
right there times pressure.

146
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,710
That makes a little rectangle.

147
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:49,110
And then we sum up all the
rectangles from our initial

148
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:56,000
volume, which is VA, to our
final volume, which is VB.

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,780
And then, what's Q2 going
to be equal to?

150
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,210
Well, Q2 is going to be
essentially the same thing.

151
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,540
It's going to be the sum of the
work done by our system,

152
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,880
which in this case is going to
be negative, because work was

153
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,090
done to our system as we
go from here to here.

154
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,430
Right?

155
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,640
That's when Q2 was operating,
the heat was being taken out

156
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,560
of the system.

157
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,770
So we're going to go from--
where was our starting point?

158
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,250
VC and we go to VD.

159
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,550
Now, how can we evaluate
these integrals?

160
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,050
Well, we've done this before
in a previous video.

161
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,250
We use both of these
circumstances-- When we go to

162
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,140
A to B, and we go from C
to D-- both of these

163
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,470
circumstances occur on
isotherms, right?

164
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,000
So the only things that
are changing are

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,060
pressure and volume.

166
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,210
Temperature is not changing.

167
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:55,510
And so if we go back to our
ideal gas equation-- PV is

168
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,110
equal to nRT-- we can just
rewrite this by dividing both

169
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:06,940
sides by V, as P is equal
to nRT over V.

170
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,620
And substitute that back in
for P, in both cases.

171
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,410
That is P as a function of V.

172
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,740
We now have the equation
of the curve.

173
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,630
And we're taking the area
under it in both cases.

174
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:24,620
So Q1 is equal to the integral
from VA to VB

175
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,120
of nRT over V, dv.

176
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:40,210
And Q2 is equal to the integral
from VC to VD of nRT

177
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:46,190
over V, dv I'm going to do two
integrals in parallel, just so

178
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,280
that you kind of see that we're
essentially solving the

179
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,640
same thing.

180
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,040
OK.

181
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,900
So how can we solve this?

182
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,520
Well, we know in both of
these cases, we're

183
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,910
moving along an isotherm.

184
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,320
That our temperatures
are constant.

185
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,470
And actually, we know the
temperatures are.

186
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,820
When we're moving from VA to
VB, our temperature is T1.

187
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,140
It was kept that way
by our reservoir.

188
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,340
When we moved from VC to VD,
our temperature was T2.

189
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,330
It was kept that way by
our reservoir, right?

190
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,280
T2, when we move from C to D.

191
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,830
And T1, we move from A to B
Those were our temperatures.

192
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,570
And they're constant.

193
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,340
Fair enough.

194
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,320
So we can take-- so
n is constant.

195
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,380
R is definitely a constant.

196
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,810
n is just a number of molecules
we have. And then

197
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,520
our temperature is also
constant, so we can take it

198
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,890
out of the integral.

199
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:37,640
So we can rewrite Q1 is equal to
nRT1 over the integral from

200
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:49,430
VA to VB times 1/V dv, and Q2 we
can write as nRT2 times the

201
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:56,000
integral from VC
to VD, 1/V dv.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,560
All right.

203
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,900
Now this integral is fairly
straightforward to evaluate.

204
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,660
The antiderivative of 1/V
is the natural log of V.

205
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:11,470
So we get Q1 is equal to nRT1
times the natural log of V

206
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,050
evaluated at VB, minus
it evaluated at VA.

207
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,650
And Q2-- well, let me just
solve this whole equation

208
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,580
right here.

209
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,320
So this is equal to what?

210
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,710
This is equal to a natural
log of VB minus the

211
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,160
natural log of VA.

212
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,390
Which is the same thing as the
natural log of VB over VA

213
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,590
times nRT1.

214
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,850
And all that is equal to Q2.

215
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,690
Now, the same logic, Q2, is
going to be equal to what?

216
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,220
Q2 is going to be
equal to nRT2.

217
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,090
Now the only difference with
this integral is where I had

218
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,440
VB, now I have VD.

219
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,960
Sorry.

220
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,790
So then it becomes natural
log of VD.

221
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,300
And where I had VA, now
I have VC, So over VC.

222
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,290
All right.

223
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,870
Now what was our original
question that we

224
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,730
were dealing with?

225
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,020
We said, this is a legitimate
state variable.

226
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,510
If the change in this-- whatever
this value S as we go

227
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,350
around the cycle-- is
equal to 0, that

228
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,690
means it didn't change.

229
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,400
So these two things, when you
sum them, have to equal 0.

230
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,800
Q1 over T1, plus Q2 over T2.

231
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,860
So let's add them.

232
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:29,820
So Q1 over T1 is equal
to that over T1.

233
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,150
That cancels out.

234
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,110
Q2 over T2 is equal
to that over T2.

235
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,730
That cancels out.

236
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,360
So our change in our mystical
state variable, as we go

237
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,340
around the Carnot cycle,
is equal to Q1 over T1,

238
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,730
plus Q2 over T2.

239
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:56,770
Which is equal to nR times the
natural log of VB over VA.

240
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,760
That's that, right there.

241
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:06,070
And then plus Q2 over T2, which
is just nR times the

242
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:15,120
natural log of VD over V.

243
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,310
This is VC.

244
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,460
This is a VA here.

245
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,360
All right.

246
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,140
Now let's see what we can do.

247
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,570
This is equal to--
almost there.

248
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,720
Home stretch.

249
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,820
nR.

250
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,930
We can factor out an nR.

251
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,130
And then the natural log of A
plus the natural log of B is

252
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,080
just the same thing as the
natural log of AB.

253
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:40,590
So this is equal to times the
natural log of VB over VA,

254
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,620
times VD over VC.

255
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,440
All right.

256
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,280
So this is our change in our
S, state verbal that we're

257
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,660
playing with right now.

258
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,910
Now what is this equal to?

259
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:59,890
   

260
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,030
Let me think of the best
way to say this.

261
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,030
So let's divide the numerator
and the denominator by VC.

262
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,420
So let me take this expression
here, and divide its numerator

263
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,590
and its denominator,
essentially, by VC over VD.

264
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,260
Or let me multiply
its numerator and

265
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,720
denominator VC over VD.

266
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,260
So I can rewrite this as the
natural log of VB over VA,

267
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,000
divided by-- right?

268
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,330
Instead of multiplying it times
this, I can divide it by

269
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,500
this reciprocal, VC over VD.

270
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,960
   

271
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,980
So I just rewrote it.

272
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,030
I just did a little bit
of fraction math.

273
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,590
That's all it is.

274
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,690
Instead of multiplying it times
this, I divided by its

275
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,030
reciprocal.

276
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,530
Now you see why the previous
video I did was done.

277
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,610
What is this equal to?

278
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,230
On the previous video, I showed
you that VB over VA is

279
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,340
equal to VC over VD.

280
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,630
We did that big convoluted hairy
proof to prove this.

281
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,190
And now that we proved it, we
can use this to know that this

282
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,270
quantity is equal to
this quantity.

283
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,920
So if you divide something by
itself, they're equal to each

284
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,770
other, this is equal to 1.

285
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,570
If that's equal to 1, then
what's the natural log of 1?

286
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,780
So our change in our mystical
S state variable is nR times

287
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,280
the natural log of 1.

288
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,200
What's the natural log of 1?

289
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,210
E to the what power
is equal to 1?

290
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,690
e to the 0 is equal to 1.

291
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,760
n times R times 0-- I don't
care how big or

292
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,220
whatever-- this is 0.

293
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,990
So it equals 0.

294
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,960
So there we have it.

295
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,260
We've stumbled upon a legitimate
state variable that

296
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,770
deals with heat.

297
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:49,600
If we define change in S is
equal to the heat added to the

298
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,810
system, divided by the
temperature at which the heat

299
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,890
was added to the system,
this is a

300
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,100
legitimate state variable.

301
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,350
Now, we don't have much
intuition about what it really

302
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,860
means at kind of a micro
state level.

303
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,230
But at least we've
stumbled upon

304
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,210
some property of something.

305
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,530
If S is 10 here, and we go
around here, our change in S

306
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,750
will be 0, S is 10 again.

307
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,270
If S is, I don't know, let's
say S is 15 here, and we go

308
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,170
around some crazy cycle and we
come back here, our change in

309
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,860
S is going to be 0 again.

310
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,420
Or sorry, it's going
to be 15 again.

311
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,750
So we didn't have-- our change
in S will be 0, so our s

312
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,470
itself will be 15 again.

313
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,410
So S is a legitimate state
variable, but we don't have a

314
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,795
good sense of what it
actually means.

315
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:34,570
   

316
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,290
We'll leave that to
a future video.

317
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:37,333
