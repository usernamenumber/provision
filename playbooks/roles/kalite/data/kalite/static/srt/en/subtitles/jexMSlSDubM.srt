1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
   

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,540
Everything we've done up to now
has dealt with Cartesian

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,310
coordinates, even though you
might have not realized

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,930
that they were Cartesian
coordinates, because I never

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,290
called it that before just now.

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,420
So what is a Cartesian
coordinate?

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,620
Let me draw the axis
that you're hopefully

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,490
familiar with by now.

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,420
If you're not, review
those videos.

10
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,550
Let me just draw the
y-axis and the x-axis.

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,720
And so, Cartesian coordinates--
and actually, they can apply to

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,830
more than just 2 dimensions.

13
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,190
But 2 dimensions is what
we tend to deal with.

14
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,880
Then if I want to specify any
point in 2 dimensional space, I

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,170
just tell you how far in the x
direction I have to go, and

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,400
how far in the y direction.

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,160
And I can specify that point.

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,150
Like, let's see, if I said,
well, let me give the Cartesian

19
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,590
coordinates for that
point right there.

20
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,550
And I might say, well, to get
to that point right there, I

21
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,570
have to go to the
right 3 steps.

22
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,610
So this is 3, right here.

23
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,650
And then I have to
go up 4 steps.

24
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,510
1, 2, 3, 4.

25
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,640
And you end up there.

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,110
And by convention, we call this
the x-coordinate, and we call

27
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,630
this the y-coordinate, and
we call this 3 comma 4.

28
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,530
And this is just a convention
where we say the first

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,730
coordinate is how far in the x
direction we go, and the second

30
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,250
coordinate is how far in the up
and down, or the y

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,940
direction, we go.

32
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,270
So this is 3 comma 4.

33
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,020
And we could have gone 3 to the
right and 4 up, or we could

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,880
have gone 4 up and
3 to the right.

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,740
And we'd have gotten to
the exact same point.

36
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,440
This is just one way to
really specify a point

37
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,440
in 2 dimensions.

38
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,370
Another option, and you might
have done this in everyday

39
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,490
life, is to say, hey, let me
just point you in a direction,

40
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,680
and then you go a certain
distance in that direction.

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,470
So I could have said,
you know what?

42
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,530
Let me just point you
in this direction.

43
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,940
Let me just point you in
that direction, and you

44
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,970
need to go this far.

45
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,120
You need to go this far
in that direction.

46
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,000
That would also get you
to the same point.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,920
So how do I specify
the direction?

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,840
Well, how about I
call this 0 degrees?

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,420
How about I call
this the x-axis?

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,790
How about I call
that 0 degrees?

51
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,070
And we'll deal with degrees.

52
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,400
But hopefully, you know
how to convert between

53
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,260
degrees and radians.

54
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,810
So you could just as easily
convert to radians.

55
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,270
But you could specify the
direction if you call this 0,

56
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,720
saying, ok, this is theta
degrees, and I want you-- I'm

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,490
going to point you in a degree
in-- you know, you could

58
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,570
always imagine someone
who's blindfolded.

59
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,200
You point them in this
direction and you

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,700
say, walk r units.

61
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,280
And then they'll end up
at that same point.

62
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,740
And so you could also specify
this point-- instead of

63
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,160
specifying, this is the
Cartesian coordinates, this is

64
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,570
x comma y-- you could also
specify it-- maybe, if we can

65
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,710
figure out a way to do it.

66
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,250
And I'll do it in magenta.

67
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,580
You can also specify
it as r comma theta.

68
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,990
Which essentially says,
you know, walk r units

69
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,650
in the theta direction.

70
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,660
Well, let's figure
out what that is.

71
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,360
Because I think it's kind of
abstract now, and might be a

72
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,240
little difficult to understand.

73
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,050
So we're going to break out
a little trigonometry and

74
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,490
actually just a little
Pythagorean theorem.

75
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,090
Can we figure out r and theta?

76
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,010
Well, r, hopefully, is
the easier one here.

77
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,950
Because if you think about it,
this is a right triangle.

78
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,030
This is a right triangle.

79
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,380
That has distance 3.

80
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,410
This is distance 4.

81
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,840
This is a right triangle.

82
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,090
So what is r here?

83
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,630
Pythagorean Theorem.

84
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,260
3 squared plus 4 squared is
equal to the hypotenuse

85
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,580
squared, or r squared.

86
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,890
So we could say, 3 squared
plus 4 squared is

87
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,420
equal to r squared.

88
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,860
That's 9 plus 16 is
equal to r squared.

89
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,880
25 is equal to r squared.

90
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,990
We don't want to deal with
negative distances, so 5 is

91
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,900
equal to r, r is equal to 5.

92
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,380
Fair enough.

93
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,480
So we already figured out
that r is equal to 5.

94
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,900
How do we figure out theta?

95
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,040
So what do we know here?

96
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,950
We know-- well, we're trying
to figure out theta.

97
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,480
And we know it's
opposite side, right?

98
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,370
This is just going
back to SOHCAHTOA.

99
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,140
Let me write down SOHCAHTOA.

100
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,660
If this is completely
unfamiliar to you, you might

101
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,170
want to watch the basic
trigonometry video.

102
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,610
So we know the opposite
side of theta, right?

103
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,570
That's 4.

104
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,950
And we also know
the adjacent side.

105
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,060
That's 3.

106
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,090
So which of the trig
functions uses the

107
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,470
opposite and the adjacent?

108
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,090
Well, the TOA.

109
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,620
Opposite and adjacent.

110
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,750
So tangent.

111
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:21,100
So tangent of theta is equal to
the opposite-- which is really

112
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,680
the y-coordinate, which is
equal to 4-- over the adjacent.

113
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,180
Which is the x-coordinate,
which is 3.

114
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,720
So tangent of theta
is equal to 4/3.

115
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,810
And to solve this, you
essentially just take

116
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,600
the inverse tangent of
both sides of this.

117
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,530
So this is the same thing.

118
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,050
And depending on your
calculator, or the convention

119
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,060
you use, you might write this.

120
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,560
When you take the inverse
tangent of both sides,

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,020
you get-- well, I'll
just write it out.

122
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:53,960
You could write it as the
arctan of the tangent of theta

123
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,020
is equal to the arctan of 4/3.

124
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,150
And this, of course-- the
arctan of the tangent.

125
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,740
This is the same thing
as the inverse tan of

126
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,620
the tangent of theta.

127
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,590
This is just equal to theta.

128
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,220
That just simplifies to theta.

129
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,300
Is equal to arctan of 4/3.

130
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,180
And then another way to write
arctan is often-- they'll often

131
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,310
write it-- I'll write it.

132
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,365
So the same exact statement
could be written as tan inverse

133
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,780
to the negative 1 power.

134
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,460
They sometimes say it.

135
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,020
Although it's a little
misleading sometimes, when

136
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,750
they write it like this.

137
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,300
Because you don't know.

138
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,800
Oh, am I taking the whole
tangent of theta to the

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,900
negative power or something?

140
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,480
But sometimes I'll write arctan
as 10 to the negative 1 power.

141
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,280
But either way.

142
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,610
So we can figure out theta by
taking the arctangent of 4/3.

143
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,160
And most people do not have the
arctangent of 4/3 memorized.

144
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,390
And I don't know an easy way
to figure it out, without

145
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,050
getting my TI-85 out.

146
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,600
So let's get it out.

147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,410
All right.

148
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,190
So how do we know the arctan--
so we want to do this inverse--

149
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,270
let me get the calculator up a
little higher, so you can see.

150
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,550
We want to get this
inverse tan right here.

151
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,440
So you press second inverse
tangent of 4 divided by 3.

152
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,500
And I already set my
calculator to degree mode.

153
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,055
It gives you 53.13 degrees.

154
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:13,320
   

155
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,360
So theta is equal
to 53.13 degrees.

156
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,010
So there you have it.

157
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,610
We already knew that we could
specify this point in the 2

158
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,020
dimensional plane by the point
x is equal to 3,

159
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,550
y is equal to 4.

160
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:30,320
We can also specify it by r
is equal to 5, and theta

161
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,790
is equal to 53 degrees.

162
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,590
So I'll write that.

163
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,430
And polar coordinates, it can
be specified as r is equal to

164
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:42,640
5, and theta is 53.13 degrees.

165
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:50,930
So all that says is, OK, orient
yourself 53.13 degrees

166
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,930
counterclockwise from the
x-axis, and then walk 5 units.

167
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,000
And you'll get to the
exact same point.

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,040
And that's all polar
coordinates are telling you.

169
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,980
Let's do another one.

170
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,640
Actually, before that, let's
see if we can come up with

171
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,020
something general here.

172
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,870
Because once you have the
general, then you can always

173
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,850
solve for the particular.

174
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,510
So let me just write
an arbitrary point.

175
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,980
Last time I gave a
specific point.

176
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,250
The point-- was it 3 comma 4?

177
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,760
I think it was.

178
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,090
So let's say I have
the point x comma y.

179
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,120
It's right there.

180
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,500
So its x-coordinate is there,
its y-coordinate is there.

181
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,580
So how do we convert this to
r, to polar coordinates?

182
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,720
r, theta.

183
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,140
Well, let's do the same thing
we did in the last video.

184
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,770
If this length is r, and
this angle is theta.

185
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,640
So just going into what we
did in the last video.

186
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,750
We use Pythagorean Theorem.

187
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,340
We say that x squared plus--
because this distance

188
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,580
here is also y, right?

189
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,150
This distance here is x.

190
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,446
Pythagorean Theorem, you get
x squared plus y squared

191
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:56,130
is equal to r squared.

192
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,090
That's just the
Pythagorean Theorem.

193
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,460
And then you have the
tangent of theta.

194
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,100
The tangent of this angle.

195
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,690
   

196
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,250
SOHCAHTOA.

197
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,220
TOA.

198
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,670
Opposite over adjacent.

199
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,560
Tangent of theta is equal to
the opposite-- which is y--

200
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,320
over the adjacent-- which is x.

201
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,340
And this is really
all you need.

202
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,530
And if you wanted to go one
step further, and this is

203
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,640
actually something you
should write at the

204
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,490
side of your paper.

205
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,800
How can we express y as
a function if we wanted

206
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,420
to go the other way?

207
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,490
If we were given r and
theta, how could we get y?

208
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,790
Well, let's think about it.

209
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:34,800
y-- if we want to know-- let's
see, if we are given r and y

210
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,160
and we want to figure out
theta-- what deals with the r

211
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,300
and the y, with respect to
theta? r is the hypotenuse

212
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,610
and y is the opposite.

213
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,840
Let me write SOHCAHTOA down.

214
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,830
   

215
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,710
So what deals with the
opposite and the hypotenuse?

216
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,020
   

217
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,950
Sine.

218
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:03,410
So the sine of theta is equal
to the opposite-- which is the

219
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,630
y side, which is equal to y--
over the hypotenuse,

220
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,750
which is r.

221
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,990
Equal to r.

222
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,570
And so if you multiply both
sides by r, you get r

223
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,410
sine theta is equal to y.

224
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,680
And then let's do
it the other way.

225
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,840
What if we wanted to have an
equation for theta, r, and x?

226
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,860
x is adjacent to the angle.

227
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,335
r is still the hypotenuse.

228
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,680
So what deals with
adjacent and hypotenuse?

229
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,820
Well, that's CAH.

230
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,070
Cosine.

231
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,530
So we have the cosine of theta
is equal to the adjacent,

232
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,540
is equal to x, over the
hypotenuse, which is r.

233
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,710
Multiply both sides by r
and you get x is equal

234
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,980
to r cosine theta.

235
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,560
And really, when you're
equipped with this formula--

236
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,060
which really just comes from
our trig identities-- this

237
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,770
formula, which you know, is
similar, just comes

238
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,220
from SOHCAHTOA.

239
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,090
This, which comes from
SOHCAHTOA-- and really

240
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,180
is, you know-- if you're
given these first.

241
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,350
If you're given these two, you
can easily derive that one.

242
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,920
And this one, which is just
the Pythagorean Theorem,

243
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,010
you're actually ready.

244
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,010
You're fully equipped to
convert between polar and

245
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,030
rectangular coordinates.

246
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,480
And we'll do that in the
next video, because I just

247
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,530
realized I'm out of time.

248
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,400
