00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,316
Tina Olsen: We are in the European Galleries of the Portland Art Museum

2
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:05,833
I am Christina Olsen

3
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,613
Maribeth Graybill: And I'm Maribeth Graybill

4
00:00:07,613 --> 00:00:13,049
Tina: And we're standing in front of this incredible object by a follower of Bernardo Daddi

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:21,598
and what we see is a Madonna--the mother of Christ--surrounded by this group of saints and angels

6
00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:24,977
--and this is not just a painting--it's really an object

7
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:33,532
Maribeth: What really draws me to this piece of the many--many Madonna and Christ as infant paintings in this room

8
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:41,799
--is what you've just pointed out that it is not a flat surface--it's not an easel painting

9
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,417
--but the whole thing is in fact a miniature church

10
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:46,334
Tina: Yes!

11
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:52,510
Maribeth: And so that there is the panel--the back-panel which has a steeple above it

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,266
--and then are doors--there's an entry way and these doors can be close

13
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:03,958
--and when they're closed--as we walk around the side--we can see it's just plain gilt

14
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,882
--perhaps gilt leather or gilt wood on the outside

15
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:11,259
--but then when you enter this space--when you open the doors

16
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:13,702
--suddenly you're in the presence of the Madonna

17
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:16,931
Tina: Absolutely--I love that too and I love this way

18
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:22,343
in which you realize that the object was both of course a representation

19
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:28,909
but also something that you the viewer and the devotee have a relationship with

20
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:34,026
--and the doors open and you are in the presence of the Madonna and this scene is revealed to you

21
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:37,482
--and let's talk about this scene because it's really really not just an image of the Madonna

22
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:44,275
but also the story of her life--we see the angel Gabriel on the top left door

23
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:50,110
--and the angel Gabriel comes down from heaven and tells Mary

24
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,201
that she will be the mother of Christ--that she will bear a son

25
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:57,616
Maribeth: The enunciation scene--and what's so wonderful

26
00:01:57,616 --> 00:02:02,177
in these two is the sensitivity of this artist's gestures

27
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:06,616
--so Gabriel raises his right hand to make an announcement

28
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:07,749
Tina: Absolutely!

29
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:12,109
Maribeth: Mary--you know--and she as you've pointed out earlier

30
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:20,392
--places her hand over her heart and inclines her head in this beautifully modest -- "me?..me?"

31
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:31,727
--we can almost hear the conversation between them because it's so dramatically enacted for us

32
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:35,797
Tina: Absolutely! And then below the angel Gabriel

33
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:41,017
--we see in fact the nativity scene when Christ is born in the manger

34
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:43,014
Maribeth: With a cow and a donkey

35
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:46,209
Tina: And angels above with halos

36
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,281
Maribeth: And Joseph below interacting I think with a sheperd

37
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:54,086
--and then over here on the right-hand side is the crucifixion

38
00:02:54,086 --> 00:03:02,218
--Christ on the cross--emaciated--his skin even takes on a sort of deathly pallor

39
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:11,094
--blood is coming from his wounds--and at his feet--standing on the ground-- his moth Mary is swooning

40
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:14,902
--and accompanied by John and other follows of Jesus

41
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:20,725
Tina: And John holds her up in this incredible--and she's just mourning her son has died

42
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:26,219
--and I love the way in which then the object has both an immediate time and also a narrative time

43
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,158
--in other words we come upon it and there the virgin is

44
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:34,040
--but what we see to the left and right is both what has happened before and what will happen to come

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,389
--so this is just this unbelievable sense of presence and kind of multiple senses of time in the object

46
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,208
Maribeth: And it just occurs to me as you say that

47
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:48,153
--that if we think about it--the panels have narrative things

48
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:52,533
--you know--things have happened--things that are recorded in the Bible

49
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:57,171
--but the central panel of Mary enthroned--that's not in the biblical text

50
00:03:57,171 --> 00:04:04,189
--but also because that's presented hieratically--that's eternal--it's outside of time

51
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,206
Tina: And that's the relationship with us

52
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:12,724
--I mean it's really the central panel that is always alive and always speaking to us

53
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:19,647
--as both an image but also an alive efficacious diety
