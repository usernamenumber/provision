1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,485
Let's say that we have the indefinite integral,

2
00:00:03,485 --> 00:00:18,636
and the function is 3x^2 plus 2x times e to the x^3 plus x^2 dx.

3
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:22,756
So how would we go about solving this? So first when you look at it,

4
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:27,102
it seems like a really complicated integral; we have this polynomial right over here

5
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:31,825
being multiplied by this exponential expression and over here, the exponent,

6
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:36,172
we essentially have another polynomial. It seems kind of crazy.

7
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:42,403
And the key intuition here, the key inside is that you might want to use a technique here called

8
00:00:42,403 --> 00:00:50,163
u-substitution. And I'll tell you in a second how I would recognize that we have to use u-substitution,

9
00:00:50,163 --> 00:00:53,573
and over time, you might even be able to do this type of thing in your head.

10
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:59,498
U-substitution is essentially unwinding the chain rule. In the chain rule --

11
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:03,767
I'll go in more depth in another video where I really talk about that intuition.

12
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:09,172
But the way I'd think about it is, well I have this crazy exponent right over here,

13
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:16,895
I have x^3 plus x^2. And this thing right over here happens to be the derivative of

14
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:23,486
x^3 plus x^2. The derivative of x^3 is 3x^2; derivative of x^2 is 2x,

15
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:27,822
which is a huge clue to me that I could use u-substitution.

16
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:33,047
So what I do here is, this thing where this little expression here where I also see its derivative

17
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:43,044
being multiplied, I can set that equal to u. So I can say, "u is equal to x^3 plus x^2."

18
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:46,903
Now what is going to be the derivative of u with respect to x?

19
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:56,887
du/dx (well, we've done this multiple times) is going to be 3x^2 plus 2x,

20
00:01:56,887 --> 00:02:03,497
and now we can write this in differential form. And du/dx isn't really a fraction

21
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:08,700
of differential of u divided by differential of x, it really is a form of notation.

22
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,372
But it is often useful to kind of pretend it's a fraction.

23
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:16,500
And you could kind of view this, if you want to just get a du,

24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,980
if you just want this in differential form over here, how much does u change for given change in x,

25
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:32,771
you can multiply both sides times dx. And so if we were to pretend it's a fraction,

26
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:35,856
and it will give you the correct differential form,

27
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:49,103
you're going to be left with du is equal to 3x^2 plus 2x dx.

28
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:54,350
Now why is this over here, why did I go through the trouble of doing that?

29
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:01,171
Well we see we have a 3x^2 plus 2x, and it's being multiplied by a dx right over here.

30
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:08,695
I could rewrite this original integral as the integral of -- let me do that in that color --

31
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:20,196
of 3x^2 plus 2x times dx times e -- let me do that in that other color --

32
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:28,891
times e to the x^3 plus x^2. Now, what's interesting about this,

33
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:35,771
well this stuff that I have in magenta here is exactly equal to du.

34
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:41,561
And then this stuff I have up here, x^3 plus x^2, that is what I said what u equaled to.

35
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:46,169
That is going to be equal to u. So I could rewrite my entire integral --

36
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:49,700
and now you might recognize why this might simplify things a good bit --

37
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,222
it's going to be equal to, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to change the order.

38
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:57,297
I'm going to put the du, this entire du, I'm going to stick it on the other side here

39
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:01,704
so it looks like more of the standard form that we're used to seeing in our indefinite integrals in,

40
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:15,495
so it's going to be, we're going to have our du times e to the u.

41
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:20,892
And so what would the anti-derivative of this be in terms of u?

42
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:25,958
Well, the derivative of e^u is e^u; the anti-derivative of e^u is e^u.

43
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:32,412
So it's going to be equal to e^u, now there's a possibility that there's some type of constant

44
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:38,292
factor here, so let me write that. So plus C. And now, to get it in terms of x,

45
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:43,096
we just have to un-substitute the u. We know what u is equal to.

46
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:47,030
So we could say that this is going to be equal to e -- instead of writing u,

47
00:04:47,030 --> 00:05:00,349
we could say u is x^3 plus x^2. And then we have our plus C. And we are done!

48
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:04,084
We've found the anti-derivative. And I encourage you to take the derivative of this,

49
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:08,084
and I think you will find yourself using the chain rule and getting right back to what we had over here.
