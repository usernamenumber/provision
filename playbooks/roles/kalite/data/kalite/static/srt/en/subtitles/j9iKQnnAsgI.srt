1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,510
We are on problem number six.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,340
If there is no waste,

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,390
how many square yards of carpeting is needed

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,960
to cover a rectangular floor that is 12 feet by 18 feet?

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,030
So I can just draw it like that. And it's 12 feet by 18 feet.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,720
And the trick here is, they're not asking how many feet,

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,820
they're asking how many square yards of carpeting.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,460
So the easiest thing to do really at this point,

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,690
is to convert the dimensions of the room to yards.

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,590
And they tell us 3 feet make a yard.

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,910
So 18 feet, that's the same thing as what?

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,370
Divide by 3, and you get, that's 6 yards. 6 yards is 18 feet.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,540
And you divide by 3, you get 4 yards.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,700
I always find the arithmetic the hardest part.

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,140
4 yards is equal to 12 feet, right? 4 times 3 is equal to 12.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,470
So now this is a 6 by 4, so 6 yards times 4 yards is equal to

17
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,500
24 square yards. That's choice C.

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,500
And the mistake, if you got this wrong, you might have just--

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,540
well one, you might have multiplied 12 times 18

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,660
and gotten a very large number and said,

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,260
oh, that's the answer.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,770
But then your answer would've been in feet.

23
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,780
Then the other mistake you might have done is

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,580
you might have multiplied 12 times 18--

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,170
you might done this, 12 times 18 divided by 3.

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,290
Because you said, oh well, 3 feet is equal to a yard.

27
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,450
And that is a mistake

28
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,340
because you're now converting square feet to square yards.

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,430
And it's actually-- you should have divided by 9

30
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,950
because there's actually 9 square feet per square yard.

31
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,140
Why is that? Because if I had--

32
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,720
let's say this is a 1 square yard, right?

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,660
That means it's going to be 3 feet on that side,

34
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,020
3 feet on that side. So it's actually 9 square feet.

35
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,440
So if you figured out the area in feet first,

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,330
you had to divide by 9, not by 3.

37
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,860
That probably was the most common mistake,

38
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,190
assuming that you realized that you had to convert units.

39
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,610
Next problem.

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,450
Problem seven. A certain scale only registers weights

41
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,420
that are greater than 6 pounds. OK, fair enough.

42
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,600
A person who wanted to know the weights of a puppy,

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,240
a kitten and a bunny-- very cute-- weighed them in pairs

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,810
and got the following results.

45
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,090
Kitten plus bunny weighed 7 pounds.

46
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,650
Kitten plus puppy is 8.

47
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,400
And bunny plus puppy is 9.

48
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,800
This is by far the cutest problem I've ever done.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,460
What is the weight of the puppy? So we want to solve for P.

50
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,390
Well, if we're going to solve for P, the best thing

51
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,950
we could do is we want to use these two equations.

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,440
But we have three-- if we just look at these two equations,

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,900
we have three unknowns with two equations.

54
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,400
So let's use this equation to substitute into this equation.

55
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,090
So let's say we want to replace this K.

56
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,120
So we can use this top equation to say that

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,140
K is equal to 7 minus B.

58
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,840
So if we substitute that into this equation, we'll get--

59
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,450
so let me just-- this is 7 minus B, so we'll get 7 minus B--

60
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,500
and I'm just rewriting this top equation, that's this--

61
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,790
plus P is equal to 8.

62
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,820
And then this bottom equation still is B plus P is equal to 9

63
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,490
I could add the 7 or subtract 7 from both sides right now,

64
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,160
but I'm just going to actually add the equations,

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,240
because I like how these B's are going to cancel out.

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,280
I get excited about canceling variables.

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,230
So-- actually, no let me subtract 7 from both sides first.

68
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,870
So if we take 7 from here, than this 8 becomes a 1, right?

69
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,930
I just subtracted 7 from both sides.

70
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,620
So negative B plus P is equal to 1.

71
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,380
Now I just add these two equations.

72
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,790
And what's minus B plus B?

73
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,190
It's 0 plus P plus P is 2P is equal to 1 plus 9 is 10.

74
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,830
2P equals 10. P is equal to 5. Choice D.

75
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,900
5 pounds, that's how much the puppy weighs.

76
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,810
Which shows us the bunny weighs 2 pounds,

77
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,930
and the kitten weighs 3 pounds. Which is--

78
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,140
it looks like they actually thought about how much a puppy,

79
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,620
a bunny and a kitten would actually weigh,

80
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,190
which I have to give them credit for.

81
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,710
Next problem. Problem eight.

82
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:48,800
On a blueprint, 1/4 inch represents 16 feet in real life.

83
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,730
If a driveway is 40 feet long,

84
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,190
what is its length in inches on the map?

85
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,840
So a driveway-- that's a driveway, I don't know,

86
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,140
that's my driveway. And it's 40 feet long.

87
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,620
So how many of these units is it going to be?

88
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,920
Well, actually-- we could do it a bunch of different ways.

89
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,370
We could say 1/4 of an inch is equal to 16 feet.

90
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,110
If we multiply both sides of this relationship by 4,

91
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:32,730
you get 1 inch is equal to 64 feet. 1 inch--

92
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,140
I just multiplied both sides of this relationship by 4.

93
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,620
So if you want to figure out

94
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,660
how many inches this would represent,

95
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,210
you would say, well, x is how many inches it would represent

96
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:51,180
over 1 inch is equal to this length, 40 feet, over 64.

97
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,330
It's the same fraction.

98
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,090
And of course, if you divide by 1, this cancels out.

99
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,860
So you're left with x, which is its representation in inches,

100
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,480
is equal to 40/64.

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,250
Well you could divide the top and the bottom by 8,

102
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,670
so that becomes 5/8. 40 divided by 5. 64 divided by 8.

103
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:21,990
x is equal to 5/8. And that is choice B. Next problem.

104
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,070
There's a bunch of ways you could have don e it.

105
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,460
This is the way that occurred to me.

106
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,800
Next problem, problem nine. In the xy-coordinate system,

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,680
p comma 0 is one of the points of intersection of the graphs-

108
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,600
OK, so they're giving us two graphs.

109
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,620
y is equal to minus x squared plus 9,

110
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:50,120
and the other graph is y is equal to x squared minus 9.

111
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:59,150
If p is positive, what is the value of p?

112
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,230
So they're saying that the coordinate

113
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,990
where they intersect is p comma 0.

114
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,010
So we want to figure out the x-coordinate

115
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:12,170
where they intersect. So the easy way--

116
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,360
you know, they're tempting you to add these equations

117
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,450
and do all sorts of things,

118
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,410
but we know that they intersect at the point y is equal to 0.

119
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,300
They're telling us that,

120
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,750
so we don't have to do all this fancy stuff.

121
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,990
We don't have to figure out where they intersect.

122
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,160
They tell us it intersects at y equals 0.

123
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,840
So y equals 0, what's x in either of these situations?

124
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,110
Well, let's take this second equation.

125
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,940
0 is equal to x squared minus 9.

126
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,370
Add 9 to both sides, you get x squared is equal to 9.

127
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,830
I added 9 and switched the sides.

128
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,640
You get x is equal to plus or minus 3.

129
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,820
And they tell us, that if p is positive,

130
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,460
what is the value of p? Well, it has to be plus 3 then.

131
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,420
And that is choice A.And you could have used the top equation

132
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,380
You could have said 0 is equal to negative x squared plus 9.

133
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,240
You would've gotten the same thing.

134
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,010
You would've gotten x squared is equal to 9,

135
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,620
x is equal to plus or minus 3.

136
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,340
You would've gotten the same thing either way. Next problem.

137
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,840
I don't know if I'm going to have time to do it in this video

138
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,890
I might have to do it in the next. Problem ten.

139
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,550
The Smith Metal Company's old machine makes

140
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,460
300 bolts per hour. 300-- I'll call it b per h.

141
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,520
Its new machine makes 450 bolts per hour.

142
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,680
If both machines begin running at the same time,

143
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
how many minutes will it take the two machines

144
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,280
to make a total of 900 bolts? So how many minutes?

145
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,640
So let's say m for minutes.

146
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,480
So the total number of bolts they're going to produce--

147
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:56,250
so bolts is going to be equal-- so this is per hour, right?

148
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,210
These are both per hour. So let's figure it out minutes,

149
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,990
because they're asking us how many minutes will it take.

150
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,420
So if you make 300 bolts in an hour,

151
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,720
you're going to make 1/60 that in a minute.

152
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,600
So what's 1/60 of 300?

153
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,610
Well, 300 divided by 60 is 5 bolts per minute.

154
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,110
And this one-- what's 450 divided by 60?

155
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,350
Actually, I'm going to run out of time.

156
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,860
I'm going to do this problem in the next video.

157
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,890
I'll see you soon.
