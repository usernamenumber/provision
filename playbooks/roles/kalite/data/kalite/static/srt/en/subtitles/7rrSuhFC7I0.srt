1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,550
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,820
In the previous video we had
this very positive scenario,

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,770
where I had originally bought
a house for $1.5 million.

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,950
Then a year later, the value of
the house, or at least my

6
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,280
perceived value of the house,
went up to $1.5 million,

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,530
because my neighbors sold
their identical

8
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,210
house for $1.5 million.

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,570
And so my initial equity
investment went from $250,000

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,500
to $750,000.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,110
And why is that?

12
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,320
Well equity is nothing but, if
I have an asset that's worth

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,390
$1.5 million, and I owe
$750,000-- that was my

14
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,820
original mortgage on that
asset-- then what I'm left

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,480
with is the equity.

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,810
So my equity just tripled.

17
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,600
It went from $250,000
to $750,000.

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,240
In this video, what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show

19
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,810
you, well, what can you
do with that equity?

20
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,950
I mean, it's not cash.

21
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,000
It's kind of like this make
believe amount of wealth that

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,060
you have. You just
feel richer.

23
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,580
And I'll show you that you can
actually turn it into cash

24
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,220
using something called
a home equity loan.

25
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,350
And I'd argue that this is
actually what drove our

26
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,910
economy from about 2002 to
probably still, to this day.

27
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,520
Although I think we're
in a recession now.

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,840
In fact I'm about 100%
sure we are.

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,300
But definitely until
about 2006.

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,350
So what's a home equity loan?

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,500
Well I go to the bank.

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,100
I say, wow, bank, I have this
$750,000 of equity.

33
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,470
I wish -- I'm rich, but I
don't have this in cash.

34
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,540
I want to do something, though,
with the equity.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,830
I would like to live
like a rich person.

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,940
Well the bank says, Sal,
you know, you're right.

37
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,970
Our only requirement is that
you have $250,000-- or our

38
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,260
only requirement is that
you have 25% equity

39
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,790
in your house, right?

40
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,470
Because they want a cushion in
case you can't pay and they

41
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,870
get the house back, and they
have to foreclose, and auction

42
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,330
off the house, et cetera,
et cetera.

43
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,590
So they said, well, we're
willing to lend you up to 75%

44
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,220
of the value of your house.

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,120
So what's 75% of the
value of my house?

46
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:58,390
So let's see, 1.5 times 75%,
let's see that would be

47
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,470
$750,000 plus half
of $750,000.

48
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:09,270
It'll be 1.075 million,
I think.

49
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,530
I did that in my head,
it could be wrong.

50
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,170
But it's roughly the
right number.

51
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,080
So the bank says, you know what,
we're willing to lend

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,820
you up to 75% of the value
of your asset.

53
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,400
And it's of course going to be
guaranteed by this asset.

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,850
So far, we lent you $750,000.

55
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,660
So let's see how much you
have more that you

56
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,500
can borrow from us.

57
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,420
Minus -- we're talking millions
-- that's 0.075.

58
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:34,940
So that's what?

59
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:42,710
300, that's 250 plus 75, so up
to $325,000 more that you

60
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,380
could borrow.

61
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,530
And what is this?

62
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,180
Where am I taking this
money out of?

63
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,100
Well I'm essentially taking this
money out of the equity

64
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,860
of my house.

65
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,190
And how does that make sense?

66
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,440
Well, what's going to happen?

67
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,550
   

68
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,560
Let's say I take this loan.

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,380
Let's say I say, bank, great.

70
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:08,180
I want $325,000 in cash.

71
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,530
I want it right now.

72
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,340
So what happens?

73
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,990
Let me draw another series,
another balance sheet.

74
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,690
I stopped using the word balance
sheet, even though

75
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,690
that was the original purpose
of this whole discussion.

76
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,120
I'll draw it a little
bit bigger.

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,110
Remember liabilities plus
equities are equal to assets.

78
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,500
   

79
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,720
So what are my assets now?

80
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:47,040
So now I have a $1.5 million
house, and I also got $325,000

81
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:55,280
cash from the bank, so we
can call that 325K cash.

82
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,860
Got it from the bank.

83
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,640
Now what are my liabilities?

84
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,050
Well I have the original
mortgage on my house.

85
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,170
   

86
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,080
The original mortgage
is $750,000.

87
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,680
This is liabilities
on this side.

88
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,696
Well not the whole side,
we're going to

89
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,390
have equity down here.

90
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,500
So just this is liability,
$750,000.

91
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,060
And then I took a new loan to
get this $325,000 of cash.

92
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,480
So I have a new loan here,
that amount is $325,000.

93
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,150
And this was a home
equity loan.

94
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,690
I took a loan against
the equity that

95
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,420
I have in my house.

96
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,030
This was the equity
in my house.

97
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,690
So what's the leftover equity?

98
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,430
Let me just make everything
clear.

99
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,210
These are liabilities.

100
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,442
These are assets.

101
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:44,200
And equity is what you
have leftover.

102
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,640
So what are my assets?

103
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:55,220
I have $1.825 million in assets,
minus -- now what are

104
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,440
my liabilities?

105
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:05,230
Minus $1.075 -- that was the
max that I could borrow --

106
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,110
liabilities.

107
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,630
Assets minus liabilities
is owners equity.

108
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,710
So let's see, 825 minus 75.

109
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,570
I still have $750,000
of equity.

110
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,710
And that makes sense.

111
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,500
If I just enter into some
transaction where I get cash

112
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,680
in exchange for debt, my equity
shouldn't change.

113
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,500
But now what does happen?

114
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,960
Well I have this cash, and I'm
feeling rich, because I've

115
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,800
never seen numbers
like $750,000.

116
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,100
And that neighbor, that new
neighbor that just bought that

117
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,720
house right next door for $1.5
million, he just bought a

118
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,060
beautiful new Hummer.

119
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,990
And being a very down-to-earth
person, I feel that I also

120
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,660
deserve a Hummer, like my
neighbor, because I am just as

121
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,570
rich as they are.

122
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,260
So I go decide to go out
and I'm going to spend

123
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,940
$100,000 on a Hummer.

124
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,260
Actually, let's not do a Hummer,
because a Hummer could

125
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,890
actually be considered
an asset.

126
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,460
I want pure consumption.

127
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,050
Although I think a Hummer is as
pretty close as a car gets

128
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,160
to pure consumption.

129
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,430
Let's say that neighbor went on
a round-the-world vacation

130
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,050
for $100,000.

131
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,830
And I too, because I did nothing
but sit on my house

132
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,710
and made $500,000 last year, I
feel that I also deserve a

133
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,730
$100,000 vacation.

134
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,230
So what I do is I take $100,000
of this cash.

135
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,930
So I'm now left with just
$225,000, and I have the great

136
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,940
experience of going
on a vacation.

137
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,980
But of course I didn't get any
asset in return for that.

138
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,820
Although maybe your happiness
is an asset, I don't know.

139
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,840
But it doesn't show up on
your balance sheet.

140
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,780
So we had $325,000 in cash.

141
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:51,930
Now we have $225,000 in cash.

142
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,410
So our total assets went
down about $100,000.

143
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,160
What are our assets now?

144
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,550
It's $1.725 right?

145
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,840
Because we spent $100,000
of our cash.

146
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,780
So what's going to be the
liabilities and equity?

147
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,360
Well the liabilities won't
change, right?

148
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,885
Just because I went on vacation,
the bank's not going

149
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,890
to say, hey Sal, you
owe us less money.

150
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,300
I still owe the almost
$1.075 million.

151
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,380
The $100,000 is going to come
all out of my equity.

152
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,160
So now all of a sudden I
don't have $750,000.

153
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,170
I only have $650,000.

154
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,060
And this isn't the balance
sheet just for my house.

155
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,960
This is kind of my whole
personal balance sheet.

156
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,255
And now my whole personal
balance

157
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:35,780
sheet, what just happened?

158
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,440
I just took some of that
original equity that I had.

159
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,060
I took $100,000 of it, turned it
into cash, and just went on

160
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,610
a great one-year-long
vacation.

161
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,980
And this is what home
equity loans are.

162
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,840
And this is what, I would argue,
drove the economy.

163
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,310
Or at least took us into
an expansionary stage

164
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,560
from 2002 to 2003.

165
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,150
Because if you remember, a lot
of people were still getting

166
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,780
laid off in 2002, 2003,
but consumer

167
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,910
spending kept going up.

168
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,300
So people are earning
less money, or they

169
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,010
don't even have a job.

170
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,330
How is spending going up?

171
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,240
Well, the values of their
house went up, and they

172
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,190
borrowed against the value
of their house.

173
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,760
They took cash out of it, and
they used that cash to buy

174
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,240
their Hummers, to go on
vacation, to buy fancy

175
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,130
clothes, whatever.

176
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,710
And that drove the economy.

177
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,270
And in the next video I'll
actually talk about, maybe,

178
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,820
why those housing
prices go up.

179
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,590
Or why they went up, in
particular, during this

180
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,429
housing boom, this one that
we're definitely in the

181
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,340
process of getting out of.

182
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,080
See you in the next video.
