1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's do a bunch more of these addition problems.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:12,420
So let's say I have 9,367 plus 2,459.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,381
So we can do this the exact same way

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,730
we've done in the last few videos.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,620
We start in the 1's place

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,340
or you can even think of it as the 1's column.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,590
So you're going to add the 7 1's plus the 9 1's.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,326
So you're going to have 7 plus 9,

9
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:29,080
which we hopefully know by now is 16.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,260
So what we do is we write the 6 in the 1's place

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,654
and we carry the 1.

12
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:38,850
Let me switch-- if this 1 is going to be

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,370
the same thing as that 1 right there.

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,120
And this might look like a little bit of a mystery or magic,

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,460
and the whole reason we did that is that

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,805
this is the 10's place.

17
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:50,870
And when you write 16 you have six 1's and one 10.

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,610
If you view this as money, what's the best way

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,360
to get $16 in a world where there weren't $5 bills?

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,875
Where you only had $1 bills, $10 bills,

21
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,070
$100 bills, and so on.

22
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,440
Only multiples of 10.

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,950
And we don't have any $5 bills.

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,670
In that world you would represent 16

25
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,930
as one $10 bill just like that.

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,149
And then six $1 bills.

27
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:20,204
So that's two $1 bills.

28
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:22,460
That's two more $1 bills.

29
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,546
And then that's two more $1 bills.

30
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,919
The whole reason why I'm drawing it this way

31
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:33,570
or I'm even using this analogy or drawing the dollar bills

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,890
is to show you what these places mean.

33
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,900
When I say that this right here is the 10's place,

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,413
I'm essentially telling you

35
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:46,199
how many $10 bills do I have?

36
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:48,643
If I've $16 and I'm doing it

37
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:52,380
as efficiently as I can in a world without $5 bills.

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,331
I only have $1's, $10's, and $100's

39
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:55,850
and $1,000's bills and so forth.

40
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,630
And this is the 1's.

41
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,190
So when I write it this way I'm literally telling you,

42
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,050
I have one $10 bill and I have six $1 bills.

43
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,470
That's what $16 is.

44
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,876
And so when I have 7 plus 9 is equal to 16

45
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:15,780
I say that I have six $1 bills and I have one $10 bill.

46
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,760
And I add that one $10 bill

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,250
to everything else in the ten space.

48
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,770
And the tens place is essentially telling you

49
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,560
how many-- that's the tens.

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,159
I could write it like that

51
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,957
or I could write the 10's place.

52
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:31,850
When I have 67-- 67 means I have six $10 bills

53
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,470
plus another seven $1's.

54
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,400
So that's six 10's, five 10's.

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,690
So I add up everything in the tens place.

56
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,170
So 1 plus 6 plus 5.

57
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,160
Let me do that in a new color.

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,800
1 plus 6 plus 5 is equal to-- 1 plus 6 is 7.

59
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,015
7+5 is 12

60
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:53,163
So I write 2 in the tens place.

61
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:56,900
Because, remember, this is twelve $10 bills.

62
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,722
Right we're in the 10's place.

63
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:02,250
So I have two in the 10's place and I put the 1--

64
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,240
I carried this 1 right here into the 100's place.

65
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,950
Because if I have twelve $10 bills, I have $120.

66
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,070
I have one $100 bill.

67
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,010
And I have two $10 bills.

68
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,189
I'll stop going to the dollar bill analogy

69
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:19,162
just so we can make sure we understand the process.

70
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:20,690
But I think you see how it works.

71
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,800
You start at the right, you add the 2 numbers up.

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,930
If it's a 2-digit answer you carry the left most digit

73
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,980
up to the next column.

74
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,490
And you just keep doing that.

75
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,720
So let's do this one right here.

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,580
1 plus 3 is 4.

77
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,270
Let me write this down in another color.

78
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,349
1 plus 3 plus 4.

79
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:41,386
1 plus 3 is 4.

80
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:43,117
Plus 4 is 8.

81
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:45,680
So 1 plus 3 plus 4 is 8.

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,630
Nothing to carry.

83
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,290
It was a one-digit number.

84
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,652
And then finally, I have 9 plus 2.

85
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:57,561
That's equal to 11, so I write the 1 down there.

86
00:03:57,561 --> 00:03:59,300
I write this 1 and then if there was anything left here

87
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,363
I would carry the 10's or the other 1--

88
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:05,944
the 1 in the 10's place in 11-- I would carry it.

89
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:07,265
But there's no where to carry it to,

90
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,080
so I write it down just like that.

91
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:16,830
So 9.367 plus 2,459 is 11,826.

92
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,530
And I just put that comma there

93
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,834
because it's easier for me to read.

94
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:21,160
Let me do a bunch more of these.

95
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,110
Let's do a really, really daunting problem.

96
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,770
Let's do something in the millions.

97
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,435
Just to show you that you can do any problem.

98
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:37,860
So let's say we have 2,349,015.

99
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,180
Let's throw a 0 in there.

100
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,970
We have nothing in the hundreds place there.

101
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,725
And I want to add that to

102
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:44,926
-- let me switch colors just for fun.

103
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:50,327
I want to add that to 7 million,

104
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:56,172
-- let's put a 0 there-- 15,999.

105
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:57,364
Let's add these two numbers.

106
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,970
It seems like a hard problem,

107
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,431
but if we just focus on each of the places

108
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:03,677
I think you'll find that it's not too bad.

109
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:07,712
So we start off with 5 plus 9.

110
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:09,970
That's equal to 14.

111
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,210
Write the 4 down here, carry the 1.

112
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,490
Then you go into the 10's place.

113
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,880
1 plus 1 is 2.

114
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,260
2 plus 9-- let me switch colors.

115
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,740
1 plus 1 is 2.

116
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,130
2 plus 9 is 11.

117
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,050
Carry the 1.

118
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,530
Now we're in the 100's place.

119
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,970
1 plus 0 is 1.

120
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,070
Plus 9 is 10.

121
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,935
So we write the 0 from the 10, carry the 1.

122
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,630
Let me switch colors again.

123
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,740
1 plus 9 is 10.

124
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,360
10 plus 5 is 15.

125
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,580
Now we're in the 10,000's place.

126
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,730
1 plus 4 is 5.

127
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,110
And 5 plus 1 is 6.

128
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,900
And there's nothing to carry.

129
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,030
Now we're in the 100,000's place.

130
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,011
3-- we have nothing to carry,

131
00:05:57,011 --> 00:05:58,759
so we just have the three 100,000's

132
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,960
plus zero 100,000's. Well, that's just 300,000.

133
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,130
And then finally, we're in the millions place.

134
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,550
2,000,000 plus 7,000,000 is 9,000,000.

135
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,360
Just like that.

136
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,170
So this was a super crazy number.

137
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:17,960
2,349,015 plus 7,015,999.

138
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,286
Just by keeping track of our places

139
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:22,143
and carrying the 2-digit numbers

140
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:24,507
or the 2nd digit in the 2-digit numbers as necessary,

141
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:25,210
we were able to figure out

142
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:31,570
that the answer is 9,365,014.

143
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,400
So hopefully this gives you a pretty good sense.

144
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,408
And let me just do one more,

145
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:38,012
just to really make sure that we really understand

146
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:41,107
how all of this carrying business works.

147
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:58,490
So let's do 15,999,001 plus 6,888,999.

148
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,850
Let's just see how this one's going to turn out.

149
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,140
This seems like a like a difficult problem.

150
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,330
But once again, if we just focus and don't get lost,

151
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,350
we're going to get the right answer hopefully.

152
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,210
So 1 plus 9 is 10.

153
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,410
Write the 0, carry the 1.

154
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,420
1 plus 0 plus 9 is 10.

155
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,180
Write the 0, carry the 1.

156
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,360
1 plus 0 plus 9.

157
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,170
That's 10 again.

158
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,980
Write the 0, carry the 1.

159
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,790
Now 1 plus 9 is 10, plus 8.

160
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,810
10 plus 8 is 18.

161
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,460
Write the 8, carry the 1.

162
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,940
1 plus 9 is 10.

163
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,410
Plus eight is 18.

164
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,270
Write the 8, carry the 1.

165
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,890
1 plus 9 is 10.

166
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,080
Plus 8 is 18.

167
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,980
Write the 8, carry the 1.

168
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,260
Now we're in the 1,000,000's place.

169
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,700
1,000,000 plus 5,000,000 is 6,000,000.

170
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,310
Plus 6,000,000 is 12,000,000.

171
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,573
Write the 2,000,000 and then carry the 1

172
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:03,730
because 12,000,000 is 2,000,000 plus 10,000,000.

173
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,420
10,000,000 plus 10,000,000.

174
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,460
This is one 10,000,000 plus another one 10,000,000.

175
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,880
That's 1 plus 1 is 2.

176
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,070
And then we are done.

177
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:23,450
15,999,001 plus 6,888,999 is 22,888,000.

178
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,703
So you just saw,

179
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:28,635
we're just doing 7 and 8 digit number additions,

180
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:29,590
but you could apply this--

181
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,065
if I had a number with 100 digits in it,

182
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,540
you could do the exact same thing.

183
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,132
You just have to start at the right,

184
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:36,879
go each column by each column,

185
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,489
and then if you end up with a two-digit answer

186
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:41,802
when you add the two one-digit numbers,

187
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:43,360
you just carry the 10's place.

188
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,720
You just doing that and work your way left.

189
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,798
And if you make no errors,

190
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:49,000
you'll get the right answer.
