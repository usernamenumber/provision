1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,940
In the last video we defined
our random variable x as the

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,710
number of heads we get after
flipping a coin five times,

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,690
and it's a fair coin.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,160
And then we figured out the
different probabilities that

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,980
the random variable could
take on different values.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,570
Let me rewrite them all here.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,650
The probability that we
get exactly one head or

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,175
zero heads-- actually,
let's start there.

9
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:23,300
The probability we get zero
heads, and that's the same

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,800
thing as getting five tails--
we figured out was 1 out of 32.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,960
The probability of getting
1 head we figured

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,350
out was 5 over 32.

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,540
The probability of getting 2
heads-- probability that our

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,320
random variable is equal
to 2, what was that?

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,300
I think it was 10/32.

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,250
Yeah, it was 10/32 or 5/16.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,730
10/32 which is equal to 5/16.

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,360
The probability that we get
three heads, that was actually

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,830
equal to the same thing, 10/32
which is equal to 5/16 .

20
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,640
And that made sense because
the probability of getting 3

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,700
heads is the same thing as a
probability of getting 2 tails.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,890
And the probability of getting
2 tails should really be the

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,760
same thing as the probability
of getting 2 heads.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,220
And then finally, or almost
finally, the probability that

25
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:25,990
we get 4 heads, that was equal
to 5/32, which also makes sense

26
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,460
because the probability of
getting 4 heads is the same

27
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,760
thing as the probability
of getting 1 tail, right?

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,190
And 1 tail should be the same
thing as 1 head, so that's why

29
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,430
these numbers are the same.

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,810
And then finally, the
probability that we get all 5

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,750
heads, which is the same thing
as getting no tails, is 1/32.

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,620
The probability of no tails
is the same thing as the

33
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,060
probability as no heads.

34
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,210
So let's draw this.

35
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,190
Let's draw our probability
distribution.

36
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,610
OK, let me draw the x-axis.

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,700
That's not thick enough.

38
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,230
I'll do it a different color.

39
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,130
All right, and just let
me try draw the y-axis.

40
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,130
Almost there.

41
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,310
All right, so what are the
different values that we care

42
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,500
about for our random variable?

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,020
Notice, these are all
discreet values.

44
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,930
They're all particular finite
numbers that we care that our

45
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,970
random variable can take on.

46
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,680
And that was actually a
function of our definition of

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,100
the random variable, right?

48
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,720
This random variable, number of
heads after 5 flips-- you can't

49
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,010
have an infinite number
of values here.

50
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,070
Your value can either be 0
through 5, and it can't

51
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,450
be a non-integer even.

52
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,800
But the important thing to
realize that there's a finite

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,460
number of values that this
random variable can take on and

54
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,890
that's why we have a discreet
probability distribution.

55
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,520
All right, so the probability
that it takes on-- let me just

56
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:11,050
draw 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

57
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,130
This is for our
random variable, x.

58
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,710
So this is the number
of heads in 5 trials.

59
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,510
Let me draw the
high points first.

60
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,250
So let's see, the high points
are-- they're all right there.

61
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,000
10/32.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,560
That's the probability of 2
and 3 and they're the same.

63
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,260
Let me draw little bar graph.

64
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,520
So 2 and 3; let's just say that
this is 10/32 right there.

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,100
I'll draw them the highest
because those are

66
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,040
the highest values.

67
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,120
2 and 3 both hit 10/32.

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,110
Actually, let me draw it
a little differently.

69
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,890
Let me make it so they
touch each other.

70
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,920
So let's say 2 is there,
and then we draw 3.

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,295
And 3 is also there.

72
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,330
There you go.

73
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,070
All right, what's the
probability that you get 1?

74
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,130
That was 5/32, so
that's 1/2 of these.

75
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,280
These two should be
the same height.

76
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,420
So that's 5/32.

77
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,350
Should be like that.

78
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,200
That's the same thing
as getting 4 heads,

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,740
so that's like that.

80
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,680
Let's assume that
this 4 is down here.

81
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,510
The probability of
getting either 0 or

82
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,710
5 is the same thing.

83
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,330
That's 1.

84
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,870
So that's going to be
1/5 of this height.

85
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,650
So it's going to look
something like that.

86
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,485
Let's say this last
one is for 5.

87
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:34,690
The drawing is the
hardest part.

88
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,930
That's going to look
something like that.

89
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,470
All right, and so this is for 5
and this is for 4 right here.

90
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:47,150
And this right here
is 10/32 or 5/16.

91
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,870
This is 5/32.

92
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,820
And this right here is 1/32.

93
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,850
What I have just drawn is
a binomial probability

94
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,710
distribution.

95
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,010
It's a particular
instance of the binomial

96
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,420
probability distribution.

97
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,180
And actually, as you get to
kind of an infinite number of

98
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,210
values, and once we get to the
continuous, this'll approach

99
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,510
the famous bell curve that
you hear about where

100
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,580
things actually start
looking like a bell.

101
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,260
Or it'll start
looking like that.

102
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,500
And we'll do some-- maybe I'll
get Excel out and I'll do it

103
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,090
where I start saying-- instead
of saying, the number

104
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,470
of heads in 5 trials.

105
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:33,040
If I did this as the number of
heads in 5 million trials,

106
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,630
these bars would get very, very
close together and you'd start

107
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,500
seeing them approach this thing
that looks like a bell curve.

108
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,800
And this is a very
important distribution.

109
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,600
One, because it actually
describes a lot of

110
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,820
random processes.

111
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,610
But it's actually very
important to statistics

112
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,190
generally because a lot of
times in statistics you don't

113
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,630
know the underlying mechanism
that's generating your results

114
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,470
and you just assume that
there's just a bunch of

115
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,270
random stuff going on.

116
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,340
You just add up a bunch
of random events.

117
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,440
When you're adding up random
events that's like counting

118
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,550
the number of heads.

119
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,470
So you assume that a lot
of things have-- well,

120
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,900
in the discreet case, a
binomial distribution.

121
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,920
And then, in a few videos
from now I'll show you the

122
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,350
continuous cases, which is
the normal distribution.

123
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,430
And this is really important
to realize because sometimes

124
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,550
people make that assumption
about certain things and the

125
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,960
biggest one-- and this is
probably the most negative

126
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,540
repercussions, especially in
this type of financial

127
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:27,940
environment.

128
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,160
Well, they'll assume that some
process has a binomial or a

129
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,220
normal distribution where
it really doesn't.

130
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,140
Because if you assume that
something has a distribution

131
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,340
like this you start saying,
oh, well the probabilities at

132
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,745
these ends are really low.

133
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:42,810
But what if the distribution
is something like this?

134
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,920
And I'll do more work on this.

135
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,340
I don't want to get too
advanced too fast.

136
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,360
But the general idea, it's
really important to understand

137
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
the assumption you're making
when someone says, oh, we

138
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,680
assume it's a normal
distribution.

139
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,970
We assume it's a
binomial distribution.

140
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,650
But with that said, that's
a little bit of a nugget

141
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,360
of why this is important
going into the future.

142
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,820
But just to kind of review
a little more what we've

143
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,270
already studied, let's
think about this.

144
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,940
Why is this called a
binomial distribution?

145
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,820
Well, if you think about it,
when you flipped 5 coins or

146
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,320
when you had 5 flips of the
same coin-- each arrangement,

147
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,075
I'll pick an arbitrary
arrangement of heads and tails.

148
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:22,530
Each circumstance of heads and
tails, I guess I could call it.

149
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,290
You know, that's one
of them, 5 flips.

150
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,480
Each of these have exactly
a 1 in 32 probability.

151
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,710
In fact, there's exactly
32 ways I can draw some

152
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,800
combination of heads
and tails here.

153
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,580
So each of those have a
1 in 32 probability.

154
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,840
And what we essentially did in
the last video when we said,

155
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,650
OK, what was the probability
of getting exactly two heads?

156
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,290
We essentially said, OK, how
many of these circumstances, or

157
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,810
how many of these-- I guess we
could call it-- how many of

158
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,130
these permutations had 2 heads?

159
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,600
And we counted them up and we
said, 10 of them have 2 heads

160
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,010
and that's why the probability
was 10 out of 32.

161
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,630
And the way we figured
that out is for example,

162
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,760
if we said, 2 heads.

163
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,920
We said, OK, 1 of 5 flips could
be the first head, and then 1

164
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,910
of 4 flips could be
the second head.

165
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,440
And then we don't care about
order, so we don't care if flip

166
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,770
1 was a first head and flip two
was a second head or was

167
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,510
the other way around.

168
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,380
So we divide by 2, and we
said that this was the

169
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,900
same thing as 5 factorial.

170
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,570
Actually, let me do
it color coded.

171
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:31,130
This part is the same thing as
5 factorial over 3 factorial.

172
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,520
And then, that's actually the
same thing as 2 factorial

173
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,290
because 2 factorial
is 2 times 1.

174
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,890
So in general, let
me write this down.

175
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,540
The probability that x
equaled n-- and this is

176
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,820
for the x that I defined.

177
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,130
The random variable, the number
of heads I get in 5 flips of

178
00:08:50,130 --> 00:09:02,100
the coin-- it was equal to 5
factorial divided

179
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,430
by n factorial.

180
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,050
In this case it was 2, 2 was n.

181
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,730
We said was the probability
that we get exactly 2 heads.

182
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,430
Times 5 minus 2 factorial.

183
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,990
And I encourage you to review
because it really is important

184
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,400
to get an intuitive
feel of this.

185
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,890
I encourage you to review
the videos I made in the

186
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,680
probability playlist on
binomial coefficients, and on

187
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,720
this flipping of coins type of
probability problems because I

188
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,140
go a little more in detail in
the actual intuition of this.

189
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,580
But if you watch those or if
you have a little bit of

190
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,490
experience with this, you
would recognize that this is

191
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,980
the binomial coefficient.

192
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,340
And actually, I even have a
video why it's called the

193
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,830
binomial because these
coefficients show up when you

194
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,380
actually multiply binomials.

195
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,600
Binomials are just things like
if I just have x plus why and I

196
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,450
start multiplying it by itself,
take it to different powers,

197
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,380
the coefficients of these tend
to be-- well, they are

198
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,080
the same as these.

199
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,270
And I give you a whole
video on why that-- well,

200
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,420
that's why that works.

201
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,180
And so this is why
it's even called the

202
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,990
binomial coefficient.

203
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,210
And why this is called the
binomial distribution.

204
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,060
But another way of writing
this, the shorthand

205
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,250
is 5 choose n.

206
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,340
And they say that because
what were we doing?

207
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,810
We said we had 5 flips and
we were choosing 2 of

208
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,510
the flips to be heads.

209
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,830
Or, in this case, we have 5
flips and we're choosing n

210
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,870
of the flips to be heads.

211
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,110
So this will tell you how many
of the different permutations

212
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,820
satisfy our condition.

213
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,570
And then we say, well,
what's the probability

214
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,230
of each of those?

215
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,020
It's times 1 out of 32.

216
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,340
So this is why it's called
a binomial distribution.

217
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,790
Each of the values of
probabilities for each of the

218
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,720
random variable values-- you
can figure them out by using

219
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,200
your binomial coefficients.

220
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,420
Anyway, I just realized
I'm out of time again.

221
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,340
And don't worry, I'm going to
do a couple of more examples

222
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,690
with this because I really want
you to get the hang of the

223
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,330
binomial distribution before we
move into the normal

224
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:01,980
distribution.

225
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,631
See you soon.
