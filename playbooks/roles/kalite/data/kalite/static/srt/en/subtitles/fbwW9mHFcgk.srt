1
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:05,475
STEVEN: We're in the Louvre,

2
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:11,532
and we are looking at the monumental cycle by Peter Paul Rubens of Marie de Medici.

3
00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:17,949
There are 24 canvases that were painted by Rubens over a four year period with the help of his workshop.

4
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:20,475
Now according to the contract, he had to paint all the figures

5
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:24,181
but his assistants could certainly paint in much of the rest.

6
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:29,199
This is a major commision by one of the most powerful women in Europe at this time,

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,836
if not the most powerful woman.

8
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:33,117
Her father was the Duke of Tuscany,

9
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,342
and her husband was Henry IV, King of France.

10
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:39,846
This cycle is a commemoration of the major events of her life.

11
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:41,748
Although, I have to come out and say it,

12
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:44,652
it is absurd in its grandeur.

13
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:46,904
It is completey over the top.

14
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:50,406
This is the woman who had some significant events in her life,

15
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:53,310
but certainly was extremely wealthy and extremely powerful.

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:01:00,152
Nevertheless, Rubens clearly had to struggle and bring in every mythological stage prop that he could

17
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:05,974
in order to complete a cycle that was, we can only say, dedicated to her ego.

18
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:09,948
In reality, she had an interesting and problematic life.

19
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:15,615
There were quite a number of scandals, and not least of which was when her son, who would be Louis XIII.

20
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:20,947
He was too young to take the throne, and so she was in control of France as regent.

21
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:26,713
But then when he finally came to age, she continued to reign. She wouldn't let him to ascend to the throne

22
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:31,052
and when he was finally old enough and had the authority to be able to say, "No, it's my turn,"

23
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:35,307
he actually banished her from France and he wouldn't allow her to came back for years.

24
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:37,075
BETH: And you get the sense of why,

25
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:41,144
because she was obviously very ambitous, very powerful

26
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:45,370
and it might have been hard to rule in her presence

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,281
STEVEN: In her shadow.

28
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:50,782
Let's take a look at the ninth painting in this series of 24.

29
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:54,309
It is when she is coming to France from Italy.

30
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:56,911
It's called the "The Disembarkation at Marseilles,"

31
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:03,198
and, you know, to get off a ship is not usually not seen as a particularly triumphant moment,

32
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:09,409
but Rubens is able to make this seem as if it, itself, is a triumphant moment.

33
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:10,780
BETH: Right, she is the queen,

34
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,081
Victory above her with trumpts announcing her arrival.

35
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:17,217
STEVEN: That's right. Not just one, but two trumpets.

36
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:22,541
BETH: This is the beginning of her fulfillment of her destiny as Queen of France.

37
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:26,009
STEVEN: And we see France personified by a figure

38
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:28,412
that seems to be preparing to kneel before her

39
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:31,648
wearing a blue cape of gold fleur de lys.

40
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:34,654
BETH: Which is the symbol of the royal family of France

41
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,241
STEVEN: Behind her is a Knight of Malta that looks on.

42
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,366
This fabulous ship, just heavily wrought.

43
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:45,698
This sky, in the most baroque fashion is just swirling and full of energy,

44
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:49,285
but that's nothing with compared to what goes on below the gangplank.

45
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:54,308
BETH: That's right. We have three nereids or sea nymphs below her

46
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:58,781
along with the gods of the sea, writhe and turn.

47
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:01,215
STEVEN: Almost as if they are the the sea themselves.

48
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,531
It's as if their bodies are waves.

49
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:06,403
There's this just tremendous energy and real beauty.

50
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:10,243
I mean, look at the colors and the understanding of the torsion of the body.

51
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:14,979
BETH: The drama of their poses contrast with the stateliness

52
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,949
and the grandeur of Marie de Medici above.

53
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,816
STEVEN: You'll noticed that they are actually assisting

54
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:24,116
by holding the ship fast to the land so that she can walk easily.

55
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:28,281
BETH: They enabled the pagan gods and goddesses, and figures of victory,

56
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:32,865
are all there at the service of Marie de Medici's destiny as Queen

57
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:35,615
And it's strange, she's a little bit set back

58
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:41,307
compared to the sea nymphs who really occupy more than a third of the canvas.

59
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:45,115
STEVEN: Okay, so I think we've made the point that it's completely over the top,

60
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:47,881
but let's get really close and take a look at the paint. BETH: Okay

61
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:53,782
STEVEN: So the painting is hung in such a way that it starts about four feet off the floor,

62
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,475
so that we only really look up at the sea gods and nereids.

63
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:59,811
In Rubens's characteristic handling of paint,

64
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:02,447
there is just a tremendous sense of motion and energy.

65
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:05,949
I am really struck by the beard and the grey hair

66
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,585
of the sea god in the foreground.

67
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:09,404
If you look directly under him

68
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,409
you can see what look like a raw strokes of paint.

69
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,614
There's a kind of energy a kind of facility that Rubens has.

70
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:17,880
And then look at the coloration of the nereids.

71
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,054
They are full of pinks and yellows and greens and blues.

72
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,638
BETH: and look at all the foreshortening that is going on.

73
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:29,030
There's a post that one of the Nereids is holding onto

74
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,481
and tying a rope around that's moving into our space.

75
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,865
That sea god that you talked about a moment ago

76
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:37,819
reaches his hand back into space.

77
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,738
Everything in the bottom of this canvas is in motion.

78
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:45,177
STEVEN: I am particularly taken by the way in which their eyes are absoulutely alive

79
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:48,615
with specks of white paint which become this beautiful reflective surface.

80
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:51,615
You also see that in the pearls in the hair of the women,

81
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:55,271
and then you see it in the drips of water that come off their body.

82
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:59,309
Now these 24 canvases were, of course, not originally arrayed in the Louvre.

83
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:02,115
They were in the Palace of the Luxembourg Gardens,

84
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:07,447
which was, in fact, Marie de Medici's own palace and that was built to remind her of Florence.

85
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:10,672
BETH: It's really fun to go from one to the other

86
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:15,343
and read the story of these great moments of her life.
