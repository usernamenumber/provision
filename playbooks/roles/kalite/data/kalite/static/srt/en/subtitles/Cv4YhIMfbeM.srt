1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,070
We'll now learn an application
of combinations that you

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,570
probably won't find
intuitive at first.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,000
But the more you think about
it, it will make a lot of sense

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,820
and hopefully it'll make you
appreciate, once again, the

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,140
beauty of mathematics.

7
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,850
And then you'll also know why--
when we say n choose k in

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,290
combinations --why that's also
called a binomial coefficient.

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,480
Because we are going to
cover the binomial theorem.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,430
So before I give you the
binomial theorem, let's

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,970
understand the motivation for
why it's even interesting.

12
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,150
So let me erase that.

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,110
Invert colors.

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,660
So if we just had to
multiply-- I don't know.

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,530
Well let's just take different
powers of a binomial.

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,350
A binomial is just a polynomial
with two terms, right?

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,000
So a plus b-- Well a
plus b to the 0, that's

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,060
equal to 1, right?

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,710
Anything to the 0
is equal to 1.

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:59,110
a plus b to the 1, well
that equals a plus b.

21
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:05,550
a plus b squared, that equals--
and if you don't have a lot of

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,310
practice doing this you
might be tempted to say a

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,080
squared plus b squared.

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,530
But you should correct yourself
quickly and slap yourself on

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,600
the wrist or the brain or
someplace if you did that.

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,390
Because that's a plus
b times a plus b.

27
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,400
And then we could use the
distributive property, or,

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,410
if you learned it this way
in Algebra I, you could

29
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,940
use the FOIL property.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,000
That equals a times
a plus b, right?

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,360
Plus b times a plus b.

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:42,690
Which is equal to a squared
plus ab plus ba plus b squared.

33
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:48,980
Which is equal to a squared
plus 2ab plus b squared.

34
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,200
That should be a bit
of review for you.

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,590
And now it gets a little
bit more interesting.

36
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,810
What is-- Let me circle that
just so we remember it.

37
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,590
That's a plus b squared.

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,440
What's a plus b to the third?

39
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,120
   

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,130
And now this is starting
to get complicated.

41
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:16,730
This is equal to a plus b times
a plus b times a plus b.

42
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,450
Or another way to view it,
it's a plus b squared

43
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,110
times a plus b, right?

44
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,700
This is a power of three.

45
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,500
So this was a plus b squared.

46
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,900
So if we multiply it by
a plus b, we'll get a

47
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,510
plus b to the third.

48
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:28,960
So let's do that.

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,460
Let's multiply this
times a plus b.

50
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,690
   

51
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,480
So first let's multiply
everything times b.

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,680
So that's b-- let me do
this in another color.

53
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,840
a squared b, right?

54
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,590
That's a squared times b.

55
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,400
Now let's do 2ab times b.

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,600
So plus 2ab squared, right?

57
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,970
2ab times b.

58
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,970
And then plus b cubed.

59
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,910
And then we have a times a.

60
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,210
Well that's a cubed, right?

61
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,780
None of these match that, so
I'll put it in another column.

62
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,690
a times 2ab.

63
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,830
Well that's 2a squared b.

64
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,070
   

65
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,650
I'll put that out
here: 2a squared b.

66
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,070
And then a times b squared.

67
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,470
Well that's plus ab
squared, right?

68
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,010
And now we'll just add
up all of the terms.

69
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,700
All we do is the distributive
property again, right?

70
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,780
We multiplied a times all of
these terms and then added that

71
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,740
to b times all of these terms.

72
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,490
If we add it all up-- I'll
try to do it in order

73
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,330
of-- Let's see.

74
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,630
Let's put the a cubed first.

75
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,850
   

76
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,200
And then-- Well actually we
already had this thing.

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,440
This 2a squared b, I could
have written it here.

78
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,870
2a squared b, because I had
an a squared b here so.

79
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,090
I just rewrote the
2a squared b here.

80
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,040
So we have a cubed plus 2a
squared b plus a squared b.

81
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,960
That's 3a squared b.

82
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,760
And then 2ab squared
plus ab squared.

83
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,720
That's 2ab squared.

84
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,860
And then plus b cubed.

85
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,380
As you can see, that involved
a lot just to take something

86
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,640
to the third power.

87
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,810
So we could-- If we had the
time, we could figure out what

88
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,690
a plus b to the fourth power is
or what a plus b to

89
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,610
the tenth power is.

90
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,190
But as you could imagine,
this would take you all day.

91
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,940
So wouldn't it be neat if there
were an easy way to calculate

92
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,950
what a binomial is to
an arbitrary power?

93
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,370
And that's where the binomial
theorem comes into play.

94
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,900
And in this video I'm going
to show you what the

95
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,190
binomial theorem is.

96
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,470
I will show you
how to apply it.

97
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,480
I will show you a trick or
a technique that will make

98
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,240
you seem like a genius.

99
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,770
And then in the next video
I'll hopefully give you

100
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,380
some intuition for why the
binomial theorem actually

101
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,000
involves combinations.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,220
Why it involves actually the
binomial coefficient at all.

103
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,770
So what is the
binomial theorem?

104
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,510
Let me erase all of this.

105
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,080
And you can confirm that the
binomial theorem works for the

106
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,950
ones that we've worked out,
up to a plus b to the third.

107
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,360
You could work out a plus
b to the fourth if you

108
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,330
like to punish yourself.

109
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,980
Let's see.

110
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,190
Clear image.

111
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,050
Invert color.

112
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:24,660
So the binomial theorem tells
us that a plus b to the nth

113
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,080
power is equal to-- And I know
it's going to look complicated

114
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,100
at first, but we'll do a couple
of examples and you'll see

115
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,780
it's not that intimidating.

116
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:39,300
It equals the sum from k
equals 0 to n, right?

117
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,610
This n is the same
thing as that n.

118
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,550
Of-- each term is n
choose k, right?

119
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,650
We're going to keep
incrementing k up from 0 to

120
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:58,080
n-- of x to the n minus
k times y to the k.

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,020
I know that looks complicated
but if we do a couple of

122
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,300
concrete examples, I think it
should make a reasonable

123
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,540
amount of sense.

124
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,140
So given-- Oh sorry.

125
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,660
This is-- This isn't-- I
was copying this down.

126
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,660
This should be a to the n
minus k and this should be b.

127
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,500
What I had written down
before, that would be

128
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,820
x plus y to the n.

129
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,210
If we have a plus b to the n, n
choose k each term. a to the

130
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,900
n minus k times b to the k.

131
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,480
So let's apply this, a couple
of concrete examples.

132
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,640
We could even switch around the
variable names if we want just

133
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,310
to show you that they don't
have to be a's and b's.

134
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,660
They can be anything.

135
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:41,170
So what is a plus b-- let's do
one that we otherwise would

136
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:46,230
have found fairly difficult-- a
plus b to the fourth power.

137
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,760
Well that, the binomial theorem
tells us that, let's see, the

138
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,070
first term is going to be--
Well what's n, first of

139
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,620
all? n is 4 in this case.

140
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,220
It equals-- Let me fill in
all the numbers actually.

141
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:04,500
From k equals 0 to 4
of 4 choose k, right?

142
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,000
Because k is what
we're incrementing.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,960
a to the 4 minus k.

144
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,920
b to the k, right?

145
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,260
I just substituted the
n into the binomial

146
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,820
theorem definition.

147
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,780
And what does that equal?

148
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,360
Well the first term
is k equals 0.

149
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,010
So that's 4 choose 0.

150
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,630
So out of 4 things, I'm
going to choose 0.

151
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,260
And I'll show you in the
next video why that works.

152
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,470
Of a to the 4 minus k.

153
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,800
Well the first term k is 0.

154
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,250
So it's a to the fourth,
b to the 0, right?

155
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,020
So the b, that's just 1,
so we can just ignore it.

156
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,550
So what's the next term?

157
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, it's going
to be 4 choose 1.

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,330
And now k is 1.

159
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,740
So 4 minus 1 is 3.

160
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,260
a to the third.

161
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,510
And k is 1 now.

162
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,370
We're in the-- This
is the zeroth term.

163
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,870
This is the first term.

164
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,830
So b to the first plus-- So as
you can see, each term we go,

165
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,630
the a term, the first term,
whichever it is, it decrements.

166
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,840
It starts up at the power
n, or in the fourth power.

167
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,850
And then each term,
it goes down by 1.

168
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,520
And then the second term,
the b term, it starts

169
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,660
at the zeroth power.

170
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
So it starts at 1.

171
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,010
That's why you don't
see it there.

172
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,620
And then each term
it increments up.

173
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,520
So then the next one-- So I
think you see the pattern.

174
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:29,820
It's going to be 4 choose 2, a
squared b squared plus 4 choose

175
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:38,910
3 ab to the third
plus 4 choose 4.

176
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,620
Now it'll have a to the
zero, so that's just

177
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,690
1, b to the fourth.

178
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,770
So we're done if we just figure
out what these binomial

179
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,830
coefficients are.

180
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,940
And that's where they
come from, from the

181
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,720
binomial theorem.

182
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,910
But we remember how to
calculate that, right?

183
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,020
In general-- and hopefully you
have the intuition on this.

184
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,960
You shouldn't just memorize it.

185
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,970
n choose k from our
combinatorics is equal to n

186
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,710
factorial over k factorial
divided by n minus k factorial.

187
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,940
   

188
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,930
So in this case,
what's 4 choose 0?

189
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,240
That equals-- I know it seems
very time consuming right now.

190
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,570
Although it's less time
consuming than actually

191
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,360
multiplying it out.

192
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,210
But I'll show you trick in a
second that will amaze you.

193
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:30,480
So this is equal to 4 factorial
over 0 factorial times 4

194
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,400
factorial, right-- 4 minus 0 is
4 --a to the fourth plus 4

195
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:45,680
factorial over 1 factorial
times 3 factorial, right?

196
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,600
4 minus 1 is 3 factorial.

197
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,870
a to the third b plus-- I know
this is getting a little

198
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,180
tedious, but I think it's good
to completely work through

199
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,770
one entire problem
--plus 4 choose 2.

200
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,680
That's 4 factorial over
2 factorial times 2

201
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,410
factorial, right?

202
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,560
4 minus 2 is 2.

203
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,570
a squared b squared
plus 4 choose 3.

204
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,690
That's 4 factorial
over 3 factorial.

205
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,090
4 minus 3 is 1 factorial.

206
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,890
   

207
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,120
ab cubed.

208
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,200
And then 4 choose 4.

209
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,470
That's plus 4 factorial
over 4 factorial times 0

210
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,600
factorial b to the fourth.

211
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,730
And notice: this coefficient is
the same as that coefficient.

212
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,370
This coeffieicnt is the same
as this coefficient and then

213
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,600
this one's in the middle.

214
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,890
So let's evaluate them.

215
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,240
And I'll switch colors.

216
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,120
So 0 factorial, in case
you don't know it, it's

217
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,410
actually defined to be 1.

218
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,480
Which is a little bit
non-intuitive because 1

219
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,240
factorial is also 1.

220
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,430
But that's just something
you should know.

221
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,830
So 4 factorial divided by 0
factorial times 4 factorial.

222
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,050
This is actually equal to 1.

223
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,940
So the first term is just a to
the fourth plus 4 factorial--

224
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,430
it's 4 times 3 times 2 times 1
--divided by 3 times 2 times 1.

225
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,380
So that equals 4.

226
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,820
4a cubed b plus 4 factorial.

227
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,580
That's 4 times 3
times 2 times 1.

228
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,340
So that's 24, right?

229
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,610
Over-- what's 2 factorial?

230
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,260
That's just 2.

231
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,420
So 2 times 2 is 4.

232
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,170
So 24 divided by 4 is 6.

233
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:32,600
So 6a squared b squared plus
well 4-- This term is the

234
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,820
same as this term, right?

235
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,660
With just the 1 factorial
and the 3 factorial

236
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,430
got switched around.

237
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,340
And you might want to think
about that for a few

238
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,530
seconds as to why that is.

239
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,250
It should make a
little sense to you.

240
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:48,030
But that is-- So it's
going to be 4ab cubed.

241
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,030
And it makes sense, right?

242
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,610
Because this could have
just been b plus a.

243
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,960
A plus b and b plus a are the
same thing so it makes sense

244
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,280
that there's a symmetry, right?

245
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,240
That we have 4ab cubed and
we also have 4a cubed b.

246
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,730
Ignore me if you find
that confusing.

247
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,220
If you find it enlightening,
all the better.

248
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,650
And then the last term.

249
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,550
4 factorial.

250
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,460
This term is the same
thing as this term.

251
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,760
And we've already figured
out that equals 1.

252
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,540
So plus b to the fourth.

253
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,410
So I had a little symmetry.

254
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,680
The coefficients
are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1.

255
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,670
And I'll show you in a future
video that these are actually

256
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,560
the terms of a Pascal Triangle,
which is another avenue

257
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,140
to go in mathematics.

258
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,180
But anyway, this was
an application of the

259
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,100
binomial theorem.

260
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,040
And I realize I've taken
12 minutes so far.

261
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,990
So I will do more examples
in the next video.

262
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,492
See you soon.

263
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:36,900
