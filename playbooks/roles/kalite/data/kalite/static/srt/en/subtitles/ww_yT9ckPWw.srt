1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,300
Let's find the equation for
the regression line

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,470
that best fits this.

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,440
Where the fit minimizes the
squared distance to each of

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,210
the points.

6
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,870
And then let's actually
calculate how good of a fit it

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,880
is using an r squared.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,210
And we might have to do that
in the next video,

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,360
depending on time.

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,700
So just as a reminder, the
line is going to have the

11
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,870
equation y is equal mx plus b.

12
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,840
And we've shown ourselves that
the slope of this line-- the

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,470
one that best minimizes the
squared distance to each of

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,320
those points-- is going to be
the mean of the xy's minus the

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,120
mean of x times the mean of y.

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,250
All of that over the mean of the
x's squared, or the mean

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:51,700
of the x squareds, minus the
means of the x's squared.

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,070
So one way to memorize it, I
guess, is the first terms have

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,440
the mean of the combined
things.

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,860
You're multiplying x times
itself first, then meaning.

21
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,330
You're multiplying x
times y, times each

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,390
other first, then meaning.

23
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,310
And then the second terms,
you're finding the means of

24
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,760
the individual components
and then multiplying.

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,630
Mean of x, times mean of y,
mean of x times mean of x.

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,850
So hopefully maybe that helps.

27
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,770
Maybe it doesn't.

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,510
But we can calculate
the slope.

29
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,300
And then the y intercept, b, is
just going to be equal to

30
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,130
the mean of y times whatever we
calculate here for m, times

31
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:27,850
the mean of x.

32
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,370
And we can do that because we
know that the point mean of x

33
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,470
comma mean of y is going to be
on this regression live.

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,150
So what's calculate them.

35
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,340
And you'll see, in the last
example we did three points.

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,280
We only have four points here.

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,990
But the computations get
more and more intense.

38
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,010
You can imagine what would
happen if you had 10 or 20 or

39
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,660
100 points.

40
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,690
You pretty much have to use a
calculator at that point.

41
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,030
Or computer, even better.

42
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,530
Or a spreadsheet.

43
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,050
So let's calculate m.

44
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,740
And to do that, let's calculate
the components.

45
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,840
So the mean of x-- the mean of
the x's-- is going to be equal

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:13,520
to, this x is negative 2, plus
negative 1, plus 1, plus 4.

47
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,550
All of that over, we have
four x data points.

48
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,660
These two guys cancel out.

49
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,930
Negative 2 plus 4 is 2.

50
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,250
2 over 4 is equal to 1/2.

51
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,965
Now let's do the mean
of the y's.

52
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:26,480
   

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,600
We have negative 3, we
have a negative 1.

54
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,460
And then we have a 2, and
then we have a 3.

55
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,300
And once again, we have
four data points.

56
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,860
That guy and that
guy cancel out.

57
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,390
Negative 1 plus 2 is 1.

58
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,460
So this is equal to 1/4.

59
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,210
Now let's figure out the
mean of the xy's.

60
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,020
So x times y, the
mean of that.

61
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,760
So over here we have negative
2 times negative 3.

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,040
Negative 2 times negative
3 is positive 6.

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,120
Plus negative 1 times negative
1 is positive 1.

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,440
Plus 1 times 2 is 2.

65
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,860
Plus 4 times 3 is 12.

66
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,690
And we have four of
these points.

67
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,480
And what is this?

68
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,890
This is 6 plus 1 is 7.

69
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,980
7 plus 2 is 9.

70
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,880
9 plus 12 is 21 over 4.

71
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:36,550
This is equal to 21/4.

72
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,360
And then finally, we want-- I'll
do this in a new color--

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,400
the mean of the x's squared.

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,790
And so that is going to be equal
to-- negative 2 squared

75
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,510
is positive 4.

76
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,280
Plus negative 1 squared
is positive 1.

77
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,830
Plus 1 squared is 1.

78
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,980
Plus for 4 squared is 16.

79
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,640
All of that over 4.

80
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,710
4 plus 2 is 6 plus
16 is 22 over 4.

81
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:15,200
So 22/4 is the same
thing as 11/2.

82
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,610
So now we're now ready to
calculate the actual slope.

83
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,190
Let me do it over here.

84
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,970
Well actually, let me
do it over here.

85
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,910
I want to be able look at
everything we've done.

86
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,470
   

87
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,595
So this is going to be equal to,
in this case, it's going

88
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:36,280
to be the mean of the
xy's, which is 21/4.

89
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:47,200
Minus the product of the mean
of x, which is 1/2.

90
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,500
Times the mean of the
y's, which is 1/4.

91
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,260
   

92
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,440
And then all of that over
the mean of the x

93
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:04,200
squareds, which is 11/2.

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,840
So we did that.

95
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,270
Minus the mean of
the x's squared.

96
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,960
The mean of the x's,
once again, is 1/2.

97
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,680
   

98
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,200
And so what is this equal to?

99
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm just going to go straight
to the calculator.

100
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,250
I could deal with the fractions,
but this isn't a

101
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,980
review of adding
and subtracting

102
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,060
and multiplying fractions.

103
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,400
Let's just go straight
to the calculator.

104
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,100
Actually, let me simplify
it before.

105
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,380
It's just too tempting
to simplify.

106
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,630
Let me copy and paste it.

107
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:39,720
   

108
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,090
Let's go down here
to calculate it.

109
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,840
And so this is going to be--
maybe I should have used the

110
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,930
calculator, but it's
too tempting.

111
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,930
So what's this on top?

112
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,440
On top, we have 21/4 minus 1/2
times 1/4 is minus 1/8.

113
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,250
All of that over 11/2 minus
1/2 squared, which is 1/4.

114
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,270
Now, one way to simplify this
right from the get go is

115
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,320
multiply the numerator and
the denominator by 8.

116
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,410
And that's just to get rid
of all these fractions.

117
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:16,150
So 21/4 times 8 is going to be
the same thing is 21 times 2,

118
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,380
which is equal to 42.

119
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,570
Minus 1/8 times 8.

120
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,670
We have to, of course,
distribute the eights.

121
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,340
So it's going to be minus 1.

122
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,360
All of that over, 8 times 11/2
is going to be 11 times 4,

123
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,870
which is 44.

124
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,620
And then 8 times 1/4 is
2, so it's minus 2.

125
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,690
So 42 minus 1 is 41.

126
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,000
And then 44 minus 2 is 42.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,130
So the slope is 41/42.

128
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,850
So a little bit less than
a slope of one.

129
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,740
42/42 would be exactly 1.

130
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,260
So our regression slope is
a little bit less than 1.

131
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:04,840
And then our regression
y-intercept, b, is going to be

132
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,330
equal to the mean of the y.

133
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:17,660
So 1/4, minus our slope, minus
41/42, times the mean of the

134
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:24,260
x's, so times 1/2.

135
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:35,070
And so this is going to be
equal to 1/4 minus 41/84,

136
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,170
which is equal to-- let
me just find a common

137
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:39,670
denominator.

138
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,050
So let's go over 84.

139
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,460
So what's 1/4 of 84?

140
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,360
1/4 of 80 is 20.

141
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,070
So this is 21.

142
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,210
21 times 4 is 84.

143
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,400
This is 1/4 of 84.

144
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,520
Yep, that's right.

145
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,790
So it's going to be 21 minus 41
over 84, which is equal to

146
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,360
negative 20.

147
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,510
Negative 20 over 84, which is
the same thing, they're both

148
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,280
divisible by 4, the numerator
divided by 4 is

149
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,310
negative 5, over 21.

150
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,800
So our regression line is going
to be y is equal to

151
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,460
41/42 x minus 5/21.

152
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,930
And 5/21 is a little
bit less than 1/4.

153
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,720
5/20 would be 1/4.

154
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,980
We made the denominator a little
bit bigger, so it's

155
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,630
going to be a little bit
less than negative 1/4.

156
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,980
So our y-intercept is going to
be a little bit less than

157
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,650
negative 1/4.

158
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,169
And then we're going to
have a slope a little

159
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,145
bit less than 1.

160
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:46,340
So our line is going to look
something like this.

161
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,870
   

162
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,730
If I were able to actually draw
a straight line, it would

163
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,880
look something like
that over there.

164
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,250
So I'm going to leave you
there in this video.

165
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,920
In the next video, we're
actually going to calculate

166
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,250
the r squared for this line.

167
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,840
How good of a fit is it?

168
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,940
How much of the total variation
in the y values can

169
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,340
be explained by the variation
in the x values, or by the

170
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,990
line itself?

171
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,399
