1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,530
When we learned about antigen
presenting cells, we learned

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,130
that they can first digest
something-- let me draw a

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,700
dendritic cell right here--
my best version

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,450
of a dendritic cell.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,120
Maybe I should draw them
simpler than that.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,990
A dendritic cell is a phagocyte
and it is an antigen

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,860
presenting cell.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,630
So after phagocytoses some type
of a pathogen, it'll cut

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,550
it all up, and then it'll
display-- it'll present the

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:35,990
antigen on its surface on a
protein complex here and the

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,380
part of the pathogen that
it cut up, it'll

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,040
put up right here.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,000
And we learned on the antigen
presenting cell video that

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,570
this complex right here was an
MHC type II complex, where MHC

15
00:00:49,570 --> 00:01:02,750
stands for major
histocompatibility complex.

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,800
Where histocompatibility just
means tissue compatibility.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,980
And this was the case on antigen
presenting cells.

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,550
So even B cells did this.

19
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,390
Let me draw a B cell.

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,900
So a B cell-- it has
its membrane bound

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,770
antibody, just like that.

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,220
It actually has many, many
thousands of these.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,130
I could keep drawing a bunch of
them, but just so you know

24
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,700
there's more than one.

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,560
Maybe one of these get triggered
or get attached to

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,730
some type of virus or protein
or bacteria floating around.

27
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,340
And what it'll do is it'll take
this in and cut it up

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,760
again and do the same thing as
what the dendritic cell did.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:56,620
It'll cut up a part of this and
present it on its surface

30
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,170
in conjunction with
an MHC II complex.

31
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,320
So once again, this is
an MHC II complex.

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,680
So these professional antigen
presenting cells that go out

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,460
and take things out of the
fluid, out of the humoral

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,190
parts of our body, things
just floating around.

35
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,860
They'll take them in, they'll
say, this is bad, cut them up,

36
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,770
and then present them
on these MHC II.

37
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,010
That's why we call them
professional antigen

38
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,480
presenting cells.

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:35,530
Now, it turns out that pretty
much all cells in our bodies--

40
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,070
when I say almost all
cells, it's actually

41
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,480
all nucleated cells.

42
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,190
So all cells that have a nucleus
in the human body-- so

43
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,370
the only cells in our human body
that don't have nucleuses

44
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,600
are red blood cells, which I
find fascinating-- so that

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,310
they can have more space
for storing hemoglobin.

46
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,040
But all nucleated cells in our
bodies have another major

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:05,650
histocompatibility complex on it
and it's called an MHC I--

48
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,530
major histocompatibility
type I.

49
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,770
And just so you know, these
are also nucleated cells.

50
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,000
So they're also going to have an
MHC type I complex on them

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,240
right here.

52
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,040
Now the interesting thing about
the MHC type I complex

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:30,950
is because it's on every cell in
our human body-- so pretty

54
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:36,010
much everything but the red
blood cells have an MHC I--

55
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,870
this is where if anything
wacky is going

56
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,910
on inside the cell.

57
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,260
Maybe the cell is cancerous and
producing crazy proteins.

58
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,130
Maybe it's been infected
with a virus.

59
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,430
Maybe some type of bacteria or
some type of weird protein has

60
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,080
gotten in here-- any cell in the
human body can cut those

61
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,460
up, even if it's malfunctioning,
and it will

62
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,090
present them.

63
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,930
So let's say the cell
is cancerous.

64
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,350
So this cell's cancerous and
it has all these wacky

65
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,140
proteins that only cancer cells
present that is not

66
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,740
normal for a normal cell--
that will be

67
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,140
presented on the MHC I.

68
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,220
Let's say that I have some other
cell in my body that's a

69
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,095
different type of cell.

70
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,370
It's nucleated.

71
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,865
Let's say it's been infected
with a virus.

72
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:23,390
So it's turning into
this virus factory.

73
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,980
Same thing-- there are
mechanisms in a cell that will

74
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,230
take some of the proteins that
make up those viruses and

75
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,245
present them on the
MHC I complex.

76
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,250
So in the case of MHC II, this
is what triggered helper T

77
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,130
cells to say, hey,
you know what?

78
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,160
I found something floating
out here.

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,930
Here's a little piece of
it, Mr. Helper T cell.

80
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,290
Why don't you bond to this and
raise the alarm system?

81
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,950
Now the MHC I system
says, this isn't

82
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,880
stuff floating around.

83
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,820
I've been infected.

84
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,850
I am cancerous.

85
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,950
I'm going nuts.

86
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,970
You better kill me.

87
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,280
I'm a virus, I'm a virus-making
machine.

88
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,370
You better kill me.

89
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,640
And that message goes to the
cytotoxic T cells and that's

90
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,710
really the topic
of this video.

91
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,920
So just to make sure
you understand the

92
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,250
difference-- so T cells.

93
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,390
They both have T cell receptors,
but the helper T

94
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,405
cells bond to MHC
II complexes.

95
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,680
Let's say that this is a helper
T cell right here.

96
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,640
It would want to-- not all
helper T cells will.

97
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,470
Only the ones that have the
right combination, the right

98
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,960
variable portion right here that
just perfectly bonds to

99
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,060
this combination of an antigen
and the MHC II complex-- this

100
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,210
type of helper T cell will bond
here, get activated, and

101
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,120
start differentiating.

102
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,650
And the effector versions of
them will start raising the

103
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,230
alarms and the memory versions
of them will stick around in

104
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,550
case this type of thing
needs to happen again.

105
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,160
With MHC I, instead of
attracting a helper T cell, it

106
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,175
will attract a cytotoxic
T cell.

107
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:10,450
   

108
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,930
So like helper T cells, the
T cell receptor has a

109
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:21,540
non-variable portion, but it
also has a variable portion

110
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,430
that is specific to this
combination of

111
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,300
antigen and MHC II.

112
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,400
So maybe this cytotoxic T cell
will be involved when this

113
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,995
cell goes cancerous.

114
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:41,680
This cytotoxic T cell would be
of no use-- or it won't bond

115
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,530
to this one that was attracted
to a virus.

116
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,360
It's going to have to be
another cytotoxic T

117
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,720
cell that does that.

118
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,700
And the mechanism where we get
this variability in the helper

119
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,970
T cells or the cytotoxic T
cells or you saw in the B

120
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,360
cells on their membrane bound
antibodies, that all comes

121
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,750
from when-- in their development
stage or in the

122
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,980
maturation process, the DNA that
codes for these variable

123
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,310
portions gets shuffled
around intentionally.

124
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,160
So normally, we're always
trying to preserve DNA

125
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,700
information, here it gets
shuffled around.

126
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,800
But anyway, once a cytotoxic T
cell finds one of these guys

127
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,630
on an MHC I-- remember, every
nucleated cell in the body has

128
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,080
an MHC I-- then what it does
is, it gets activated.

129
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,270
So let's say this guy says,
hey, that looks shady.

130
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,050
You need to die.

131
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,780
So this guy gets activated and
just like all other activated

132
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,986
cells, he starts to divide and
divide and divide and divide

133
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,010
and differentiate.

134
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,930
And he divides and he
differentiates into memory,

135
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,420
just in case you're going to
need me again, just in case

136
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,580
this type of cancer
shows up again.

137
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,010
And then also into effector T
cells, which are the ones that

138
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,260
do the killing.

139
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,470
So this is an effector.

140
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,620
So let's say one of these
effectors-- they'll also bind

141
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,030
to cancerous molecules,
cancerous cells,

142
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,770
just like this one.

143
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,370
So let's say this cell has
split and there's another

144
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,490
version of it right here.

145
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,580
That's what cancer does.

146
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,880
It divides aggressively.

147
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,930
It's producing wacky proteins.

148
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,840
It presents the wacky proteins
on its MCH-- major

149
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,080
histocompatibility type I
complex-- it displays the

150
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,250
wacky proteins and then one of
these effector cytotoxic T

151
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:32,250
cells will be attracted
to it just like that.

152
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,520
And I'm not going into details
on what necessarily does the

153
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,630
attractions and all the membrane
bound proteins.

154
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,250
If you take an immunology
class,

155
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,289
you'll see more on that.

156
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,310
So this is a cytotoxic T cell
and it essentially forces this

157
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,790
cell to kill itself in a couple
of different ways.

158
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:53,610
One, it actually can exocytose
a bunch of proteins.

159
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,230
They're call perforins-- that
make little holes in the

160
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,090
membrane of the cell.

161
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,770
And it has other proteins that
it releases called granzymes

162
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,160
that go in here and essentially
start mechanisms

163
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
that make this cell want
to kill itself.

164
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,970
So the big picture is, if you
want to just take 20,000 feet,

165
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,860
B cells are very effective
at produces-- so when a B cell

166
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,200
gets activated, it produces
antibodies that kill things

167
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,640
that are floating
around, right?

168
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,210
Once a B cell gets activated, it
starts producing a bunch of

169
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,740
antibodies.

170
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,970
These antibodies float around
and then they can bond up to

171
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,600
viruses, make them ineffective,
or essentially

172
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,680
tag them for pickup from
macrophages or dendritic

173
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,900
cells, or other types of
phagocytes-- while cytotoxic T

174
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,360
cells-- these are used to
essentially kill cells that

175
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,390
have gone awry.

176
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,860
For example, a cancer cell
that's presenting weird

177
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,350
proteins or once the virus has
entered the cell, then the

178
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,850
antibodies are really
of no use.

179
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,880
The antibodies aren't
going to be able to

180
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,450
get into those cells.

181
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,270
In that case, instead of
cleaning up the virus itself,

182
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,020
a cytotoxic T cell will come
here and just kill this cell

183
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,300
because this cell is
a virus factory.

184
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,160
So you have to get it
out of the way.
