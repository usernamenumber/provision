1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:04,309
What I want to do in this video is review much of what we've already talked about.

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:09,688
And the hopefully build the intuition on why we divide by n-1

3
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:13,783
if we want to have an unbiased estimate of the population variance

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:17,091
when we're calculating the sample variance.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,711
So let's think about a population.

6
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:23,031
So let's say this is the population right over here.

7
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:25,011
And it is of size capital N.

8
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:30,145
And we also have a sample of that population.

9
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:34,144
And it's size is lower case n data points.

10
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:37,832
So let's talk about all the parameters and statistics

11
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:40,504
we know about so far.

12
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:45,557
So the first is the idea of the mean.

13
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:45,557
So if we're trying to calculate the mean for the population.

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,412
Is that going to be a parameter or a statistic?

15
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:57,283
Well, when we're trying to calculate it on the population

16
00:00:57,283 --> 00:01:01,632
we are calculating a parameter.

17
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:03,593
So let me right this down

18
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:09,034
So this is going to be, for the population

19
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:13,273
It is a parameter.

20
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:19,350
And when we calculate, when we attempt to calculate something for a sample

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,000
we would call that a statistic.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,873
So how do we think about the mean for a population?

23
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:30,131
Well, first of all, we denote it with the greek

24
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,984
letter miu.

25
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:36,179
And we essentially take every data point in our population.

26
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,939
So we take the sum of every data point.

27
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,701
We start at the first data point

28
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:42,308
and we go all the way to the capital Nth data point.

29
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:44,478
For every data point we add up.

30
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:46,347
So this is the ith data point:

31
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:49,537
so x sub 1 plus x sub 2 all the way to x sub capital N.

32
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:54,460
And then we divide by the total number of data points we have.

33
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,664
Well how do we calculate the sample mean.

34
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:01,993
Well for the sample mean we do a very similar thing but for the sample.

35
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:05,163
We denote it with an X with a bar over it.

36
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:10,193
And that's going to be taking every data point in the sample

37
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:12,550
so going up to lower case n

38
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,037
adding them up

39
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:16,234
the sum of all the data points in our sample

40
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:20,771
then dividing by the number of data points that we actually had.

41
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:25,158
The other thing that we're trying to calculate for the population

42
00:02:25,158 --> 00:02:27,121
which also was a parameter

43
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,421
then we're also going to calculate it for the sample

44
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:31,152
and estimate it for the population

45
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,591
was the variance.

46
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:35,390
Which was a measure of how dispersed or how

47
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,284
much the data points vary from the mean.

48
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,701
So let's write variance:

49
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:50,536
How do we denote and calculate variance for a population?

50
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:54,926
well for a population we'd say that the variance - we use the greek letter sigma squared -

51
00:02:54,926 --> 00:03:02,080
is equal to the squared distances from the population mean.

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,474
But what we do is we take

53
00:03:04,474 --> 00:03:05,957
for each data point

54
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:07,980
so i equal 1 all the way to N

55
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,794
we take that data point, subtract from it the population mean

56
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:13,511
so if you want to calculate this you'd want to

57
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,744
figure this out. Well that's one way to do it

58
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:17,090
we'll see there are other ways to do it

59
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,882
where you can kind of calculate them at the same time

60
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,432
but the easiest or the most intuitive is to calculate

61
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:24,904
this first, then for each of the data points take the data point

62
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:30,507
and subtract from that the mean, square it and then

63
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:34,404
divide by the total number of data points we have.

64
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:37,177
Now we get to the interesting part:

65
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,815
Sample variance.

66
00:03:38,815 --> 00:03:42,750
There's several ways, when people talk about the sample variance,

67
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,385
there's several tools in their toolkits, there's several ways to calculate it.

68
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:53,698
One way is the biased sample variance, the non unbiased estimator

69
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:57,004
of the population variance and that's denoted

70
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:00,840
usually by an S squared with subscript n

71
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,215
and what is the biased estimator?

72
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:06,053
How do we calculate it?

73
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:09,086
Well we would calculate it very similiar to how we would calculate it over here.

74
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:12,895
But we would do it for our sample not our population.

75
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:18,094
So for every data point in our sample, so we have n of them

76
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:25,268
we take that data point, from it we subtract our sample mean

77
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:29,371
square it and then divide by the number of data points that we have.

78
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:32,108
But we already talked about in the last video

79
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:38,678
how would we find, what is our best unbiased estimate of the population variance.

80
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,122
We're trying to find an unbiased estimate of the population variance.

81
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:44,653
Well in the last video we talked about

82
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,526
if we want to have an unbiased estimate and

83
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:49,522
here in this video I want to give you a sense, an intuition why

84
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:53,808
we would take the sum, so we're going to go through

85
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:57,363
every data point in our sample, we're going to take that data point

86
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:00,646
subtract the sample mean, square that, but

87
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:05,271
instead of dividing by n, we will divide by n minus 1.

88
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:11,040
We're dividing by a smaller number and

89
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,549
when you divide by a smaller number,

90
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:17,039
you're going to get a larger value.

91
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,733
So this is going to be larger

92
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:23,533
this is going to be smaller.

93
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:29,201
and this one we refer to as the unbiased estimate

94
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:33,681
and this one we refer to as the biased estimate.

95
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:38,726
if people just write this, they're talking about the sample variance

96
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:41,188
it's a good idea to clarify which one they're talking about

97
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:44,558
but if you had to guess and people would give you no further information

98
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:49,177
they're probably talking about the unbiased estimate.

99
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:51,358
So you'd probably divide by n minus 1.

100
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:56,139
But let's think about why this estimate will be

101
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,907
biased and why might want to have an estimate like this.

102
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:00,160
that is larger.

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,806
and maybe in the future we can have a computer program or something

104
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:05,619
that really makes us feel better that dividing by n-1 gives us

105
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:09,958
a better estimate of the true population variance.

106
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:14,568
so let's imagine all of the data in a population and I'm just going to plot them on

107
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:23,883
a number. All the data. So this is my number line. And let me plot all of the data points in my population.

108
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:32,123
So this is some data, this is some data, here is some data and here is some data here

109
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:34,758
and I can just do as many points as I want.

110
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:38,068
So these are just points on the number line. Now let's say I take

111
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:41,924
a sample of this. So this is my entire population, so let's

112
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:47,463
see, I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

113
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:50,541
so in this case what would be my big N?

114
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:54,572
my big N would be 14.

115
00:06:54,572 --> 00:07:01,121
Now let's say I take a sample. A lower case n of, let's say my sample size is 3.

116
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,775
I could take... before I even think about that, let's

117
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:09,528
think about roughly were the mean of this population would sit.

118
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:12,848
So the way I drew it, I'm not going to calculate it exactly, it looks like

119
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:17,109
the mean might sit someplace roughly right over here.

120
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:20,835
So the mean, the true population mean, the parameter is going to sit

121
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:24,605
right over here. Now let's think what happens when we sample

122
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:28,176
and I'm going to do just a very small sample size just to give us an intuition, but

123
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:32,347
this is true of any sample size. So let's say we have sample size of

124
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:34,494
3.

125
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:38,554
So there is some possibility that when we take our sample size of 3 that

126
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:44,704
we happen to sample in a way that our sample mean is pretty close to our population mean.

127
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:50,023
So e.g. if we sample that point, that point and that point I could imagine our sample mean

128
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:55,471
might actually sit pretty close to our population mean.

129
00:07:55,471 --> 00:08:01,542
But there's a distinct possibility that maybe when I take

130
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:05,479
a sample and I sample that, that and that and the key

131
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:12,535
idea here is that when you take a sample, your sample mean is always going to sit within your sample.

132
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:17,765
So there is a possibility that when you take your sample your mean could even be outside of the

133
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:21,469
sample and so in this situation and this is just to give you an intuition, so here

134
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:27,043
your sample mean is going to be sitting someplace in there.

135
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:30,029
And so if your were to just calculate the distance from

136
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:32,803
each of these points to the sample mean, so

137
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,017
this distance, that distance and you square it and

138
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:37,518
were to divide by the number of data points you have

139
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:44,585
this is going to be a much lower estimate than the true variance from the actual population mean.

140
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:47,376
Where these things are much, much, much further.

141
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:50,906
Now you're always not going to have the true population mean outside of your sample

142
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,024
but it's possible you do.

143
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:57,012
so in general this, if you just take your points,

144
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:59,809
find the squared distance to the sample mean, which

145
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,354
is always going to sit inside of your data, even though

146
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:05,192
the true population mean could be oustide of it, then

147
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:09,259
or it could be at on end of your data, however you might want to think about it

148
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:15,854
then your are likely to be underestimating the true population variance.

149
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:19,573
So this right over here is underestimate.

150
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:22,404
And it does turn out that if you just instead of

151
00:09:22,404 --> 00:09:24,336
dividing by n divide by n-1

152
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,864
you'll get a slightly larger sample variance

153
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:30,315
and this is an unbiased estiamte.

154
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,929
And in the next video and I might not get to in immediately

155
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:36,657
I would like to generate some type of computer program that is more convincing

156
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:40,408
that this is better estimate

157
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:44,000
of the population variance than this is.
