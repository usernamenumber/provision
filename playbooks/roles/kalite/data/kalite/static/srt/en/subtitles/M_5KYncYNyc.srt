1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
   

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,970
I'm now going to introduce
you to the notion of the

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,505
efficiency of an engine.

4
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:09,780
   

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,900
And it's represented by
the Greek letter eta.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,360
Even though it sounds like an
e, it looks like a kind of

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,820
funny-looking n.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,920
So Greek letter eta,
this is efficiency.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,060
And efficiency as applies to
engines is kind of similar to

10
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,940
the way we use the word
in our everyday life.

11
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,160
If I said, how efficient are
you with your time, I care

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,610
about, what are you doing with
that hour that I gave you?

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,520
Or if I said, how efficient are
you with your money, I'd

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,570
say, how much were you able to
buy with that $100 I gave you?

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,770
So efficiency with an engine
is the same thing.

16
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,360
What were you able to do with
the stuff that I gave you?

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,100
So in the engine world, we
define efficiency to be, the

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,470
work you did with the energy
that I gave you to do the

19
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,780
work, essentially.

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,860
And in our Carnot world, up
here, this is all the stuff

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,560
I'd done before, what was the
energy that I had given you?

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,710
Well, the energy that I'd given
you was the energy that

23
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,280
came from this first
reservoir up here.

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,690
Remember, when we were moving
the pebbles from A to B, we

25
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,730
were moving the pebbles to
keep it as a quasistatic

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,520
process, so that we can go back,
if we had to, and so

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,420
that the system stayed in
equilibrium the whole time.

28
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,980
If we didn't have this
reservoir here, the

29
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,970
temperature would have gone
down, because we're expanding

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,550
the volume, and all of that.

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,070
So we had to keep that
reservoir there.

32
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,580
The added heat to the system,
we figured out this multiple

33
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,540
times, was Q1.

34
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,250
It was equivalent to the work we
did over that time period,

35
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,210
so it would have been the whole
shaded region, not just

36
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,760
what's inside the circle.

37
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,460
But so the heat that
we gave you was Q1.

38
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,540
You later gave some heat
back, when some work

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,310
was done for you.

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,950
But what we care about is the
heat that we were given.

41
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,030
So in this case,
it would be Q1.

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,720
And what was the work
that you did?

43
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,320
Well, the net work that you
did was the shaded area.

44
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,160
It was the area inside
of our Carnot cycle.

45
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,240
So that's our definition
for efficiency.

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,630
It's always going to
be a fraction.

47
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,970
Sometimes it's given as a
percentage, where you just,

48
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,380
you know, this is 0.56.

49
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,500
You would call that
56% efficient.

50
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,800
Which is essentially saying, you
were able to transfer 56%

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,690
of the heat energy that you were
given, and turn that into

52
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,720
useful work.

53
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,320
And so it makes sense, at least
in my head, that that

54
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,020
would be the definition
for efficiency.

55
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,550
Now le'ts see if we can play
around with this, and see how

56
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,720
efficiency would play out with
some of the variables we're

57
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,720
dealing with in the
Carnot cycle.

58
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,310
So what was the work
that we did?

59
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,960
Well, we know our definition
of internal energy.

60
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,370
Our definition of internal
energy has been more useful

61
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,380
than you would have thought,
for such a simple equation.

62
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,840
Our change in internal energy is
the net heat applied to the

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,640
system minus the work
done by the system.

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,420
Right?

65
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,910
Now, when you complete one
Carnot cycle, when you go from

66
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,430
a all the way around back to a,
and actually, I'll make a

67
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,060
little aside here.

68
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,020
You could have actually
gone the other

69
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,910
way around the cycle.

70
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,090
But when you go the way we went
the first time, when you

71
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,980
go clockwise, you're
a Carnot engine.

72
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,330
You're doing work, and
you're transferring

73
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,940
heat from T1 to T2.

74
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,450
If you went the other way
around the circle,

75
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,430
essentially, you'd be a Carnot
refrigerator, where you would

76
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,080
have work being done to you,
and I'll touch on this in a

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,610
second, and you'd
be transferring

78
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,680
energy the other way.

79
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,690
And this will be important to
our proof of why the Carnot

80
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,980
engine is the best engine, at
least theoretically, from an

81
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,070
efficiency point of view.

82
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,510
If efficiency is all
you cared about.

83
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,080
But anyway.

84
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,110
That's what I was
talking about.

85
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,670
So if I go a complete cycle in
this PV diagram and I end up

86
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,260
back at A, what's my change
in internal energy?

87
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,280
It's 0.

88
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,360
My internal energy is a state
variable, so my change in

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,070
internal energy is 0.

90
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,570
My change in entropy
would also be 0.

91
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,160
It's another state variable,
when I get from A back to A.

92
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,950
So over the course of this
cycle, we know that my change

93
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,220
in internal energy is 0.

94
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,855
What's the net heat applied
to the system?

95
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:09,470
   

96
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:15,690
Well, we applied Q1 to the
system, and then we

97
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,720
took out Q2, right?

98
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,839
We gave that to the
second reservoir.

99
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,140
We gave that down there to T2,
to that second reservoir.

100
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,540
And then minus work-- and all
of this is equal to 0.

101
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,400
This is the net, i just want to
make it clear, this is the

102
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,210
net heat applied
to our system.

103
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,080
So the work done by the system--
we just add W to both

104
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,210
sides of this equation, you get
W is equal to Q1 minus Q2.

105
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:44,980
So there we have it.

106
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,440
Let's just substitute
that back here.

107
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,050
And instead of W, we can write
Q1 minus Q2 as the numerator

108
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,050
in our in our efficiency
definition, and then the

109
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,700
denominator is still Q1.

110
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,280
And we can do a little
bit of math.

111
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,090
This simplifies-- this is Q1.

112
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,890
This is the heat
we put into it.

113
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,040
So it's the net heat we applied
to the system divided

114
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,070
by the heat we put into it.

115
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,460
So this is equal to-- Q1
divided by Q1 is 1,

116
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,960
minus Q2 over Q1.

117
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,040
So once again, this is another
interesting definition of

118
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,590
efficiency.

119
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,730
They're all algebraic
manipulations using the

120
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,810
definition of internal energy,
and whatever else.

121
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,900
Now let's see if we can somehow
relate efficiency to

122
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,760
our temperatures.

123
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,240
Now, let me-- this is
Q1 right there.

124
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,920
So what were Q2 and Q1?

125
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,600
What were they?

126
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,420
What were their absolute values,
not looking at the

127
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,150
signs of them?

128
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,670
I mean, we know that Q2 was
transferred out of the system,

129
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,200
so if we said Q2 in terms of
the energy applied to the

130
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,360
system, it would be
a negative number.

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,320
But if we just wanted to know
the magnitude of Q2, what

132
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,240
would it be, and the
magnitude of Q1?

133
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,070
Well, the magnitude of Q1--
let me draw a new Carnot

134
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,730
cycle, just for cleanliness.

135
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,570
I'll draw a little small
one over here.

136
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,970
That's my volume axis.

137
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,360
That's my pressure axis.

138
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,790
PV.

139
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,170
I start here at some state, and
then I go isothermally.

140
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,410
What's a good color for an
isothermal expansion?

141
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,100
Maybe purple.

142
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,196
It's kind of-- let's see.

143
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:22,850
An isothermal expansion.

144
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,050
I'm on an isotherm here.

145
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,290
So I go down there, and I
go to state, and I went

146
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,300
down to state B.

147
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,910
So this is A to B.

148
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,750
And we know we are
an isotherm.

149
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,830
This is when Q1 was added.

150
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,910
This is an isotherm.

151
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,330
If your temperature didn't
change, your internal energy

152
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,200
didn't change.

153
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,110
And like I said before, if your
internal energy is 0,

154
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,970
then the heat applied to the
system is the same as

155
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,700
the work you did.

156
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,760
They cancel each other out.

157
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,880
That's why you got to 0.

158
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,220
So this Q1 that we apply to the
system, it must be equal

159
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,520
to the work we did.

160
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,270
And the work we did is just
the area under this curve.

161
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,810
We did this multiple times.

162
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,350
And why is it the area
under the curve?

163
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,120
Because it's a bunch
of rectangles of

164
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,770
pressure times volume.

165
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,320
And then you just add up all
the rectangles, an infinite

166
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,990
number of infinitely
narrow rectangles,

167
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,300
and you get the area.

168
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,540
And what is that?

169
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,970
Just a review-- pressure times
volume was the work, right?

170
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,100
Because we're expanding
the cylinder.

171
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,520
We're moving up that piston.

172
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,040
We're doing force
times distance.

173
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,050
So the amount Q1 is equal to
that integral-- the amount of

174
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,260
work we did as well-- is equal
to the integral from V final--

175
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,160
I shouldn't say V final.

176
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,980
from VB, from our volume
at B-- oh sorry.

177
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,400
From our volume at A
to our volume at B.

178
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,080
We're starting here, and we're
going to our volume at B.

179
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,010
And we're taking the integral
of pressure-- and I've done

180
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,490
this multiple times, but
I'll do it again.

181
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,080
So the pressure, our
height, times our

182
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,930
change in volume, dv.

183
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:06,270
We go back to our ideal gas
formula, PV is equal to nRT,

184
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,740
divide both sides by
V, and you get P is

185
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,050
equal to nRT over V.

186
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:20,190
And so you have Q1 is equal to
the integral of VA from VA to

187
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,560
VB of this little
thing over here.

188
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,750
nRT over V dv.

189
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,950
All of this stuff up here,
these are all constants.

190
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,210
Remember, we're an isotherm.

191
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,200
Our temperature isn't
changing.

192
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,260
We could write T1 there,
because that's our

193
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,950
temperature.

194
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,820
We're at T1.

195
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,770
We're on a T1 isotherm right
there, because we're touching

196
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,980
the T1 reservoir.

197
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,370
But this is all a constant,
so we can take

198
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,870
it out of the equation.

199
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,130
And then we've evaluated this
multiple times, so I won't go

200
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,600
into the mechanics
of the integral.

201
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:55,970
But so this is Q1 is equal to
our constant terms, nRT1 times

202
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,790
this definite integral.

203
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,220
All we have left in the integral
is 1 over V The

204
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,720
antiderivative of that is
natural log, and then you

205
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,390
evaluated the two boundaries.

206
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:11,040
So you get the natural log of VB
minus VA, which is the same

207
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,450
thing as the natural
log of VB over VA.

208
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,480
Fair enough.

209
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,510
This right here is Q1.

210
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:18,860
All right.

211
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,500
Now what is Q2?

212
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,220
Q2 was this part of
the Carnot cycle.

213
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,720
Q2 is when we went
from C to D.

214
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,540
   

215
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,080
So the magnitude of Q2 is
the area under this

216
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,330
curve, right here.

217
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,680
   

218
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,650
Now this is the work done to of
the system, so that's why

219
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,770
we subtracted it out when we
wanted to know the net work

220
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,050
done by the system.

221
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,510
And we ended up with this area
over here, when you subtracted

222
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,460
this as well, over here
on this side.

223
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,180
But if we just want to know the
magnitude of Q2, we just

224
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,150
take the integral under
this curve.

225
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,350
And what's the integral
under that curve?

226
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,370
This is the heat out of the
system, the heat that had to

227
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,520
be pushed out of the system
as work was done to it.

228
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,300
So that integral-- so we could
just say, the magnitude of

229
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:16,980
Q2-- I'll do it over here-- is
equal to-- the same exact

230
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,470
logic applies, just the
boundaries are different.

231
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,240
We're now going from-- and
remember, when we cared about

232
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,090
the direction, I would say,
I'm going from VC to VD.

233
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,140
But if I just want to know the
absolute value of that area,

234
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,900
because I just want to know the
magnitude, I could go from

235
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,900
VC to VD and just take the
absolute value of it, or I

236
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,610
could just go from VD to VC, and
I'd get a positive area.

237
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,350
So let me just do that.

238
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,910
So it's the integral
from VD to VC.

239
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,600
Remember, the cycle we went from
VC to VD, but I just want

240
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,270
the absolute value.

241
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,550
I want this to be positive.

242
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,810
So I'm turning it
the other way.

243
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,580
Of P dv.

244
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,200
And we do the exact
same math there.

245
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,050
You get Q2 is equal to
nR-- this time the

246
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,070
temperature is T2.

247
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,130
We're on a T2 reservoir.

248
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,260
Times the natural log--
and this time,

249
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,420
what's it going to be?

250
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,150
Times the natural log of--
instead of VB over VA, it's

251
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:28,800
going to be VC divided by VD.

252
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,900
   

253
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,680
Now let's use these two pieces
of information and substitute

254
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,450
them back into that results for
efficiency we just got.

255
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,220
We just learned that you could
also write the efficiency of

256
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,170
an engine to be equal
to 1 minus Q-- let's

257
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:46,930
look back at it.

258
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,350
1 minus Q2 over Q1.

259
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,070
   

260
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,390
So let's substitute Q2 there
and Q1 over here.

261
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,820
And what do you get?

262
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,590
You get the efficiency of your
engine is equal to 1 minus--

263
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:08,090
Q2 is this expression over
here-- nRT2 times the natural

264
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:20,100
log of VC over VD, all of that
divided by Q1, which is this

265
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,186
one over here.

266
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:29,720
nRT1 times the natural
log of VB over VA.

267
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,680
Now we can do a little
bit of canceling.

268
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
Obviously the n and
the r is cancel.

269
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,930
And we have these natural
logs and all of that.

270
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,300
But I had a whole video
dedicated to show you that VC

271
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,370
over dv is equal
to VB over VA.

272
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,450
Now, if we know that these
are equal, then

273
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,460
this is equal to this.

274
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,840
So the natural logs
of them are equal,

275
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,260
so we can just divide.

276
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,850
And what are we left with?

277
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,350
We're left with the fact that
efficiency can also be written

278
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:08,550
as 1 minus T2 over T1
for a Carnot engine.

279
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,980
Remember, this time, what we did
over here, this applied to

280
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,970
any engine.

281
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,130
This was just a little bit of
math and the definition of

282
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,950
what work is, and-- well,
I won't go too much

283
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,850
into it right now.

284
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,490
But this is for a Carnot
engine, right?

285
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,580
Because we did a little bit of
work here that involved the

286
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,020
Carnot cycle.

287
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,850
But this is a pretty bit
important outcome, because

288
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,600
we're going to show that the
Carnot engine, in the next

289
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,800
video, is actually the most
efficient engine that can ever

290
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,870
be attained.

291
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,150
Well, you have to be very
careful about that, that when

292
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,940
we say efficient, it means that
between two temperature

293
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,430
sources, you can't get a more
efficient engine than the

294
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,070
Carnot engine.

295
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,620
Now, I'm not saying it's the
best engine, or it's a

296
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,630
practical engine, or you'd want
it to power your lawn

297
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,050
mower or your jet plane.

298
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm just saying that it's the
most efficient engine between

299
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,340
these two temperature
reservoirs.

300
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,770
And I'll show you that
in the next video.
