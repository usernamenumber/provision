99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the graph below,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for what values of theta does cosine of theta

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal one and for what values of theta does

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cosine of theta equal negative one? And they have very nicely

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
graphed it for us. The horizontal axis is the theta axis

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the vertical axis is the y axis and so

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is the graph of y is equal to cosine of theta.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it makes sense with the unit circle definition

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'll just make sure we're comfortable with that because the unit circle definition

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let me draw ourselves a

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
unit circle and I'm going to draw it very roughly just so we get the general idea

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of what's going on here. When theta is equal to zero

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Where this point right over here on the unit circle. Well

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what's the x coordinate of that point? Well it's one and you see when theta

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to zero on this graph, cosine

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of theta is equal to one

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when theta is equal to pi over 2 we're at this point

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the unit circle and the x coordinate is what
