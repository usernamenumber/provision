1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,000
   

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,029
Microwaves can pop

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,040
your popcorn. They can catch you speeding.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,059
They carry thousands of phone channels to speed your calls.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,080
But can microwaves help us learn about our world and our Universe?

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,090
Let's find out. With wavelengths ranging from 30 centimeters down

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,100
to one millimeter, microwaves fall between radio waves and infrared.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,110
Microwaves are used in doppler radar which is

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,120
widely used for short term localized weather forecasting and what you

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,130
see on TV weather news. Satellites have revolutionized

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,150
weather forecasting by providing a global view of weather patterns

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,160
and surface temperatures. This unique perspective has greatly increased the accuracy

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,180
of tropical storm and climate forecasts.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,190
Different wavelengths of microwaves, grouped into bands, provide different

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,200
information to scientists. Medium-length C-band microwaves

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,209
penetrate through clouds, dust, smoke, snow and rain

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,210
to reveal the Earth's surface. Satellite microwave measurements

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,230
reveal the full Arctic sea ice cover every day, even where clouds exist.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,240
These measurements show great variability from year to year,

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,250
but also show an overall decrease in Arctic sea ice since the late 1970's,

21
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,270
illustrated here with maps and a time series of Arctic sea ice

22
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,290
in September, at the end of the summer melt. The Japanese

23
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,300
Earth Resources Satellite uses longer wavelength L-band microwaves

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,310
for forest mapping by measuring surface soil moisture -

25
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,320
such as this image of the Amazon basin - to identify areas of recent deforestation.

26
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,340
L-band microwaves are also used by Global Positioning Systems

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,350
such as the one in your car. Scientists routinely

28
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,370
combine microwave information with information from other parts of the EM spectrum

29
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,380
to study the composition of cosmic dust, or of a supernova

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,400
such as this supernova image that combines x-ray, radio and microwave data.

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,410
This recently known supernova in the Milky Way exploded

32
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,430
just over 140 years ago at the time of the American Civil War.

33
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,440
One important phenomenon is unique to microwaves.

34
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,450
In 1965, using long, L-band microwaves,

35
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,470
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson made an incredible accidental discovery;

36
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,480
they detected what they thought was noise from their instrument,

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,490
but was actually a constant background signal coming from everywhere in space.

38
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,510
This radiation is called "Cosmic Microwave Background" and if our eyes

39
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,530
could see microwaves, the entire sky would glow with a nearly uniform

40
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,550
brightness in every direction. The existence of this background radiation

41
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,580
has served as important evidence supporting the Big Bang theory

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,590
for how our universe began. Microwaves have become both staples

43
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,610
and wonders of modern life. They are also the backbone

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,630
of communications and of Earth sensing systems, and they are

45
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,980
an excellent guide to the ancient history and origins of our Universe.
