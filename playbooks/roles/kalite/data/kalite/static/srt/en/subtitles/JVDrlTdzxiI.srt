1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,810
I have here three linear
equations of four unknowns.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,050
And like the first video, where
I talked about reduced

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,690
row echelon form, and solving
systems of linear equations

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,510
using augmented matrices, at
least my gut feeling says,

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,720
look, I have fewer equations
than variables, so I probably

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,470
won't be able to constrain
this enough.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,370
Or maybe I'll have an infinite
number of solutions.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,690
But let's see if I'm right.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,720
So let's construct the augmented
matrix for this

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,310
system of equations.

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:33,190
My coefficients on the x1
terms are 1, 1, and 2.

12
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,230
Coefficients on the x2
are 2, 2, and 4.

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,680
Coefficients on x3
are 1, 2, and 0.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,190
There's of course no x3 term,
so we can view it as a 0

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,060
coefficient.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,750
Coefficients on the x4 are
1, minus 1, and 6.

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,080
And then on the right-hand side
of the equals sign, I

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,670
have 8, 12, and 4.

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,360
There's my augmented matrix,
now let's put this guy into

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,430
reduced row echelon form.

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,640
The first thing I want to do is,
I want to zero out these

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,500
two rows right here.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,910
So what can we do?

24
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,550
I'm going to keep my first row
the same for now, so it's 1,

25
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,450
2, 1, 1, 8.

26
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,080
That line essentially represents
my equals sign.

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,670
What I can do is, let me
subtract-- let me replace the

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,170
second row with the second
row minus the first row.

29
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:45,735
So 1 minus 1 is 0, 2 minus 2
is 0, 2 minus 1 is 1, 1--

30
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:54,530
negative 1 minus 1 is minus 2,
and then 12 minus 8 is 4.

31
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,140
There you go, that looks good so
far, it looks like column,

32
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,680
or x2 which is represented by
column two, looks like it

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,590
might be a free variable, but
we're not 100% sure yet.

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,240
Let's do all of our rows.

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,910
So let's take-- to get rid of
this guy right here, let's

36
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,620
replace our third equation with
the third equation minus

37
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,720
two times our first equation.

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:26,950
So we get 2 minus 2 times 1 is
0, 4 minus 2 times 2, well

39
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:35,800
that's 0, 0 minus 2 times
1, that's minus 2.

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,330
6 minus 2 times 1, well
that's 4, right?

41
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,600
6 minus 2.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,380
And then 4 minus 2 times
8, is minus 16, 4

43
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,510
minus 16 is minus 12.

44
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,570
Now what can we do?

45
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,740
Well, let's see if we can
get rid of this minus

46
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,100
2 term right there.

47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,640
So let me rewrite my
augmented matrix.

48
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,510
I'm going to keep row two the
same this time, so I get a 0,

49
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,390
0, 1, minus 2, and essentially
my equals sign, or the

50
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,070
augmented part of the matrix.

51
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,700
And now let's see
what I can do.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,564
Let me get rid of this 0 up
here, because I want to get

53
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:21,090
into reduced row echelon form.

54
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,170
So any of my pivot entries,
which are always going to have

55
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,800
the coefficient 1, or the entry
1, it should be the only

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,560
non-zero term in my row.

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,910
How do I get rid of
this one here?

58
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,720
Well I can subtract-- I can
replace row one with row 1

59
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,000
minus row 2.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,380
So 1 minus 0 is 1, 2 minus 0 is
2, 1 minus 1 is 0, 1 minus

61
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,520
minus 2, that's 1 plus
2, which is 3.

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,750
And then 8 minus 4 is 4.

63
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,200
And now how can I get
rid of this guy?

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,910
Well let me replace row 3 with
row 3 plus 2 times row 1.

65
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,780
Sorry, with row 3 plus
2 times row 2.

66
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,050
Right?

67
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,600
Because then you'd have minus
2, plus 2 times this, and

68
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,410
they'd cancel out.

69
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,070
So let's see the zeros.

70
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,110
0 plus 2 times 0, that's 0.

71
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:26,120
0 plus 2 times 0, that's 0,
minus 2 plus 2 times 1 is 0.

72
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:35,220
4 plus 2 times minus 2, that's
4 minus 4, that's 0.

73
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,410
And then I have minus
12, plus 2 times 4.

74
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,175
That's minus 12 plus
8, that's minus 4.

75
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
Now, this is interesting right
now-- this is interesting.

76
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,170
I have essentially put this in
reduced row echelon form.

77
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,720
I have two pivot entries, that's
a pivot entry right

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,230
there, and that's a pivot
entry right there.

79
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,230
They're the only non-zero term
in their respective columns.

80
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,420
And this is just kind of a style
issue, but this pivot

81
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,010
entry is in a lower
row than that one.

82
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,930
So it's in a column to the right
of this one right there.

83
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,860
And I just inspected, this looks
like a-- this column two

84
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,120
looks kind of like a free
variable-- there's no pivot

85
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,410
entry there, no pivot
entry there.

86
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,820
But let's see, let's
map this back to

87
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,860
our system of equations.

88
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,990
These are just numbers to
me and I just kind of

89
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,600
mechanically, almost like a
computer, put this in reduced

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,010
row echelon form.

91
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,530
Actually, almost exactly
like a computer.

92
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,000
But let me put it back to my
system of linear equations, to

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,130
see what our result is.

94
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,610
So we get 1 times x1, let
me write it in yellow.

95
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:50,930
So I get 1 times x1, plus 2
times x2, plus 0 times x3,

96
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,080
plus 3 times x4 is equal to 4.

97
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,100
Obviously I could ignore this
term right there, I didn't

98
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,930
even have to write it.

99
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,220
Actually.

100
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,980
I'm not going to write that.

101
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,210
Then I get 0 times x1, plus 0
times x2, plus 1 times x3, so

102
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,860
I can just write that.

103
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,850
I'll just write the one.

104
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,650
1 times x3, minus 2 times
x4, is equal to 4.

105
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,580
And then this last term,
what do I get?

106
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,030
I get 0 x1, plus 0 x2 plus 0
x3 plus 0 x4, well, all of

107
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,080
that's equal to 0, and I've got
to write something on the

108
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,410
left-hand side.

109
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,240
So let me just write a 0,
and that's got to be

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,800
equal to minus 4.

111
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,070
Well this doesn't make
any sense whatsoever.

112
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,060
0 equals minus 4.

113
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,160
This is this is a nonsensical
constraint, this is

114
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,230
impossible.

115
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,430
0 can never equal minus 4.

116
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,653
This is impossible.

117
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,420
Which means that it is
essentially impossible to find

118
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,550
an intersection of these three
systems of equations, or a

119
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,030
solution set that satisfies
all of them.

120
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,220
When we looked at this
initially, at the beginning of

121
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,650
the of the video, we said
there are only three

122
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,170
equations, we have four
unknowns, maybe there's going

123
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,980
to be an infinite set
of solutions.

124
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,330
But turns out that these three--
I guess you can call

125
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,320
them these three surfaces--
don't intersect in R4.

126
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,560
Right?

127
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,970
These are all four dimensional,
we're dealing in

128
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,080
R4 right here, because we have--
I guess each vector has

129
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,210
four components, or we have four
variables, is the way you

130
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,130
could think about it.

131
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,100
And it's always hard to
visualize things in R4.

132
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,350
But if we were doing things
in R3, we can imagine the

133
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,560
situation where, let's say
we had two planes in R3.

134
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,680
So that's one plane right there,
and then I had another

135
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,930
completely parallel
plane to that one.

136
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,110
So I had another completely
parallel plane

137
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,490
to that first one.

138
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,320
Even though these would be two
planes in R3, so let me give

139
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,910
an example.

140
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,640
So let's say that this first
plane was represented by the

141
00:07:51,640 --> 00:08:02,680
equation 3x plus 6y plus 9z is
equal to 5, and the second

142
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,400
plane was represented by the
equation 3x plus 6y plus 9z is

143
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,170
equal to 2.

144
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,630
These two planes in R3-- this is
the case of R3, so this is

145
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,540
R3 right here.

146
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,810
These two planes, clearly
they'll never intersect.

147
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,520
Because obviously this one has
the same coefficients adding

148
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,430
up to 5, this one has the same
coefficient adding up to 2.

149
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,690
And when, if we just looked at
this initially, if it wasn't

150
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,090
so obvious, we would have
said, we have only two

151
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,530
equations with three unknowns,
maybe this has an infinite set

152
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,230
of solutions.

153
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,659
But it won't be the case,
because you can actually just

154
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,799
subtract this equation, from the
bottom equation, from the

155
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,460
top equation.

156
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,570
And what do you get?

157
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,190
You would get a very familiar--
so if you just

158
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,220
subtract the bottom equation
from the top equation, and you

159
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,183
get 3x minus 3x, 6y minus 6y, 9z
minus 9z-- actually, let me

160
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:51,500
do it right here.

161
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,300
So for that minus that, you get
zero is equal to 5 minus

162
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,700
2, which is 3.

163
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,200
Which is a very similar result
that we got up there.

164
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,110
So when you have two parallel
planes, in this case in R3, or

165
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,150
really to any kind of two
parallel equations, or a set

166
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,620
of parallel equations,
they won't intersect.

167
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,290
And you're going to get, when
you put it in reduced row

168
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,490
echelon form, or you just do
basic elimination, or you

169
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,250
solve the systems, you're going
to get a statement that

170
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,720
zero is equal to something, and
that means that there are

171
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,970
no solutions.

172
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,030
So the general take-away,
if you have zero equals

173
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,840
something, no solutions.

174
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,770
If you have the same number of
pivot variables, the same

175
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,210
number of pivot entries as you
do columns, so if you get the

176
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,040
situations-- let me write this
down, this is good to know.

177
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
if you have zero is equal
to anything, then

178
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,760
that means no solution.

179
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,710
If you're dealing with R3,
then you probably have

180
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,680
parallel planes, in R2 you're
dealing with parallel lines.

181
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,930
If you have the situation where
you have the same number

182
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:02,960
of pivot entries as columns, so
it's just 1, 1, 1, 1, this

183
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,350
is the case of R4 right there.

184
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,390
I think you get the idea.

185
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,440
That equals a, b, c, d.

186
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,690
Then you have a unique
solution.

187
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,010
Now if, you have any free
variables-- so free variables

188
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,190
look like this, so let's say we
have 1, 0, 1, 0, and then I

189
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:30,010
have the entry 1, 1,
let me be careful.

190
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,320
0, let me do it like this.

191
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:41,040
1, 0, 0, and then I have the
entry 1, 2, and then I have a

192
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,520
bunch of zeroes over here.

193
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,370
And then this has to equal
zero-- remember, if this was a

194
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,760
bunch of zeroes equaling some
variable, then I would have no

195
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,330
solution, or equalling some
constant, let's say this is

196
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,820
equal to 5, this
is equal to 2.

197
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,120
If this is our reduced row
echelon form that we

198
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,860
eventually get to, then we have
a few free variables.

199
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,750
This is a free, or I guess we
could call this column a free

200
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,730
column, to some degree this
one would be too.

201
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,390
Because it has no
pivot entries.

202
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,280
These are the pivot entries.

203
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,420
So this is variable x2 and
that's variable x4.

204
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,910
Then these would be
free, we can set

205
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,240
them equal to anything.

206
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,170
So then here we have unlimited
solutions,

207
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,670
or no unique solutions.

208
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,510
And that was actually the
first example we saw.

209
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,540
And these are really the three
cases that you're going to see

210
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,880
every time, and it's good to
get familiar with them so

211
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,570
you're never going to get
stumped up when you have

212
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,930
something like 0 equals minus
4, or 0 equals 3.

213
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,440
Or if you have just a bunch of
zeros and a bunch of rows.

214
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,870
I want to make that
very clear.

215
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,550
Sometimes, you see a bunch of
zeroes here, on the left-hand

216
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,360
side of the augmented divide,
and you might say, oh maybe I

217
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,770
have no unique solutions,
I have an

218
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,730
infinite number of solutions.

219
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,380
But you have to look at
this entry right here.

220
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,880
Only if this whole thing is
zero and you have free

221
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,210
variables, then you have an
infinite number of solutions.

222
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,050
If you have a statement like,
0 is equal to a, if this is

223
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,380
equal to 7 right here, then all
of the sudden you would

224
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,000
have no solution to this.

225
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,390
That you're dealing with
parallel surfaces.

226
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,850
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
