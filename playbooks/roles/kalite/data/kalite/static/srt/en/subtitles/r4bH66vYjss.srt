1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
   

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,030
In the last video I was a little
formal in defining what

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:09,010
Rn is, and what a vector is,
and what vector addition or

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,610
scalar multiplication is.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,760
In this video I want to kind of
go back to basics and just

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,280
give you a lot of examples.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,130
And give you a more tangible
sense for what vectors are and

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,320
how we operate with them.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,490
So let me define a couple
of vectors here.

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,290
And I'm going to do, most of my
vectors I'm going to do in

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,390
this video are going
to be in R2.

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,480
And that's because they're
easy to draw.

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,070
Remember R2 is the set
of all 2-tuples.

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:41,580
Ordered 2-tuples where each of
the numbers, so you know you

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:48,910
could have x1, my 1 looks like a
comma, x1 and x2, where each

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,990
of these are real numbers.

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:58,290
So you each of them, x1 is a
member of the reals, and x2 is

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,580
a member of the reals.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,040
And just to give you a sense
of what that means, if this

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,880
right here is my coordinate
axes, and I wanted a plot all

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,710
my x1's, x2's.

22
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,740
You know you could view this
as the first coordinate.

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,500
We always imagine that
as our x-axis.

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,460
And then our second coordinate
we plotted on

25
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,350
the vertical axis.

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,380
That traditionally is our
y-axis, but we'll just call

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,930
that the second number
axis, whatever.

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,630
You could visually represent all
of R2 by literally every

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,030
single point on this plane if
we were to continue off to

30
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,820
infinity in every direction.

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,200
That's what R2 is.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,740
R1 would just be points
just along one of

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,760
these number lines.

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,460
That would be R1.

35
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,740
So you could immediately
see that R2 is

36
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,670
kind of a bigger space.

37
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,720
But anyway, I said that I
wouldn't be too abstract, that

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,020
I would show you examples.

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,840
So let's get some vectors
going in R2.

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,005
So let me define my vector a.

41
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll make it nice and bold.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,010
My vector a is equal to,
I'll make some numbers

43
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,210
up, negative 1, 2.

44
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:12,520
And my vector b, make it nice
and bold, let me make that, I

45
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,710
don't know, 3, 1.

46
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,440
Those are my two vectors.

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,950
Let's just add them up
and see what we get.

48
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,180
Just based on my definition
of vector addition.

49
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,460
I'll just stay in one color
for now so I don't have to

50
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,590
keep switching back and forth.

51
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:37,320
So a, nice deep a, plus bolded
b is equal to, I just add up

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,440
each of those terms.
Negative 1 plus 3.

53
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,520
And then 2 plus 1.

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,000
That was my definition
of vector addition.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,730
So that is going to be
equal to 2 and 3.

56
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,310
Fair enough that just
came out of my

57
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,780
definition of vector addition.

58
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,530
But how can we represent
this vector?

59
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,060
So we already know that if we
have coordinates, you know, if

60
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,230
I have the coordinate, and this
is just a convention.

61
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,610
It's just the way
that we do it.

62
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,840
The way we visualize things.

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,880
If I wanted to plot the
point 1, 1, I go to

64
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,870
my coordinate axes.

65
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,510
The first point I go along
the horizontal, what we

66
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,620
traditionally call our x-axis.

67
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,450
And I go 1 in that direction.

68
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,670
And then convention is, the
second point I go 1 in the

69
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,560
vertical direction.

70
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,090
So the point 1, 1.

71
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,880
Oh, sorry, let me
be very clear.

72
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,950
This is 2 and 2, so one
is right here, and

73
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,960
one is right there.

74
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,790
So the point 1, 1 would
be right there.

75
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,750
That's just the standard
convention.

76
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,090
Now our convention for
representing vectors are, you

77
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,160
might be tempted to say, oh,
maybe I just represent this

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,000
vector at the point
minus 1, 2.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,560
And on some level
you can do that.

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
I'll show you in a second.

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,330
But the convention for vectors
is that you can

82
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,350
start at any point.

83
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,880
Let's say we're dealing with
two dimensional vectors.

84
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,460
You can start at any
point in R2.

85
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,820
So let's say that you're
starting at the

86
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,720
point x1, and x2.

87
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,850
This could be any point in R2.

88
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,630
To represent the vector, what
we do is we draw a line from

89
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,120
that point to the point x1.

90
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,360
And let me call this, let's say
that we wanted to draw a.

91
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,630
So x1 minus 1.

92
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,160
So this is, I'm representing
a.

93
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,250
So this is, I want to represent
the vector a.

94
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,470
x1 minus 1, and then
x1 plus 2.

95
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,020
Now if that seems confusing to
you, when I draw it, it'll be

96
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,530
very obvious.

97
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,480
So let's say I just want to
start at the point, let's just

98
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,900
say for quirky reasons, I just
pick a random point here.

99
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,340
I just pick a point.

100
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,160
That one right there.

101
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,410
That's my starting point.

102
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,560
So minus 4, 4.

103
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,770
   

104
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,700
Now if I want to represent my
vector a, what I just said is

105
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,240
that I add the first term
in vector a to my first

106
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,570
coordinate.

107
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,350
So x1 plus minus 1
or x1 minus 1.

108
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,150
So my new one is going to be,
so this is my x1 minus 4.

109
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,880
So now it's going to be, let's
see, I'm starting at the point

110
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,980
minus 4 comma 4.

111
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,960
If I want to represent a, what
I do is, I draw an arrow to

112
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,220
minus 4 plus this first
term, minus 1.

113
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,890
And then 4 plus the
second term.

114
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,990
4 plus 2.

115
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,790
And so this is what?

116
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,640
This is minus 5 comma 6.

117
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,220
So I go to minus 5 comma 6.

118
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,670
So I go to that point right
there and I just draw a line.

119
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,210
So my vector will
look like this.

120
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,410
I draw a line from
there to there.

121
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,070
And I draw an arrow
at the end point.

122
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,330
So that's one representation
of the vector minus 1, 2.

123
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,510
Actually let me do it
a little bit better.

124
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,760
Because minus 5 is actually
more, a little

125
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,560
closer to right here.

126
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,240
Minus 5 comma 6 Is right
there, so I draw

127
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,220
my vector like that.

128
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,660
But remember this point minus
4 comma 4 was an arbitrary

129
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,440
place to draw my vector.

130
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,000
I could have started
at this point here.

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,740
I could have started at the
point 4 comma 6 and done the

132
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,380
same thing.

133
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,040
I could have gone minus 1 in
the horizontal direction,

134
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,190
that's my movement in the
horizontal direction.

135
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,030
And then plus 2 in the
vertical direction.

136
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,570
So I could have drawn, so minus
1 in the horizontal and

137
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,200
plus 2 in the vertical
gets me right there.

138
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,710
So I could have just as easily
drawn my vector like that.

139
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,890
These are both interpretations
of the same vector a.

140
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,360
I should draw them in the
color of vector a.

141
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,070
So vector a was this light
blue color right there.

142
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,300
So this is vector a.

143
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,520
This is vector a.

144
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,710
Sometimes there'll
be a little arrow

145
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,050
notation over the vector.

146
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,850
But either of those vectors.

147
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,540
I could draw an infinite
number of vector a's.

148
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,210
I could draw vector a here.

149
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,840
I could draw it like that.

150
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,280
Vector a, it goes
back 1 and up 2.

151
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,650
So vector a could
be right there.

152
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,160
Similarly vector b.

153
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,200
What does vector b do?

154
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,790
I could pick some arbitrary
point for vector b.

155
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,930
It goes to the right 3, so it
goes to the right 1, 2, 3 and

156
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,820
then it goes up 1.

157
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,970
So vector b, one representation
of vector b,

158
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,630
looks like this.

159
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,420
Another represention.

160
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,390
I can start it right here.

161
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,840
I could go to the right 3,
1, 2, 3, and then up 1.

162
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,820
This would be another
representation of my vector b.

163
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,790
There's an infinite number of
representations of them.

164
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,160
But the convention is to often
put them in what's called the

165
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,530
standard position.

166
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,490
And that's to start
them off at 0, 0.

167
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,740
So your initial point, let
me write this down.

168
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:59,280
Standard position is just to
start the vectors at 0, 0 and

169
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
then draw them.

170
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,100
So vector a in standard
position, I'd start at 0, 0

171
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,240
like that and I would go
back 1 and then up 2.

172
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,490
So this is vector a in standard
position right there.

173
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,930
And then vector b in
standard position.

174
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,450
Let me write that.

175
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,100
That's a.

176
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,200
And then vector b in standard
position is 3, go to the 3

177
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,950
right and then up 1.

178
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,220
These are the vectors in
standard position, but any of

179
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,140
these other things we drew
are just as valid.

180
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,860
Now let's see if we can get
an interpretation of what

181
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,669
happened when we
added a plus b.

182
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,580
   

183
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,429
Well if I draw that vector in
standard position, I just

184
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,630
calculated, it's 2, 3.

185
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,935
So I go to the right
2 and I go up 3.

186
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:50,030
So if I just draw it in
standard position

187
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,280
it looks like this.

188
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,110
   

189
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,370
This vector right there.

190
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,470
   

191
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,270
And at first when you look at
it, this vector right here is

192
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,730
the vector a plus b in
standard position.

193
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,300
When you draw it like that,
it's not clear what the

194
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,220
relationship is when
we added a and b.

195
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,020
But to see the relationship what
you do is, you put a and

196
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,190
b head to tails.

197
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,090
What that means is, you put
the tail end of b to the

198
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,210
front end of a.

199
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,780
Because remember, all
of these are valid

200
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,800
representations of b.

201
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,380
All of the representations
of the vector b.

202
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,620
They all have, they're all
parallel to each other, but

203
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,720
they can start from anywhere.

204
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,990
So another equally valid
representation of vector b is

205
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,310
to start at this point right
here, kind of the end point of

206
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,010
vector a in standard position,
and then draw vector b

207
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,620
starting from there.

208
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,860
So you go 3 to the right.

209
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,470
So you go 1, 2, 3.

210
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,970
And then you go up 1.

211
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,210
So vector b could also be
drawn just like that.

212
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,830
   

213
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,210
And then you should
see something

214
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,760
interesting had happened.

215
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,070
And remember, this vector b
representation is not in

216
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,650
standard position, but it's just
an equally valid way to

217
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,350
represent my vector.

218
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,630
Now what do you see?

219
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:13,320
When I add a, which is right
here, to b what do I get if I

220
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,220
connect the starting point of
a with the end point of b?

221
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,830
I get the addition.

222
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,340
I have added the two vectors.

223
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,300
And I could have done
that anywhere.

224
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,870
I could have started
with a here.

225
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,000
And then I could have
done the end point.

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,010
I could have started b here and
gone 3 to the right, 1, 2,

227
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,940
3 and then up 1.

228
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,560
And I could have drawn b
right there like that.

229
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,600
And then if I were to add a plus
b, I go to the starting

230
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,380
point of a, and then
the end point of b.

231
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,220
And that should also
be the visual

232
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,420
representation of a plus b.

233
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,580
Just to make sure it confirms
with this number, what I did

234
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,520
here was I went 2 to
the right, 1, 2 and

235
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,730
then I went 3 up.

236
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,300
1, 2, 3 and I got a plus b.

237
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,870
Now let's think about
what happens when

238
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,740
we scale our vectors.

239
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,180
When we multiply it times
some scalar factor.

240
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,860
So let me pick new vectors.

241
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,670
Those have gotten monotonous.

242
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,860
Let me define vector v.

243
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,550
v for vector.

244
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,620
Let's say that it is
equal to 1, 2.

245
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,980
So if I just wanted to draw
vector v in standard position,

246
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,130
I would just go 1 to
the horizontal and

247
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,180
then 2 to the vertical.

248
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,870
That's it.

249
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,210
That's the vector in
standard position.

250
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,620
If I wanted to do it in a non
standard position, I could do

251
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,160
it right here.

252
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,980
1 to the right up 2,
just like that.

253
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,810
Equally valid way of
drawing vector v.

254
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,950
Equally valid way of doing it.

255
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,740
Now what happens if I
multiply vector v.

256
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:58,570
What if I have, I don't know,
what if I have 2 times v?

257
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,060
2 times my vector v is now going
to be equal to 2 times

258
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,740
each of these terms. So it's
going to be 2 times 1 which is

259
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,800
2, and then 2 times
2 which is 4.

260
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,120
Now what does 2 times
vector v look like?

261
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,650
Well let me just start from
an arbitrary position.

262
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,390
Let me just start
right over here.

263
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,940
So I'm going to go 2
to the right, 1, 2.

264
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,880
And I go up 4.

265
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,220
1, 2, 3, 4.

266
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,530
So this is what 2 times
vector v looks like.

267
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,970
This is 2 times my vector v.

268
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,160
And if you look at it, it's
pointing in the exact same

269
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,690
direction but now it's
twice as long.

270
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,180
And that makes sense because we
scaled it by a factor of 2.

271
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,910
When you multiply it by a
scalar, or you're not changing

272
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,550
its direction.

273
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,180
Its direction is the exact same
thing as it was before.

274
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,250
You're just scaling
it by that amount.

275
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,530
And I could draw
this anywhere.

276
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,270
I could have drawn
it right here.

277
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,580
I could have drawn 2v
right on top of v.

278
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,780
Then you would have seen it,
I don't want to cover it.

279
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,330
You would have seen that it
goes, it's exactly, in this

280
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,570
case when I draw it in standard

281
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,100
position, it's colinear.

282
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,630
It's along the same line,
it's just twice as far.

283
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,750
it's just twice as long
but they have

284
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,700
the exact same direction.

285
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:15,450
Now what happens if I were
to multiply minus 4

286
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,880
times our vector v?

287
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,530
   

288
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,060
Well then that will be equal
to minus 4 times 1,

289
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,440
which is minus 4.

290
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,720
And then minus 4 times
2, which is minus 8.

291
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
So this is on my new vector.

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,270
Minus 4, minus 8.

293
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,020
This is minus 4 times
our vector v.

294
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,500
So let's just start at
some arbitrary point.

295
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,630
Let's just do it in
standard position.

296
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,850
So you go to the right 4.

297
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,910
Or you go to the left 4.

298
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,460
So so you go to the left
4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

299
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,890
And then down 8.

300
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,520
Looks like that.

301
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,140
So this new vector is going
to look like this.

302
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,670
Let me try and draw a relatively
straight line.

303
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,000
There you go.

304
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,290
So this is minus 4 times
our vector v.

305
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,730
I'll draw a little arrow
on it to make sure

306
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,540
you know it's a vector.

307
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,110
Now what happened?

308
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,640
Well we're kind of in
the same direction.

309
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,480
Actually we're in the exact
opposite direction.

310
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,970
But we're still along the
same line, right?

311
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,940
But we're just in the exact
opposite direction.

312
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,370
And it's this negative right
there that flipped us around.

313
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,850
If we just multiplied negative
1 times this, we would have

314
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,680
just flipped around to
right there, right?

315
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,150
But we multiplied it
by negative 4.

316
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,150
So we scaled it by 4, so you
make it 4 times as long, and

317
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,830
then it's negative, so
then it flips around.

318
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,070
It flips backwards.

319
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,500
So now that we have that notion,
we can kind of start

320
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,510
understanding the idea of
subtracting vectors.

321
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,320
Let me make up 2 new
vectors right now.

322
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:51,800
Let's say my vector x, nice and
bold x, is equal to, and

323
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,140
I'm doing everything in R2, but
in the last part of this

324
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,210
video I'll make a few examples
in R3 or R4.

325
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:04,170
Let's say my vector x
is equal to 2, 4.

326
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,720
And let's say I have
a vector y.

327
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,750
y, make it nice and bold.

328
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:16,410
And then that is equal to
negative 1, minus 2.

329
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,460
And I want to think about
the notion of what x

330
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,110
minus y is equal to.

331
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,790
   

332
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,970
Well we can say that this is the
same thing as x plus minus

333
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,250
1 times our vector y.

334
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:34,980
Right?

335
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,230
So x plus minus 1 times
our vector y.

336
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,700
Now we can use our
definitions.

337
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,260
We know how to multiply
by a scalar.

338
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,540
So we'll say that this
is equal to,

339
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,200
let me switch colors.

340
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,760
I don't like this color.

341
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,440
This is equal to our
x vector is 2, 4.

342
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,480
And then what's minus
1 times y?

343
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,070
So minus 1 times y is minus
1 times minus 1 is 1.

344
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,160
And then minus 1 times
minus 2 is 2.

345
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,030
So x minus y is going to be
these two vectors added to

346
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,620
each other, right?

347
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,340
I'm just adding the
minus of y.

348
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,500
This is minus vector y.

349
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:16,430
So this x minus y is going to
be equal to 3 and 3 and 6.

350
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,500
So let's see what that looks
like when we visually

351
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,690
represent them.

352
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,160
Our vector x was 2, 4.

353
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,980
So 2, 4 in standard position
it looks like this.

354
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,870
   

355
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,720
That's my vector x.

356
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,420
And then vector y in standard
position, let me do it in a

357
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,610
different color, I'll
do y in green.

358
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,865
Vector y is minus 1, minus 2.

359
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:48,960
   

360
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,980
It looks just like this.

361
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,105
   

362
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:58,980
And actually I ended up
inadvertently doing collinear

363
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,570
vectors, but, hey, this
is interesting too.

364
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,540
So this is vector y.

365
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,020
So then what's their
difference?

366
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,020
This is 3, 6.

367
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,720
So it's the vector 3, 6.

368
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,030
So it's this vector.

369
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,720
Let me draw it someplace else.

370
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,130
If I start here I go 1, 2, 3.

371
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,800
And then I go up 6.

372
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,920
So then up 6.

373
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,440
It's a vector that
looks like this.

374
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,050
That's the difference between
the two vectors.

375
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,900
So at first you say,
this is x minus y.

376
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,550
Hey, how is this the difference
of these two?

377
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,170
Well if you overlay this.

378
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,040
If you just shift this over
this, you could actually just

379
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,190
start here and go straight up.

380
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,710
And you'll see that it's really
the difference between

381
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,310
the end points.

382
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,250
You're kind of connecting
the end points.

383
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,250
I actually didn't want to
draw collinear vectors.

384
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,860
Let me do another example.

385
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,120
Although that one's kind
of interesting.

386
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,700
You often don't see that
one in a book.

387
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:57,450
Let me to define vector x
in this case to be 2, 3.

388
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:09,870
And let me define vector y
to be minus 4, minus 2.

389
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,980
So what would be x in
standard position?

390
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,950
It would be 2, 3.

391
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,250
It'd look like that.

392
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,710
That is our vector x if we
start at the origin.

393
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,990
So this is x.

394
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,640
And then what does vector
y look like?

395
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,580
I'll do y in orange.

396
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,740
Minus 4, minus 2.

397
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,500
So vector y looks like this.

398
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,540
   

399
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,325
Now what is x minus y?

400
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:41,750
   

401
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,020
Well you know, we could
view this, 2 plus

402
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,410
minus 1 times this.

403
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,090
We could just say
2 minus minus 4.

404
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,700
I think you get the idea now.

405
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,320
But we just did it the first
way the last time because I

406
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,540
wanted to go from my basic
definitions of scalar

407
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,030
multiplication.

408
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:01,420
So x minus y is just going to
be equal to 2 plus minus 1

409
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,390
times minus 4, or
2 minus minus 4.

410
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,610
That's the same thing as
2 plus 4, so it's 6.

411
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:13,420
And then it's 3 minus
minus 2, so it's 5.

412
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,740
Right?

413
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,360
So the difference between the
two is the vector 6, 5.

414
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,870
So you could draw it
out here again.

415
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,670
So you could go, add 6 to 4, go
up there, then to 5, you'd

416
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,360
go like that.

417
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,850
So the vector would look
something like this.

418
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,260
It shouldn't curve like that,
so that's x minus y.

419
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,850
But if we drew them between,
like in the last example, I

420
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,540
showed that you could draw it
between their two heads.

421
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,770
So if you do it here, what
does it look like?

422
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:45,510
Well if you start at this point
right there and you go 6

423
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,780
to the right and then up 5,
you end up right there.

424
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,240
So the difference between the
two vectors, let me make sure

425
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,300
I get it, the difference
between the two

426
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,610
vectors looks like that.

427
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,440
It looks just like that.

428
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,173
Which kind of should make
sense intuitively.

429
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,900
x minus y.

430
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,710
That's the difference between
the two vectors.

431
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,780
You can view the difference as,
how do you get from one

432
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,300
vector to another
vector, right?

433
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,860
Like if, you know, let's go
back to our kind of second

434
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,310
grade world of just scalars.

435
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,410
If I say what 7 minus 5 is, and
you say it's equal to 2,

436
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,210
well that just tells you that
5 plus 2 is equal to 7.

437
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,950
Or the difference between
5 and 7 is 2.

438
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,410
And here you're saying, look the
difference between x and y

439
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,710
is this vector right there.

440
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,680
It's equal to that vector
right there.

441
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,980
Or you could say look, if I
take 5 and add 2 I get 7.

442
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,850
Or you could say, look, if I
take vector y, and I add

443
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,780
vector x minus y, then
I get vector x.

444
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,750
Now let's do something else
that's interesting.

445
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,640
Let's do what y minus
x is equal to.

446
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,630
y minus x.

447
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,780
What is that equal to?

448
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,380
Do it in another color
right here.

449
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,760
Well we'll take minus 4, minus
2 which is minus 6.

450
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,850
And then you have minus
2, minus 3.

451
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,190
It's minus 5.

452
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,810
So y minus x is going to be,
let's see, if we start here

453
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,430
we're going to go down 6.

454
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,210
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

455
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,470
And then back 5.

456
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,350
So back 2, 4, 5.

457
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,530
So y minus x looks like this.

458
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,080
   

459
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,860
It's really the exact
same vector.

460
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,480
Remember, it doesn't matter
where we start.

461
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,590
It's just pointing in the
opposite direction.

462
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,360
So if we shifted it here.

463
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,460
I could draw it right
on top of this.

464
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,990
It would be the exact as x
minus y, but just in the

465
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,290
opposite direction.

466
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,500
Which is just a general
good thing to know.

467
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,930
So you can kind of do them as
the negatives of each other.

468
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,760
And actually let me make
that point very clear.

469
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,790
You know we drew y.

470
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:57,120
Actually let me draw x, x
we could draw as 2, 3.

471
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,280
So you go to the right
2 and then up 3.

472
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,250
I've done this before.

473
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,980
This is x in non standard
position.

474
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,450
That's x as well.

475
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,160
What is negative x?

476
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,760
Negative x is minus 2 minus 3.

477
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,280
So if I were to start here,
I'd go to minus 2, then

478
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,220
I'd go minus 3.

479
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,560
So minus x would look
just like this.

480
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,100
Minus x.

481
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,260
It looks just like x.

482
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,100
It's parallel.

483
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,590
It has the same magnitude.

484
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,140
It's just pointing in the exact
opposite direction.

485
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,790
And this is just a good thing
to kind of really get seared

486
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,360
into your brain is to have an
intuition for these things.

487
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,510
Now just to kind of finish up
this kind of idea of adding

488
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,410
and subtracting vectors.

489
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,400
Everything I did so
far was in R2.

490
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,270
But I want to show you that
we can generalize them.

491
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,920
And we can even generalize them
to vector spaces that

492
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,010
aren't normally intuitive for
us to actually visualize.

493
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,470
So let me define a couple
of vectors.

494
00:22:52,470 --> 00:23:03,210
Let me define vector a to be
equal to 0, minus 1, 2, and 3.

495
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:13,790
Let me define vector b to be
equal to 4, minus 2, 0, 5.

496
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,350
We can do the same addition
and subtraction

497
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,210
operations with them.

498
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,600
It's just it'll be hard
to visualize.

499
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,220
We can keep them in
just vector form.

500
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,320
So that it's still useful to
think in four dimensions.

501
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,470
So if I were to say 4 times a.

502
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,410
   

503
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,670
This is the vector a
minus 2 times b.

504
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,930
What is this going
to be equal to?

505
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,290
This is a vector.

506
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,190
What is this going
to be equal to?

507
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,310
Well we could rewrite this as
4 times this whole column

508
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,980
vector, 0, minus 1, 2, and 3.

509
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,390
Minus 2 times b.

510
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,106
Minus 2 times 4,
minus 2, 0, 5.

511
00:23:55,106 --> 00:23:57,650
And what is this going
to be equal to?

512
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:04,130
This term right here, 4 times
this, you're going to get, the

513
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,040
pen tablet seems to not work
well there, so I'm going to do

514
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,900
it right here.

515
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:14,040
4 times this, you're going to
get 4 times 0, 0, minus 4, 8.

516
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,830
4 times 2 is 8.

517
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,140
4 times 3 is 12.

518
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:24,600
And then minus, I'll do it in
yellow, minus 2 times 4 is 8.

519
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,560
2 times minus 2 is minus 4.

520
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,030
2 times 0 is 0.

521
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,240
2 times 5 is 10.

522
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,730
This isn't a good part of my
board, so let me just. It

523
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,430
doesn't write well
right over there.

524
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,910
I haven't figured out the
problem, but if I were just

525
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,410
right it over here,
what do we get?

526
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,270
With 0 minus 8?

527
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,460
Minus 8.

528
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,240
Minus 4, minus 4.

529
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,760
Minus negative 4.

530
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,000
So that's minus 4 plus
4, so that's 0.

531
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,170
8 minus 0 is 8.

532
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,150
12 minus, what was this?

533
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,140
I can't even read it,
what it says.

534
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,400
Oh, this is a 10.

535
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,510
Now you can see it again.

536
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,270
Something is very bizarre.

537
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,160
2 times 5 is 10.

538
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,110
So it's 12 minus
10, so it's 2.

539
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,940
So when we take this vector
and multiply it by 4, and

540
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,020
subtract 2 times this vector,
we just get this vector.

541
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,050
And even though you can't
represent this in kind of an

542
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,740
easy kind of graph-able format,

543
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,920
this is a useful concept.

544
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,860
And we're going to see this
later when we apply some of

545
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,000
these vectors to
multi-dimensional spaces.

546
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,041
