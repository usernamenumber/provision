1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,580
I have a matrix A.

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,430
It is an n by n matrix.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,620
And let me just write
its rows like this.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,070
Let me just write it as r1.

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,210
We could call them row vectors
maybe. r2, I'm not doing it

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:13,790
too formally.

8
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,510
This is just to save
on writing.

9
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,806
And then it has an ith
row, ri, and then you

10
00:00:19,806 --> 00:00:21,030
can keep going .

11
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,940
That's an i right there.

12
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,120
Then it has a jth row, rj, and
you keep going and you get to

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,780
the nth throw.

14
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,840
It has n rows and n columns.

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,330
So you get to rn
just like that.

16
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,130
That is my matrix.

17
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:40,450
Just to make sure you get what
I'm saying, so if I have a kth

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,280
r-sub-k is equal to ak1.

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,510
   

20
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,050
Maybe I'll write
it as a vector.

21
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,380
ak2 all the way to akn.

22
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,150
So this is just your standard
representation.

23
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,000
I wrote it this way because
we're just going to be dealing

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,360
with rows in this video and it
makes our notation a little

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,600
bit easier.

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,890
Let me focus on these
two rows right here.

27
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,630
And let me define another
matrix B that is

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,920
also an n by n matrix.

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,510
And it's identical to matrix
A except for one row.

30
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,720
So it's identical to matrix
A except for one row.

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,430
You have r1 just like
that; it's the

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,040
same as that one there.

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,020
r2, keep going, go down to our
ri, even that one's identical.

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,570
But rj I've now replaced.

35
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:41,300
I'm replacing rj with rj minus
a scalar multiple of ri.

36
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,110
Minus c times ri.

37
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,970
So minus a scalar multiple
of that.

38
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,730
I've replaced rj with that.

39
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,340
So this is equivalent to the
row operations we do we did

40
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,470
our Gaussian Elimination, or
when we put things in reduced

41
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,690
row echelon form.

42
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,930
And everything else in this
matrix is the same as A.

43
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,990
It's all the way down to rn.

44
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,160
   

45
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,610
This is our matrix B.

46
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,900
So let's think about what the
determinant of B is going to

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,330
be equal to.

48
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,580
I'll do it in blue.

49
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,780
   

50
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,330
Well, you could immediately say
that B is equivalent to--

51
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,216
Well, you can imagine
two vectors.

52
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:29,060
   

53
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,150
You can imagine two matrices.

54
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,790
One matrix that look
like this.

55
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:41,800
One matrix that look like r1,
r2, all the way down ri, all

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,110
the way down to rj.

57
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,140
And then you keep going
down to rn.

58
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,720
That's one matrix, which you
may have already noticed is

59
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,920
identical to A.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,820
That's one matrix.

61
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,320
Then you could have another
matrix here

62
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,050
that looks like this.

63
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,700
It's identical everywhere.

64
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,540
r1, r2, ri.

65
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,350
Some dots there to show you I
might have skipped some rows.

66
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,150
Skip some more rows.

67
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:17,350
And then you have c
times times ri.

68
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,710
c times ri.

69
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,760
Let me do that in a
different color.

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,130
This is ri right here.

71
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,800
   

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,550
And then you just keep
going down to rn.

73
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,490
Now, the determinant of B, you
could view as the determinant

74
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,120
of this guy.

75
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Let me write this here.

76
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,360
The determinant of B is equal to
the determinant of this guy

77
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,200
plus the determinant
of this guy.

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,150
Hopefully, you remember a couple
of videos ago, that if

79
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,400
one matrix-- Let's have two
matrices that are identical in

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,880
every way except for one row.

81
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,850
So these two matrices are
completely identical except

82
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,380
for what's going on
on the jth row.

83
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,210
Here you have a r-sub-j.

84
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,790
Here you have a c
times r-sub-i.

85
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,990
So it's a scalar multiple
of a row that you had

86
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,460
up here, this guy.

87
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,610
So this is ri, this
is the ith row.

88
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,350
Here you have an ri, here
you have an ri.

89
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,850
But here you have another
version of r row, scalar

90
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,610
multiple of ri, while
here you have an rj.

91
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,610
Now, if you have another matrix
that is essentially

92
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,300
identical to these two
matrices, except

93
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,710
for this one row.

94
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,130
And in that one row, it looks
like the addition of these two

95
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,210
matrices-- and let me
put a negative here.

96
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,320
So if you kept this matrix
completely identical, but if

97
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,690
you were to replace it with
the sum of these two rows.

98
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,750
So rj minus c times ri, you'll
get this matrix right here.

99
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,910
You'll get matrix B.

100
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,360
And we learned that the
determinant of B is equal to

101
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,620
the determinant of this
guy and that guy.

102
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,850
Remember, B is not the sum
of these two matrices.

103
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,810
B is identical to these two
matrices, except for that one

104
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,190
row where B's jth row is
equivalent to the jth row of

105
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,870
this guy, plus the jth
row of that guy.

106
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,220
And when I talk about adding
rows, you're just adding their

107
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,840
corresponding elements.

108
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:20,430
So I could rewrite this so this
row would look like-- The

109
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:28,650
first term would be aj1
minus c times ai1.

110
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,250
That would be the first
term in that row.

111
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,010
The second term of that
row would be aj2

112
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,650
minus c times ai2.

113
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,570
And it would go all the
way to ajn minus

114
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,820
ca-sub-in, the nth column.

115
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,480
So that's all it
means by that.

116
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,430
So the determinant of B is equal
to the determinant of

117
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,260
this plus the determinant
of this.

118
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,420
The determinant of this,
this thing right here

119
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,470
is our matrix A.

120
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,220
This is going to be the
determinant of A.

121
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,320
   

122
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,540
And what's the determinant
of this?

123
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,950
Well, let's break this down
a little bit more.

124
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,350
The determine of this
is equal to what?

125
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,025
This is completely equivalent to
A, except one of its rows--

126
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:18,570
Sorry, this is completely
equivalent to this matrix.

127
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,670
Not equivalent to A.

128
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,620
Be very careful.

129
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,810
Don't listen to everything
I say.

130
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,070
It's not equivalent to A.

131
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,340
The difference is that
A has an rj here.

132
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,740
This guy has a minus
c times ri.

133
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,860
So this is equivalent
to this matrix.

134
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,560
It's completely equivalent to
this matrix right here.

135
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,080
Let me do it like this.

136
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,510
So you have an r1, r2, keep
going, and you have an ri,

137
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,050
then you have another ri.

138
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,630
Let me clean this
up a little bit.

139
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,030
Let me clear this out
just so I have some

140
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,280
space to work with.

141
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,230
   

142
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,330
You have an ri.

143
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,430
You have that ri there.

144
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,740
Then you have another ri.

145
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,200
You have another
ri right there.

146
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,290
You have another ri.

147
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,760
So the jth row has
an ri there.

148
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,900
Then you keep going and
you have an r-sub-n.

149
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,320
These two guys are completely
equivalent except for this guy

150
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,840
has a minus c times
the jth row.

151
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,490
Right?

152
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,850
That's what this was,
right here.

153
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,820
This is the jth row.

154
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,420
Everything we're doing
is in the jth row.

155
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,520
This has a minus c times
the jth row.

156
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,740
   

157
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,005
So the determinant of this guy
right here-- Let me just be

158
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:38,520
clear that I'm only taking
the determinant of

159
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,970
this guy right here.

160
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:46,450
It's going to be equal to minus
c times the determinant

161
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,640
of-- let me write it this
way --minus c times the

162
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,600
determinant of r1, r2.

163
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,170
You have your first ri.

164
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,640
And then in the jth row
you have another

165
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,190
version of the ri.

166
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,480
And then you go down
to r-sub-n.

167
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,410
So times that determinant.

168
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,910
This is just the determinant
of this.

169
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,920
I've added brackets and
straight lines.

170
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,890
And we saw this a couple
of videos ago.

171
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,255
If you have a matrix, you just
multiply one of its rows by a

172
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,740
scalar, in this case minus c.

173
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,510
It's equivalent to minus c.

174
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,280
The determinant of the new
matrix is equal to minus c

175
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,160
times the determinant
of your matrix.

176
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,810
That's all I'm saying
right here.

177
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,760
But what is the determinant
of this matrix?

178
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,799
You might have already noticed
that it has duplicate rows.

179
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,440
It has an ri, and then in the
ith row, then it has another

180
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,090
ri in the jth row.

181
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,010
Remember, we kind of decomposed
this B matrix right

182
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,630
here as the sum of-- Or its
determinant can be described

183
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,930
as the determinant of the
sum of these two things.

184
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,400
B isn't the sum of
these two things.

185
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,500
Every other element is identical
to every other

186
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,410
element in each of these guys.

187
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,100
But this guy right here,
he has duplicate ri's.

188
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,580
And what do we know about the
determinant of a matrix with

189
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,110
duplicate entries?

190
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,260
The determinant is zero.

191
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,420
So this entry right
here is zero.

192
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,620
Minus c times 0, 0.

193
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,570
So the determinant of this
whole thing is 0.

194
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,430
So the big take-away right here
is that the determinant

195
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,930
of B is equal to just the
determinant of this thing,

196
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,090
which was the determinant
of A.

197
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,590
This is a very big take-away.

198
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,890
It's going to make our
life very easy.

199
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:31,300
The determinant of B is equal
to the determinant of A.

200
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,780
So if you start with some
matrix, and you replace the

201
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,700
jth row in this example,
but any row.

202
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,060
If you replace any row with
that row minus some scalar

203
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,020
multiple of another row-- we
picked ri in this case, that

204
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,560
would be ri --the determinant
will not be changed.

205
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,500
You have to be very particular
about how you say it because,

206
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
obviously, if you just
multiplied something by a

207
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,690
scalar-- if you were to change
its determinant, or if you do

208
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,700
other things.

209
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,390
If you just take a row, if you
take the jth row, and you

210
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,270
replace it with the jth row
minus c times the ith row

211
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,140
times some other row, which is
equivalent to just a row

212
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,010
operation that we have been
doing, then it will not change

213
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,060
your determinant.

214
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,670
Which is a very big take-away
because now we can carefully

215
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,210
do some row operations and know
that the determinant will

216
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,860
not change.

217
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,131
