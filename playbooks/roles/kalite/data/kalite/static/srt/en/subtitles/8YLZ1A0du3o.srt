1
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,995
How is it we should measure information in a way that

2
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:09,392
applies to any communication system you can think of  –

3
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:12,823
human, animal or alien?

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,461
Well, let's return to the late 19th century,

5
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:21,688
where, at the time, we were focused –

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,877
as we are today – on speed.

7
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:28,508
One goal to improve speed

8
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:30,816
was to design a machine which allowed

9
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:33,643
the operators to input letters –

10
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:36,281
which we can think of as 'primary symbols' –

11
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,911
and have the machine automate

12
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:40,455
the lower-level signaling events 

13
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:42,566
such as pulses of electricity 

14
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:45,312
[which] we can call 'secondary symbols.'

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,339
And machines can be driven by some clock source,

16
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,526
allowing [them] to generate a precise and

17
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:53,389
rapid pulse stream, which presumably

18
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:56,399
would run much faster than any human hand.

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,193
One great example of this was

20
00:00:58,193 --> 00:01:00,449
the 'Baudot multiplex system.'

21
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,346
The design was put into service in 1874.

22
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:06,655
It built off [of] the same conceptual ideas

23
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:08,350
we've seen in the shutter telegraph.

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,960
It consisted of five keys, which could be

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,047
played in any combination.

26
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,560
Think of a chord.

27
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,685
Each combination would

28
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:20,794
represent a unique message.

29
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,102
With five notes –

30
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:23,914
each either 'on' or 'off' –

31
00:01:23,914 --> 00:01:26,340
you can play 2 to the power of 5 –

32
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,912
or 32 – different chords.

33
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:31,939
The code assigned the 32 different chords

34
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:33,979
to each letter of the alphabet 

35
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:36,689
with [those] left over used for carriage returns,

36
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,943
new line[s], and spaces.

37
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:42,261
So the operator would literally play letters,

38
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,942
and their machine would automatically output

39
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:48,353
a pulse stream representing the letters.

40
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:52,364
Like this, for letter T.

41
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:56,873
Or like this, for letter R.

42
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:01,851
Or like this, for letter B.

43
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:06,299
So we have an output signal containing

44
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,740
various combinations of DC impulses –

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,370
a signal that accurately represents

46
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,331
the message typed on the teletypewriter.

47
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,196
Behind the counter, the mechanical nerves

48
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:20,459
of the system change words to holes on tape,

49
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,892
and the holes on tape to electrical impulses –

50
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,930
speeding over the wires.

51
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,786
Notice, at the lowest level, this system

52
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,995
is exchanging either the presence or absence

53
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:35,961
of electrical current – in a sequence divided using a clock.

54
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:39,190
So, how fast can our internal clocks run?

55
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,382
Well, the [factor] limiting [the] speed was not the clock.

56
00:02:42,382 --> 00:02:45,990
Then – and today  – the speed of transmission

57
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,875
was physically limited by the minimum spaces

58
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,190
between these impulses –

59
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,557
or the 'pulse rate.'

60
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:55,220
And this problem plagued engineers who were

61
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,435
testing underground [and] submarine cables,

62
00:02:57,435 --> 00:03:00,169
using the existing Morse-code system.

63
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:04,506
It's similar to an echo – or a sustained note.

64
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:09,450
If one sends dots too fast over a long, undersea circuit,

65
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,421
they will run together at the receiving end –

66
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:16,101
because the symbol we receive at the far end of the circuit

67
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:20,489
will be a slightly longer, smoothed out rise and fall –

68
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:23,821
not an exact replica.

69
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:26,340
Sending pulses too fast

70
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,608
results in inter-symbol interference.

71
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:31,147
This occurs, for example,

72
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:33,531
when the longer flow of a current

73
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:35,572
bleeds into the next time division,

74
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,730
and, perhaps, reverses a 0 to a 1.

75
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:40,108
So, even if we're automating

76
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:42,591
the detection of these current levels,

77
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:44,666
there is a fundamental limit

78
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:48,881
to how [closely] we can squeeze two pulses together.

79
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:50,232
And this is the same problem

80
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:51,625
Alice and Bob ran into

81
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,672
with their string-communication system –

82
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:00,863
which we called the 'maximum pluck speed.'

83
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:02,996
If they plucked any faster than two plucks

84
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,874
per second, they noticed [their signals]

85
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,151
started to bleed together,

86
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:08,531
and they got confused.

87
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:11,564
So this is called the 'symbol rate.'

88
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:16,454
Remember, a 'symbol' can be broadly defined

89
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:20,078
as the current state of some observable signal,

90
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:23,321
which persists for a fixed period of time.

91
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,556
Whether you are using fire, sound,

92
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:29,951
electrical current  – anything  –

93
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:32,910
a signaling event is simply a change

94
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,905
from one state to another.

95
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:37,521
So the 'symbol rate'

96
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,680
is the number of signaling events

97
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,740
which can be squeezed together in 1 second.
