1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,350
Let's say I have some subspace
V, that is a subset of Rn.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,100
   

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,690
And let's say that we also
have its orthogonal

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,820
complement, we write
that as V perp.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,410
That'll also be a
subset of Rn.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,520
A couple of videos ago, it might
have even been the last

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,820
video if I remember properly, we
learned that the dimension

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,040
of V, plus the dimension of the
orthogonal complement of

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,850
V, which is also another
subspace, is going

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,220
to be equal to n.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,880
Remember dimension is just the
number of linearly independent

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,470
vectors you need to have
a basis for V.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,320
And the dimension here is the
number of linearly independent

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
vectors you need to have a
basis for the orthogonal

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,460
complement of V.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,410
Now given this, let's see if we
can come up with some other

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,340
interesting ways in which these
two subspaces relate to

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:57,760
each other.

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,360
Or how they might relate to
all of the vectors in Rn.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,250
So the first question is, do
these two subspaces have

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,340
anything in common?

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,200
Are there any vectors that are
in common with the two.

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,580
And to test whether there is,
let's just assume there is,

25
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,830
and see what the properties of
that vector would have to be.

26
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:25,470
Let's assume right here that I
have some vector x that is a

27
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,230
member of my subspace V.

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,630
Let's also assume that x is
a member of the orthogonal

29
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,880
complement of V.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,180
   

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,590
Now what does this second
statement mean?

32
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:51,250
Membership in the orthogonal
complement means that x dot v,

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:58,050
for any v that is a member of
our subspace, is going to be

34
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,590
equal to 0.

35
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,770
Let me write it this
way actually.

36
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:07,660
x dot v is equal to 0
for any v that is a

37
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,860
member of our subspace.

38
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,620
That's what it means to be a
member of V's orthogonal

39
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,770
complement.

40
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,130
Now we assume that x is
also a member of V.

41
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,320
So that means that we can
stick x here as well.

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,270
For any member of V.

43
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,600
x is also a member of V.

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,310
So that implies that x
dot x is equal to 0.

45
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:36,990
Another way to write that is
that the length of x squared

46
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,970
is equal to 0.

47
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,560
Or the length of x
is equal to 0.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,160
And that's only true
for one vector.

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,110
You can even try it out
with the different

50
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,030
constituents of x.

51
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,750
The only vector that that's
true for is the 0 vector.

52
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,770
So x has to be equal
to the 0 vector.

53
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,320
That's the only vector in Rn
that when you dot it with

54
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,210
itself you get 0, or whose
the square of its

55
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,750
length is equal to 0.

56
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,510
And we've shown that many,
many, many videos ago.

57
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,310
What this tells us is at that
the intersection between V and

58
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,490
V complement-- this kind of
upside down U just means

59
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,840
intersection, it just means
where do these two sets

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,680
overlap-- the only place that
these overlap is with a subset

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,740
of the 0 vector.

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,070
So if I were to draw all
of Rn like this.

63
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,770
   

64
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,020
Let's say that this is Rn.

65
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,460
   

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,820
And let's say I draw
the subspace V.

67
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,870
   

68
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,300
And let's say I draw the
orthogonal complement to V.

69
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,440
It's all of these vectors
right here.

70
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,870
This is the orthogonal
complement to V right there.

71
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,805
So this is V perp.

72
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:54,620
   

73
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,920
These are all of the vectors
that when I dot it with any

74
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,765
vector here, I'm going
to get equal to 0.

75
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:00,050
So this is V perp.

76
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,410
The intersection, their overlap,
the only vector that

77
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:10,030
is a member of both
is the 0 vector.

78
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,640
That's their only
intersection.

79
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,490
So that's fair enough.

80
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,900
The only vector that's a member
of a subspace and its

81
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,500
orthogonal complement
is the 0 vector.

82
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,220
Nothing too profound there.

83
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,760
Let's see if we can come up with
some other interesting

84
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,010
relations between the subspace
and its orthogonal complement.

85
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,240
Maybe some arbitrary
vectors in Rn.

86
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,830
So let's just write down--
well we know that the

87
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:41,910
dimension of our subspace
V is equal to k.

88
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,470
   

89
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,400
If its equal to k, we know that
its dimension plus its

90
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,230
orthogonal complement has to be
equal to n, because we're

91
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,480
dealing in Rn.

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,570
   

93
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,165
And we also know that the
orthogonal complement of V is

94
00:04:57,165 --> 00:05:00,470
a subset of Rn, I drew
it right here.

95
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,030
The dimension of V
is equal to k.

96
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,610
That's a k right there.

97
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:13,290
And what's the dimension of the
orthogonal complement of V

98
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,470
going to be?

99
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,420
Well, when you add them
together-- I wrote that up

100
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,720
here-- they have to equal n.

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,100
So this guy's going to
have to be n minus k.

102
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,380
If you have k here.

103
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,310
This guy's dimension is k, this
guy's dimension right

104
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,840
here if, it's n minus k, that
when you add these two up, k

105
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,930
plus n minus k is going
to be equal to n.

106
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,760
So this guy will have a
dimension of n minus k.

107
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,100
Now what does dimension mean?

108
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,300
It means that that's the number
of linearly independent

109
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,690
vectors you need to
form a basis.

110
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,720
I have k vectors as
a basis for V.

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,540
I have v1, v2, all
the way to vk.

112
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:03,940
And this is a basis for V, which
just means they're all

113
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,210
linearly independent.

114
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,500
And they span V.

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,850
Any member of V right here can
be represented as a linear

116
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,070
combination of these vectors.

117
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,750
Now the dimension of the
orthogonal complement of

118
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,965
V is n minus k.

119
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,550
So we could have n
minus k vectors.

120
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:31,030
Let's call them w1, w2, all
the way to wn minus k.

121
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,600
We have n minus k of
these characters.

122
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:41,020
And this set is a basis
for the orthogonal

123
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,260
complement of V.

124
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,250
So any vector in here can be
represented as a linear

125
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,560
combination of these
guys right here.

126
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,355
And all of these guys are
linearly independent.

127
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:53,030
So you don't have any redundant
vectors there.

128
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,110
Now let's explore.

129
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,640
And I'll tell you where
I'm trying to go.

130
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,830
I'm trying to see if I combine
these two sets, whether I get

131
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,860
a basis for all of Rn.

132
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,390
That's what I'm trying
to understand.

133
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:20,100
Let's just say that for some
constants c1 times v1 plus c2

134
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:30,720
times v2 plus all the way to
ck times vk plus-- for the

135
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,990
constants on these guys I'll use
d-- plus d1 times w1 plus

136
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:47,960
d2 times w2, all the way to
plus dn minus k times the

137
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,010
basis vector wn minus k.

138
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,500
Let's say that I'm curious about
setting this sum equal

139
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:02,160
to 0, equaling the 0 vector
for some scalers.

140
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,120
The scalers are these
c's and these d's.

141
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,080
And we know that there's at
least one solution set of

142
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,700
scalers for which
this is true.

143
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,490
We could multiply all of these
constants-- c1, c2, ck, d1,

144
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,260
d2, all the way to dn minus k.

145
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,030
They could all be 0.

146
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,790
Or there might be more
than one solution.

147
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,690
In fact, if the only solution is
that all of these constants

148
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,240
have to be equal to 0, then we
know that all of these vectors

149
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,030
are linearly independent with
respect to each other.

150
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,990
And if they're all linearly
independent with respect to

151
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,919
each other, then we know that
they can be a basis for Rn.

152
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,830
But we don't know that yet.

153
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,460
We don't know that the only
solution to this is all of the

154
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,000
constants being equal to 0.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,240
So let's see if we can
experiment with

156
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,270
this a little bit.

157
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,820
If we take this equation, which
I just wrote down, we

158
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,885
know that one solution is all of
the constants, the c's and

159
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:55,110
d's equalling to 0, but
we don't know that

160
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,460
that's the only one.

161
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,100
Let's just subtract all of the
w vectors from both sides of

162
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,900
this equation.

163
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,880
So what are we going to get?

164
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,990
We're going to get c1, v1
plus c2, v2 all the

165
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,975
way to plus ck, vk.

166
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:15,750
And we're going to subtract
this from both

167
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,020
sides of the equation.

168
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,180
It's going to be equal
to the 0 vector.

169
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,510
Which is really just 0, I don't
even have to write it

170
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,600
down, but maybe I'll write
it down there just so you

171
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,040
understand.

172
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,380
I'm just taking this equation,
I'm subtracting these guys

173
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,140
from both sides.

174
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:40,870
So 0 vector minus d1, w1 plus
d2, w2 plus all the way to dn

175
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,920
minus k, wn minus k.

176
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,810
   

177
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,510
All I did is I subtract these
terms right here from both

178
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,200
sides of this equation.

179
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,900
I don't even have to write
this is 0 here,

180
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,800
that's a bit redundant.

181
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,290
So what I have here is I have
some combination of the basis

182
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,000
vector of V.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,880
So if I look at this, this is
some linear combination of the

184
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,650
basis vectors in V.

185
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:17,030
If I call this a vector-- let
me call this some vector x.

186
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:22,960
Let's say x is equal to
c1, v1 plus c2, v2 all

187
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,650
the way to ck, vk.

188
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,950
We know that it's a linear
combination of our basis

189
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:36,630
vectors of V, so x
is a member of V.

190
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,330
By definition, any linear
combination of the basis

191
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,380
vectors for a subspace
is going to be a

192
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,500
member of that subspace.

193
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,210
Well, similarly, what do we have
on the right-hand side of

194
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,560
this equation?

195
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,960
On the right-hand side of this
equation, I have some linear

196
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:59,140
combination of the basis vectors
of V complement You

197
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,490
could put just put a minus all
along that, but that won't

198
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:15,550
change the fact that this is
some linear combination of V

199
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,570
complement's basis vectors.

200
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,130
   

201
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:29,900
So this vector over here is
going to be a member of-- we

202
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,960
could also call this x.

203
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,800
So x is equal to this, but its
also going to be equal to

204
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,110
this, and since it can be
represented as a linear

205
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,650
combination of the orthogonal
complement of V's basis

206
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,580
vector, or V perp's basis
vector, we know that this also

207
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,730
has to be a member of V perp.

208
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,260
Let me just review this,
because it can be

209
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,980
a little bit confusing.

210
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,110
I just set up this equation
right here.

211
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,950
We know that there's at least
one solution-- all of the

212
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,920
constants equalling 0.

213
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,470
Anyone could do this.

214
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,660
Now I subtracted all of the
yellow terms from both sides,

215
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,310
and I got this equality.

216
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,430
The left=hand side of this
equality is linear

217
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,970
combinations of the basis
vectors of V.

218
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,390
So any linear combinations of
the basis vectors of V is

219
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,030
going to be a member of V.

220
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,720
That's the definition
of basis vectors.

221
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,770
So if I set x equalling to this
letf-hand side, I can say

222
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,560
that x is a member of V.

223
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,690
Well, if x is equal to the
left-hand side, it's also

224
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,540
equal to the right-hand side.

225
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,040
The right-hand side is some
linear combination of V perps,

226
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,160
or the orthogonal complement
of V's basis vectors.

227
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,980
Which tells us that x is also
a member of V perp.

228
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,960
Well, what does that mean?

229
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,710
That means that x must
be equal to 0.

230
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,240
I just showed you at the
beginning of the video, the

231
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,190
only vector that's a member of
a subspace and its complement

232
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,030
is the 0 vector.

233
00:12:54,030 --> 00:13:00,340
So we know that because these
are orthogonal complements, we

234
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,545
know that x must
be equal to 0.

235
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:14,300
   

236
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,870
So just to reiterate, we know
0's has to equal both of these

237
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,040
sides of the equation.

238
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,920
And these are the same
constants that we

239
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,560
had to begin with.

240
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,570
But what do we know about
these two sets?

241
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:34,680
   

242
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,120
We know that the 0 vector
has to be equal to this.

243
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,790
That's the only vector in Rn
that's a member both of V and

244
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,200
of the orthogonal
complement of V.

245
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,380
Now, this is a 0 vector and we
have this linear combination

246
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,210
of V's being set equaling
to the 0 vector.

247
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,920
What do we know about
these constants?

248
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,910
What does c1, c2, all the
way to ck have to be?

249
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,640
We know that v1 through
vk is a basis for V.

250
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,890
That tells us that they span V
and that they are linearly

251
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,140
independent.

252
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,080
   

253
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,030
Linear independence by
definition means that the only

254
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:21,330
solution to this equation right
here is that all of the

255
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,010
constants have to be 0.

256
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:31,190
So linear independence tells
us that c1, c2, all the way

257
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,785
through ck must be 0.

258
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:37,000
   

259
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,130
All of these guys right
here are 0.

260
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,790
Which is the same as
all of these guys.

261
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,380
All of these guys must be 0.

262
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,310
Now let's look at
the right-hand

263
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,590
side of this equation.

264
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,370
We could put the minus
all the way, but the

265
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,080
same argument holds.

266
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,480
This linear combination
of V perp's basis

267
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,330
vectors is equal to 0.

268
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,280
The only solution to this--
because each of these w1's,

269
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,510
w2's, and wn minus k's are
linearly independent-- being

270
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,860
equal to 0 is all of
the constants have

271
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,280
to be equal to 0.

272
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,130
That falls out of linear
independence.

273
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,610
If this negative is confusing
you a bit, if it makes it look

274
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,180
different than that, you could
just multiply this negative

275
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,960
out and say minus d1 would have
to be equal to 0, minus

276
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,910
d2 would have to be 0,
minus d and minus k

277
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,170
would have to be 0.

278
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,060
But it's the exact
same argument.

279
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,800
Linear independence, which falls
out of the fact that

280
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,790
this is a basis set, implies
that the only solution to this

281
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,660
being equal to 0 is each
of the constants

282
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,330
being equal to 0.

283
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,700
Well, that means that d1,
d2, all the way to dn

284
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,590
minus k must be 0.

285
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,290
Let's go back to what
I wrote up here.

286
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,690
This was the original equation
that we were

287
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,080
experimenting with.

288
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,640
Just manipulating this
equation a bit and

289
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,885
understanding that the only
intersection between V and V

290
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:04,950
perp is a 0 vector.

291
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,890
And that you only have linear
independence if the only

292
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:15,080
solution to these vectors
equalling 0 is all of their

293
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,600
constants equalling 0.

294
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,210
Then we know that all of these
terms, c1 through ck, d1

295
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,750
through dn minus k, they all
have to be equal to 0.

296
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,710
That's the only solution to this
larger equation that I

297
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,950
wrote up here.

298
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,620
Well, the only solution to this
large equation that I

299
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,960
wrote up here is that all of the
constants are equal to 0.

300
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:42,360
That implies that if I were it
take the set right here of v1,

301
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:49,270
v2, all the way to vk, and I
were to augment that with the

302
00:16:49,270 --> 00:17:02,360
basis vectors of V perp, which
are w1, w2, all the way to wn

303
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,050
minus k, that this is a linearly
independent set.

304
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:13,770
   

305
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,480
And I know that because the only
solution to this equation

306
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,720
is each of these constants
having to be equal to 0.

307
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,700
That's what linear independence
means.

308
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,900
This implies this.

309
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,760
Linear independence
implies that.

310
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,620
We used the fact that linear
independence implies that all

311
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,100
of these equal 0 to get the fact
that c1 all the way to ck

312
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,450
was equal to 0.

313
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,080
And then we use it again when
we set this thing also being

314
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,190
equal to the 0 vector.

315
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,760
We knew that all of the d's
had to be equal to 0.

316
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,930
I don't know if you remember,
the 0 vector came out from the

317
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,980
fact that that was the
only vector that is a

318
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,420
member of both sets.

319
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,945
I know I'm being a little bit
repetitive, but I really want

320
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,270
you to understand that this
proof isn't some type of

321
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,200
circular proof.

322
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,210
That we just wrote this
equation, we wondered about

323
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,530
what the solution set is to it,
we rearranged it, we said

324
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,950
hey both sides of this equation
are members of both V

325
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,900
and V perp.

326
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,085
The only vector that's
a member of

327
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:09,210
both is the 0 vector.

328
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,530
So both of these sides
of the equation have

329
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,710
to be equal to 0.

330
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,170
The only solution to that is all
of these constants being

331
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,280
equal to 0, because
each of these are

332
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,960
linearly independent sets.

333
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,450
So therefore all of these
constants have

334
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,590
to be equal to 0.

335
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,490
And then this augmented set,
where if you combined all of

336
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,350
the basis vectors, that is
going to be linearly

337
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,380
independent.

338
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,420
Now many, many, many, many, many
videos ago, we learned

339
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:53,320
that if we have some subspace
with dimension n, and we have

340
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:01,380
n linearly independent vectors
that are members of your

341
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:16,010
subspace, then those n linearly
independent vectors,

342
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:24,660
or the set of your n vectors,
is a basis for the subspace.

343
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,780
   

344
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,900
Now Rn is a subspace
of itself.

345
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,370
Rn is an n dimensional
subspace.

346
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:45,050
   

347
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:50,430
We could write the dimension
of Rn is equal to n.

348
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:56,150
Now we have n linearly
independent vectors in Rn.

349
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,010
So that tells us that these
guys right here

350
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:09,910
are a basis for Rn.

351
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,240
We have n linearly independent
vectors.

352
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,790
We have n minus k that are
coming from V perp.

353
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,040
We have n that are coming
from V from their

354
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,570
basis for those subspace.

355
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,270
So now we have a total
of n vectors.

356
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,570
They're linearly independent.

357
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,780
They're all members of Rn.

358
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,800
So they are a basis for Rn.

359
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,050
Which tells us that any vector
in Rn can be represented by

360
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,950
linear combinations of these
guys, which is fascinating.

361
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,020
So this is a basis for Rn.

362
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:43,060
So that tells us that we can
take any vector-- let's say a

363
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,000
is a member of Rn,
some vector.

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,030
That means since this is a basis
for Rn that a can be

365
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,110
represented to some linear
combination of

366
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,930
all of these guys.

367
00:20:53,930 --> 00:21:02,160
So it can be represented as C1
times V1 plus C2 times V2 all

368
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,830
the way to plus Ck
times with Vk.

369
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,860
Let me use a different letter
just to make sure that you

370
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,550
understand that this is a
different equation that I'm

371
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,680
writing than I wrote earlier
in the video.

372
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,390
So I can write this, and then
I can have some other

373
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:21,050
constants that say plus e1 times
our V perp basis vector

374
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:28,360
1 plus e2 times this guy plus
all the way to en minus k

375
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,570
times the n minus k basis
vector for V perp.

376
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,860
I can represent any vector
in Rn this way.

377
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,930
Or another way to say it.

378
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,180
What is this?

379
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,440
   

380
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,420
This is some vector that is a
member of our subspace V.

381
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:56,600
And then this is some vector
over here that is a member of

382
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,380
the orthogonal complement
of V.

383
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,380
This is just a linear
combination of V

384
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,070
perp's basis vectors.

385
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,330
This is just a linear
combination

386
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,180
of V's basis vectors.

387
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:12,380
So given that all of these
characters are a basis for Rn

388
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,520
tells us that any member of Rn
can be represented as a linear

389
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,900
combination of them.

390
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:23,000
But that means that any member
of Rn can be represented as a

391
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,800
sum of a member of our subspace
V plus a member of

392
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,640
your subspace V perp.

393
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,330
This is a member of V, and this
is a member of V perp.

394
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,470
And that's a really, really
interesting idea.

395
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,210
You give me a subspace and then
we can figure out its

396
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,550
orthogonal complement.

397
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:51,290
Any other vector in Rn can be
represented as a combination,

398
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,720
or sum, of some vector in our
subspace and some vector in

399
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,110
its orthogonal complement.

400
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,230
Now the next question you
might be asking, is this

401
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,430
representation unique?

402
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,680
So is this unique?

403
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,636
   

404
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:13,325
Well let's test it out by
assuming it's not unique.

405
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:21,470
   

406
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,960
So that means that I have for
some vector a that is a member

407
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,650
of Rn, I can represent
it two ways.

408
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:34,530
I can represent it as equalling
some member of my

409
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:39,250
subspace V, plus some member
of the orthogonal

410
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,110
complement of V.

411
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,580
I can represent it that way.

412
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,250
Or I could represent it as
some other member of my

413
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,290
subspace V plus some other
member of my orthogonal

414
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,310
complement.

415
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:55,930
So x1, x2 are members
of V perp.

416
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:01,050
And then v1 and v2
are members of V.

417
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,990
If we assume it's not unique,
there's two ways

418
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,830
that I could do this.

419
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,130
And I'm representing it
as these two vectors.

420
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,730
Now clearly this side of this
equation is equal to that.

421
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,780
These are both representations
of a.

422
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,820
So we can rearrange
this a little bit.

423
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,040
We could say that v1 minus v2--
if I subtract v2 from

424
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:24,300
both sides, I get v1 minus
v2 is equal to-- that's

425
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,790
subtracting v2 from both sides,
and if I subtract x1

426
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:31,065
from both sides-- x2 minus x1.

427
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:34,850
   

428
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,650
These are both members
of the subspace V.

429
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,890
And any subspace is closed
under addition and

430
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,405
subtraction, which is really
a special case of addition.

431
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:50,980
   

432
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,840
The vector v1, let me write it
this way, let me call my sum

433
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,850
vector z, being equal to both of
these guys which are equal

434
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,810
to each other.

435
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,720
z is the vector V1 minus V2.

436
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,310
Any subspace is closed under
addition, if you take two

437
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,880
vectors and find their
difference in a subspace, then

438
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,800
that resulting difference
is also

439
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,520
going to be in a subspace.

440
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,260
z is going to be a member
of our subspace V.

441
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,360
This vector right here-- which
is also the same thing we just

442
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,490
said that to be equal our vector
z-- is going to be a

443
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,800
member of our V perp.

444
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,170
Why?

445
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:37,800
Because both x1 and x2 are
members of the subspace V's

446
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,230
orthogonal complement.

447
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,630
And that is a subspace
as well.

448
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,580
So it is closed under addition
and subtraction.

449
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,270
So this is also going to be
a member of your subspace.

450
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,800
So we could also say that z is
a member of V perp or the

451
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,600
orthogonal complement of V.

452
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,680
Well, we've done this
multiple times.

453
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,140
This was the first thing
we showed in the video.

454
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,300
The only vector that's a member
of a subspace and its

455
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,450
orthogonal complement
is the 0 vector.

456
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,780
So z has to be equal
to the 0 vector.

457
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,760
So this is equal to
the 0 vector.

458
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,810
Well, if both of these are equal
to the 0 vector, we know

459
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,030
that v1 minus v2 is equal to
the 0 vector, which implies

460
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,120
that v1 must be equal to v2.

461
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,060
And we also know that x2 minus
x1 is equal to the 0 vector.

462
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,900
Or x2 is equal to x1.

463
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,440
So we try to say that, hey,
there's two ways to construct

464
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,500
some arbitrary vector
a that's in Rn.

465
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,300
And we wrote that down.

466
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:44,140
But then we found out that no,
v1 must be equal to v2 and x1

467
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,720
must be equal x2.

468
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,780
So there's only a unique way to
write any member of Rn as a

469
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:56,440
sum of a vector that's in our
subspace V and a vector that

470
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,880
is in the orthogonal
complement of V.

471
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,000
