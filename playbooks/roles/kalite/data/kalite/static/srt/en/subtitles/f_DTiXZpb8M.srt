1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
   

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,430
Let's see if we can build a bit
on some of our work with

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,040
linear transformation.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,290
I have two linear
transformations.

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,190
I have the transformation S,
that's a mapping, or function,

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,870
from the set X to the set Y.

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:24,690
And let's just say that X
is a subset of of Rn.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,736
Y is a subset of Rm.

9
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:31,450
   

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,670
Then we know S is a linear
transformation.

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,430
It can be represented by a
matrix vector product.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,080
We can write S of X.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,620
Let me do it in the same color
as I was doing it before.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,270
We can write that S of some
vector X, is equal to some

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,170
matrix A times X.

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,460
The matrix A, it's going to be
X, whatever X we input into

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,720
the function, although we
take the mapping of.

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,460
It's going to be in this set,
right here, is going to be a

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,560
member of Rn.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,500
This is going to
be right here.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,929
Let me do it like this.

22
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:10,490
X is going to be
a member of Rn.

23
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,340
Well, it's actually going to be
a member of X, which is a

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,690
subset of Rn.

25
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,060
I'm just trying to figure out
what the dimensions of matrix

26
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,310
A are going to be.

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,810
This is going to have n
components right here.

28
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,530
Matrix A has to have
n columns.

29
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,740
Matrix A is going to be, let's
just say, is an m by n matrix.

30
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,590
   

31
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,560
Fair enough.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,550
Let's say we have another
linear transformation.

33
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,870
Let me draw what I've
done so far.

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,760
We have sum set X, right
here, that is set X.

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,920
It is a subset of Rn.

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,600
Rn, I can draw out there.

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,140
We have this mapping, S, or this
linear transformation,

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,360
from X to Y.

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,610
It goes to a new set,
Y, right here.

40
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,100
   

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,870
Y is a member of Rm.

42
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,590
The mapping X, right here.

43
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,789
   

44
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,710
You take some element here,
and you apply the

45
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,920
transformation S.

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,630
I've told you it's a linear
transformation.

47
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,710
You'll get to some value in
set Y, which is in Rm.

48
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,590
I said that the matrix
representation of our linear

49
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,130
transformation is going to
be an m by n matrix.

50
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,350
You're going to start with
something that has n entries,

51
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,200
or a vector that's
a member of Rn.

52
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,750
You want to end up with
a vector that's in Rm.

53
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,750
Fair enough.

54
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,050
Now, let's say I have another
linear transformation, T.

55
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,780
   

56
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,520
It's a mapping from the
set Y to the set Z.

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,770
Let me draw.

58
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,880
   

59
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,790
I have another set here
called set Z.

60
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,230
I can map from elements of Y, so
I could map from here, into

61
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,420
elements of Z using the linear
transformation T.

62
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,370
Similar to what I did before.

63
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,010
We know that Y is
a member of Rm.

64
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,040
You know that this is a subset,
not a member, more of

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,070
a subset of Rm.

66
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,240
These are just arbitrary
letters.

67
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,770
It could be 100 or
5, or whatever.

68
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,020
I'm just trying to
stay abstract.

69
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,480
Z is a member, I'm running out
of letters, let's say Z is a

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
member of Rl.

71
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
Z is a member of Rl.

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,760
Then, what's the transformation
T, what's it's

73
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,520
matrix representation
going to be.

74
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,780
You know it's a linear
transformation.

75
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,270
I told you that.

76
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,890
We know it can be represented
in this form.

77
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:47,180
We could say that T of X, where
X is a member of Rm, is

78
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,700
going to be equal to some
matrix B times X.

79
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,720
What are the dimensions of
matrix B going to be.

80
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,040
X is going to be a member of Rm,
so B is going to have to

81
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,760
have m columns.

82
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,480
And then it's a mapping into a
set that's a member of Rl.

83
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,080
It's going to map from members
of Rm to members of Rl.

84
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,460
It's going to be
l by m matrix.

85
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,089
When you see this, a very
natural question might arise

86
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,940
in your head.

87
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,220
Can we construct some mapping
that goes all the way, that

88
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,250
goes all the way, from set
X all the way to set T.

89
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,330
Maybe we'll call that the
composition of-- I mean we can

90
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,870
create that mapping using a
combination of S and T.

91
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,800
Let's just make up some word.

92
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,790
Let's just call T, with this
little circle S, let's just

93
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,420
call this a mapping from
X all the way to Z.

94
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,290
   

95
00:04:52,290 --> 00:05:03,220
We'll call this the composition
of T with S.

96
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,280
We're essentially just combining
the two functions in

97
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,260
order to try to create some
mapping that takes us from T,

98
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,290
from set X, all the
way to set Z.

99
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,440
We still haven't defined this.

100
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,820
How can we actually
construct this.

101
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,590
A natural thing might be to
first apply transformation S.

102
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,510
Let's say that this is our X
we're dealing with right here.

103
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,990
Maybe the first thing we want to
do is apply S, and that'll

104
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,880
give us an S of X.

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,030
That will give us this value,
right here, that's in set Y.

106
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,750
And then what if we were to take
that value and apply the

107
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,210
transformation T to it?

108
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,540
We would take this value, and
apply the transformation T to

109
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,370
it, to maybe get
to this value.

110
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,610
This would be the linear
transformation T applied to

111
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:56,370
this value, this member of the
set Y, which is in Rm.

112
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,630
We are just going to apply that
transformation to this

113
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,810
guy, right here, which was the
transformation S applied to X.

114
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,380
This might look fancy, but all
this is, remember this is just

115
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,640
a vector, right here,
in the set Y, which

116
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,350
is a subset of Rm.

117
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,930
This is a vector that is in X.

118
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,290
When you apply mapping,
you get another

119
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,750
vector that's in Y.

120
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,870
You apply the linear
transformation T to that, then

121
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,270
you get another vector
that's at set Z.

122
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,815
Let's define the composition
of T with S.

123
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:27,640
This is going to be
a definition.

124
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,182
Let's define the composition of
T with S to be-- first we

125
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:35,840
apply S to some vector in X.

126
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,610
Apply S to some vector
in X to get us here.

127
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,310
Then we apply T to that vector
to get us to set Z.

128
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:49,440
To get us to set-- so we apply
T to this thing right there.

129
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,530
The first question might be,
is this even a linear

130
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,080
transformation?

131
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,300
Is the composition of two linear
transformations even a

132
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,550
linear transformation?

133
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:07,120
   

134
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,020
Well there are two requirements
to be a linear

135
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,620
transformation.

136
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,170
The sum of the linear
transformation of the sum of

137
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,410
two vectors, should be the
linear transformation of each

138
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,650
of them summed together.

139
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,500
I know when I just say that
verbally, it probably doesn't

140
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,270
make a lot of sense.

141
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,860
Let's try to take the
composition, the composition

142
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,760
of T with S of the sum
of two vectors in X.

143
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,450
I'm taking the vectors
x and the vectors y.

144
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,700
By definition, what
is this equal to?

145
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,280
This is equal to applying to
linear transformation T to the

146
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,070
linear transformation S,
applied to our two

147
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,190
vectors, x plus y.

148
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,130
What is this equal to?

149
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,540
I told you at the beginning of
the video, that S is a linear

150
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,720
transformation.

151
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,890
So by definition, of a linear
transformation, one of our

152
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,940
requirements, we know that S of
x plus y is the same thing

153
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:11,400
as S of x plus S of y, because
S is a linear transformation.

154
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,120
We know that is true.

155
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,210
We know that we can replace this
thing right there with

156
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,900
that thing right there.

157
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,220
We also know that T is a
linear transformation.

158
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,940
Which means that the
transformation applied to the

159
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,750
sum of two vectors is equal to
the transformation of each of

160
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,370
the vectors summed up.

161
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,289
The transformation of S of x, or
the transformation applied

162
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,320
to the transformation of S
applied to x, I know the

163
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:49,200
terminology is getting confused,
plus T of S of y.

164
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,320
We can do this because we
know that T is a linear

165
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,350
transformation.

166
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,650
But what is this right here?

167
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,260
All this statement right here is
equal to the composition of

168
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:06,720
T with S, applied to x, plus the
composition of T with S,

169
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,960
applied to y.

170
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,320
Given that both T and S are
linear transformations, we got

171
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,580
our first requirement.

172
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,520
That the composition applied to
the sum of two vectors is

173
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,470
equal to the composition
applied to each of the

174
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,940
vectors summed up.

175
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,660
That was our first requirement
for linear transformation.

176
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,930
Our second one is, we need
to apply this to a scalar

177
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,270
multiple of a vector in X.

178
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,030
So, T of S, or let me say it
this way, the composition of T

179
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,090
with S applied to some scalar
multiple of some vector x,

180
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,790
that's in our set X.

181
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,630
This is a vector x,
that's our set X.

182
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,510
This should be a capital X.

183
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,220
This is equal to what.

184
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,740
Well, by our definition of our
linear, of our composition,

185
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,620
this is equal to the
transformation T applied to

186
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:03,760
the transformation S, applied
to c times our vector x.

187
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,570
What is this equal to?

188
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,380
We know that this is a linear
transformation.

189
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,910
Given that this is a linear
transformation, that S is a

190
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,060
linear transformation, we know
that this can be rewritten as

191
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,860
T times c times S
applied to x.

192
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,470
This little replacing that I
did, with S applied to c times

193
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,600
x, is the same thing as
c times the linear

194
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,170
transformation applied to x.

195
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,630
This just comes out of the
fact that S is a linear

196
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,330
transformation.

197
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,370
We've done that multiple
times.

198
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,170
Now we have T applied
to some scalar

199
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,470
multiple of some vector.

200
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,460
We can do the same thing.

201
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,570
We know that T is a linear
transformation.

202
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,990
We know that this is equal to,
I'll do it down here, this is

203
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:51,960
equal to c times T applied to
S applied to some vector x

204
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,370
that's in there.

205
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,780
What is this equal =?

206
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:00,990
This is equal to the constant c
times the composition T with

207
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,400
S of our vector x right there.

208
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,930
We've met our second requirement
for linear

209
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,530
transformation.

210
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,940
The composition as we've defined
it is definitely a

211
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,190
linear transformation.

212
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,160
   

213
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,400
This means that the composition
of T with S can be

214
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,400
written as some matrix-- let
me write it this way-- the

215
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,490
composition of T with
S applied to, or the

216
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,580
transformation of, which is
a composition of T with S,

217
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:40,210
applied to some vector x, can
be written as some matrix

218
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,800
times our vector x.

219
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,130
And what will be the dimensions
of our matrix?

220
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,990
We're going from a n dimension
space, so this is going to

221
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,210
have n columns, to a
l dimension space.

222
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,290
So this is going
to have l rows.

223
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,160
This is going to be
an l by n matrix.

224
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,870
I'll leave you there
in this video.

225
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,750
I realize I've been making too
many 20 minutes plus videos.

226
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,010
The next video, now that we
know this is a linear

227
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,205
transformation, and that we know
that we can represent it

228
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:09,180
as a matrix vector product.

229
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,990
We'll actually figure out how
to represent this matrix,

230
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,490
especially in relation to the
two matrices that define our

231
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,910
transformations, S and T.

232
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,598
