1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Well let's review a little
bit everything that

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,740
we've covered so far.

4
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,970
So what was the Maclaurin
Series representation

5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,540
of e to the x?

6
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,900
And once again, you'll have to
take my word for it, that the

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,930
Maclaurin Series representation
really does equal, when you

8
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,040
take the infinite series, it
really does equal e to the x.

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,700
I mentioned in a previous
video that I was thinking

10
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,710
about the proof.

11
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,390
And I finally gave up because I
couldn't think of the proof.

12
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,710
And then I looked it up and I
realized why I couldn't think

13
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,740
of the proof, it's
quite involved.

14
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,540
But I will do it eventually.

15
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,080
Probably after I cover a lot of
other things just because it's

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,680
not something that you really
have to know to succeed well in

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,890
calculus, or appreciate
what we're about to do.

18
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,415
But I will do it.

19
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:38,540
It'll probably take
five or six minutes.

20
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,410
Anyway back to where we were.

21
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,250
So the Maclaurin Series
repetition of e to the x, and

22
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:51,510
it actually does equal e to the
x, is 1 plus x, plus x squared

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,040
over 2 factorial, plus x to the
third over 3 factorial.

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,870
I'm going to do a bunch of
terms and you'll see why.

25
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:04,940
And x to the fourth over 4
factorial, plus x to the fifth,

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:12,280
over 5 factorial, plus x to the
sixth, over 6 factorial, plus

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,500
x to the seventh over 7
factorial, plus x to the

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,540
eighth over 8 factorial.

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,600
And it just keeps going on
and on to infinity, right?

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,730
Only when we take the infinite
series does it exactly

31
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,450
equal e to the x.

32
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,010
Fair enough.

33
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,510
Well what was the Maclaurin
Series representation

34
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,340
of cosine of x?

35
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,880
   

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,530
Well that equaled -- and I'm
going to space them out in a

37
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,610
certain way, and I think you'll
see why -- it equalled 1 plus x

38
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,680
squared over -- oh no, sorry, 1
minus, this is a minus sign,

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,850
let me erase that because I
want to make this as

40
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,790
neat as possible.

41
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:05,760
Equal to 1 minus x squared over
2 factorial, right, we learned

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,600
that two videos ago, plus x
to the fourth over for 4

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,400
factorial, minus x to the
sixth over 6 factorial.

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,770
I think you might already know
know where I'm going with this.

45
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,090
Plus x to the eighth over 8
factorial, and it just kept

46
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,470
going, the next digit would
be a minus out here.

47
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,890
And it goes to infinity, right?

48
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,790
For that pattern, you
know the pattern.

49
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,100
And what is sine of x?

50
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,840
What's the Maclaurin Series
representation for sine of x?

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:47,830
Well, sine of x, it equals x
minus x to the third over 3

52
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:57,550
factorial, plus x to the fifth
over 5 factorial, minus x to

53
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,960
the seventh over 7 factorial,
and it just keeps going.

54
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,270
You'd have an x to
the ninth out here.

55
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,050
But it goes on for
infinity, right?

56
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,430
These all go on for infinity,
but you know the pattern.

57
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,280
So let's just pause here
because this is, I think if you

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,510
understand what's going on, one
of the few things in life that

59
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,880
will truly give you chills.

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,630
It'll truly make you believe
that there is a order to the

61
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,410
universe that we as
human beings can only

62
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,600
catch a glimpse of.

63
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,960
We have limited minds.

64
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,410
But we are on the verge, we're
scraping the surface, but

65
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,390
there's something amazing here.

66
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,250
Cosine of x and sine of x.

67
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,520
Each of their Maclaurin Series
representations, or if you were

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,980
essentially to write them as
polynomials, each of them looks

69
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,490
like it's almost like part
of e to the x, right?

70
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,960
It's almost every other digit.

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,000
And they would be the
same except for a

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,950
couple of sign changes.

73
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,600
Let me make that clear.

74
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,440
So what if I were to define
the function cosine

75
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,575
of x plus sine of x?

76
00:03:57,575 --> 00:04:05,800
   

77
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,760
What would that equal?

78
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,740
Or what would it's Maclaurin
Series representation

79
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,230
of that be?

80
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,300
Well, and then we know
that it's also equal.

81
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,030
But it's essentially
adding these two rows.

82
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:23,270
So it would be 1 plus x, minus
squared over 2 factorial,

83
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:32,200
minus x to the third over 3
factorial, plus x to the fourth

84
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:39,450
over 4 factorial, plus x to the
fifth over 5 factorial, minus x

85
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:46,020
to the sixth over 6 factorial,
minus x to the seventh over 7

86
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,290
factorial, plus x to the
eight over 8 factorial.

87
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,720
And it just keeps going, right?

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,890
The next one would be a plus,
it goes on to infinity.

89
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,220
Now I think it should be clear
to you that something, that the

90
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,940
goose bumps should be
emerging on your arm.

91
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,290
Because look at this,
and look at e to the x.

92
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,160
What's the difference?

93
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,940
Well, just a couple of negative
signs here and there.

94
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,590
   

95
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,500
Let me do it in a
slightly brighter color.

96
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,750
So the only difference between
this function and this function

97
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,760
are these negative signs.

98
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,090
And I've seen this before, I've
learned this before, people for

99
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,740
hundreds of years
have known this.

100
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,980
But I'll tell you something.

101
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,970
No one, even though they can
prove it mathematically, no one

102
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,780
really understands why this is.

103
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,880
Why we take these trigonometric
functions that appear, you

104
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,890
know, when we take the ratios
of the sides of a right

105
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,040
triangle, or the unit circle
definition, and you know it's

106
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,420
useful for, you know, triangle
measure, that's trigonometry.

107
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,990
That's where we came up with
this cosine and sine functions.

108
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,160
And it's related to the
circle and all the rest.

109
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,110
That when you add these two
fundamental functions together

110
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,200
from trigonometry, right?

111
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,360
Because tangent is really
just the ratio of

112
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,070
the sine to cosine.

113
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,950
So these are really what
trigonometry, this is the

114
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,590
basis of trigonometry.

115
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,350
When you add their polynomial
representations together, it's

116
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,320
almost exactly, except for
these negative signs, the

117
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,580
polynomial representation
of e to the x.

118
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,850
And the number e, and first
of all, this is an exponent,

119
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,310
these are no exponents here.

120
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,980
And e is just completely
unrelated, or at least one

121
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,410
would think from trigonometry.

122
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,760
Right, e is, we got e from
compound interest, you'll

123
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,800
see that it's related to
exponential growth, exponential

124
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,440
decay, when you have continuous
exponential growth and decay,

125
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,930
continuous compound interest.

126
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,620
If this number that is in a
completely unrelated field of,

127
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,870
not just mathematics, but
really the universe, right?

128
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,620
Continuous interest vs.
the ratios of the sides

129
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,210
of right triangles.

130
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,280
So this should already be
getting you thinking.

131
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,300
But what would be even more
amazing is if we could somehow

132
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,880
work with these to make them
a little bit more equal.

133
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,170
Well, the only thing that's
different are these

134
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,750
negative signs, right?

135
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,920
So do we know anything else
in mathematics, in our

136
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,400
mathematical tool kit,
that has this pattern?

137
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,690
Where it goes positive
positive, negative negative,

138
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,480
positive positive,
negative negative?

139
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,220
It has this essentially
the cycle of four.

140
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,430
Well you might be thinking, and
this will even give you larger

141
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,990
goose bumps, or make your
current ones bigger, the number

142
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,870
i, or the imaginary unit i.

143
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,390
So what are the powers of i?

144
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,370
This is a little review.

145
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,050
If this is completely
unfamiliar to you, you should

146
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,460
re-watch the imaginary
numbers video.

147
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,120
So what are the powers of i?

148
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:53,400
Well i to the zero is 1, i to
the first is i, i squared is

149
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,550
negative 1, i to the third
power, that's negative 1

150
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,570
times i, so it's negative i.

151
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,330
   

152
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,990
i to the fourth power is i
times negative i, so the

153
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,180
i's become negative 1 and
then you have a negative

154
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,770
there, so it becomes 1.

155
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,720
And the pattern repeats itself.
i to the fifth is i, i to

156
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,050
the sixth is negative 1.

157
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,040
We learned this before,
but it's just a review.

158
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,460
i to the seventh is negative
i, i to the eighth

159
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,840
then becomes 1 again.

160
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,690
So there you have it,
this is amazing.

161
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,796
i has that property where the
second two in the cycle of

162
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:37,670
four are negative, right?

163
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,100
We have a negative number here.

164
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,950
This is not necessarily a
negative number, it's a

165
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,090
negative imaginary number, but
we have that negative sign, so

166
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,300
it looks pretty similar, right?

167
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,430
Then we have two positives,
then we have a negative

168
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,610
and a negative.

169
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,390
And something else is
interesting going on here.

170
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,040
Wherever we see the imaginary
number, whenever we see an i

171
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,000
or a negative i, which terms
do they correspond to?

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,470
Well they correspond to the
terms of sine of x, right?

173
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,070
It corresponds to that term,
negative i corresponds

174
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,800
to that term.

175
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,020
i corresponds to that term,
negative i corresponds

176
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,950
to that term.

177
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,550
So we have something, it
seems a little bit even

178
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,910
more of a pattern.

179
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,260
But anyway, I just realized I
only have -- I have to say I'm

180
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,320
normally pretty smooth in these
videos, but when I start

181
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,820
talking about what I'm talking
about right now, my brain

182
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,750
starts to go in circles.

183
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,250
Because this is, I've actually
even heard, you know, what

184
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,300
we're what we're about to touch
on, as proof of the

185
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,420
existence of God.

186
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,150
And really, that's not that
much of an exaggeration.

187
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,100
It is definitely proof of the
existence of some hidden order

188
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,770
of the universe that we can
only catch a glimpse of.

189
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,520
And maybe you can
call that God.

190
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,500
But anyway, I don't want to get
metaphysical on you, but I will

191
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,910
see you in the next video.

192
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,900
