1
00:00:00,674 --> 00:00:03,109
I'm thinking about getting a life insurance

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:04,053
because I have a mortgage,

3
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:07,953
and I have a young son and another baby on the way.

4
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:09,421
So if anything were to happen to me

5
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:11,214
I want them to at least be able to

6
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:12,795
pay off the mortgage,

7
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,230
and then maybe have some money left over for college

8
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,693
and to live and whatever else.

9
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:19,135
and so I went to the insurance company

10
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:21,780
and said that I want to get a 1 million dollar policy.

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,859
I am actually getting a term life policy.

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,904
I just care about the next 20 years,

13
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,057
after those 20 years,

14
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:30,989
hopefully I can pay off my mortgage

15
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,123
and have money saved up,

16
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:36,292
and hopefully my kids would have at least gotten to college

17
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:38,433
or I have saved up enough for college.

18
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,684
That's why I'm doing term life policy.

19
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:42,635
Other option is to do whole life policy

20
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:45,537
where you can pay a certain amount per year

21
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:47,034
for the rest of your life,

22
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,065
at any point you die,

23
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:50,464
you get the million dollars.

24
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:55,816
At term life I pay 500 dollars per year for 20 years

25
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:57,849
If any point over those 20 years I die,

26
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,699
my family gets a million.

27
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,883
At the 21st year I have to get a new policy,

28
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:06,323
because I' m older and have a higher chance of dying in that point.

29
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:08,483
then it is probably going to be more expensive

30
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:11,148
for me to get an insurance.

31
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:12,349
But I am really just worried about next 20 years.

32
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:13,890
But what I want to do in this video is to think about

33
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,368
giving to these numbers

34
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,832
that have been quoted to me by the insurance company

35
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:21,365
what do they think that my odds of dying are

36
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:24,381
over the next 20 years.

37
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:26,165
I want to think of the probabilty

38
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:32,715
of Sal's death in 20 years

39
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:36,706
based on what the people in insurance company are telling me

40
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:39,508
or at least what's the maximum probability of my death

41
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:42,307
in order for them to make money.

42
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:46,647
The one way to think about it is to think about

43
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:47,947
what's the total premiums they're getting

44
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:50,732
over the life of this policy

45
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:53,250
divided by how much they are insuring me for.

46
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,016
So they are getting 500 dollars times 20 years

47
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:02,348
is equal to 10 000 dollars

48
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:05,368
over the life of this policy.

49
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:13,250
They are insuring me for 1 million dollars.

50
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,999
So they're getting,

51
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:17,069
let's see those zeros cancel out, this zero cancels out,

52
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:17,803
they're getting,

53
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,336
over the life of the policy,

54
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:24,336
1 dollar in premiums

55
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:33,390
for every 100 dollars in insurance.

56
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,099
Or another way to think about it is,

57
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,540
let's say that there were 100 Sals

58
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,001
a hundred 34-year-olds,

59
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,867
looking for 20 year term life insurance

60
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:43,550
and they insured all of them.

61
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,369
If you multiply this by a 100

62
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:54,711
you would get 100 dollars in premiums.

63
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:57,246
This is the case where you have 100 Sals,

64
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:59,122
100 people who are pretty similar to me,

65
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:01,814
100 Sals.

66
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,483
They will get 100 dollars in premium.

67
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:08,396
The only way they could make money is if

68
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:15,316
at most one of those Sals were to die.

69
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:24,568
Break even if only one Sal dies.

70
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:26,852
I don't like talking about this. It's a little bit morbid.

71
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:27,738
So one way to think is

72
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:30,064
they get 1 dollar in premium for 100 dollars insurance

73
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:31,897
or if they had 100 Sals

74
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:33,382
they get 100 dollars in premium

75
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:35,263
and the only way they would break even

76
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:38,037
is if only one of those Sal's dies.

77
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:39,819
So what they're really saying is that

78
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,702
the only way they can break even

79
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:45,629
is if the probability of Sal dying in the next 20 years

80
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:51,862
is less than or equal to 1/100.

81
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:53,165
And this is an insurance company,

82
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,147
they're trying to make money.

83
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,778
So they are probably giving these numbers

84
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,695
because they think that

85
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,002
the probablity of me dying is good,

86
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:02,342
maybe is 1/200, or is 1/300,

87
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,741
something lower,

88
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:08,319
so that they could insure more Sals

89
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,150
for every 100 dollar premium they have to pay up.

90
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,011
But either way

91
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:14,431
it is the back of the envelope of thinking about it.

92
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:17,184
It actually makes me feel a little bit better

93
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:22,015
because 1/100 over the next 20 years isn't too bad.
