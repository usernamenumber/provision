1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So now we're going to take the derivative of the sine of

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the natural log of x squared, so now we have a function

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thats the composite of a function thats a composite of another function

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So one way you could think of it: if you set f(x)

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to sine of x and g of x

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
g of x being the natural log of x

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the natural log of x, and lets say

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
h of x equaling x squared

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then this thing right here is the exact same thing as

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
take the derivative with respect to x

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
f of g of h of x

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and what I want to do is kind of think of how I want to do it in my head

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not having to write all of the chain rule notation, so the way I would think

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about this if I were doing this in my head is the derivative of this outer function of f with respect to the level of composition directly below it

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the derivative of sine of x is consine of x

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but instead of it being cosine of x it's going to be cosine of whatever was inside of here, so it's going to be cosine of

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
natural log, cosine of natural log of x sqaured

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so you could really view this, this part that I just

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
wrote right over here as f prime of g of h of x

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you want to keep track of things

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just took the derivative of the outer with respect to whatever was inside of it

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have to take the derivative of the inside with respect to x, but now we have

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
another composite function, so we're going to multiply this times-we're going to do the chain rule

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
again, the derivative of, we're going to take the derivative of

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ln with respect to x squared

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the derivative of ln x is 1 over x, but now we have
