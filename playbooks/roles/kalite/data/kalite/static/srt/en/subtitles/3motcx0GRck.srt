1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is an ancient ne...

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it tells of the God of the underworld, the god of the Death

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who is taking Persefony into the Underworld to be his wife against her will

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sometimes his is the rape of Persefony

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the thing that gets me more than anything is the look on her face

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
kind of crazed, terror

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can just feel it, her mouth, her eyes, her brows pushing together

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how hard she is pushing away

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how desperate she feels to get away

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean, it's a horrible moment. Man: It is.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well look on his face, I'm reading as responding directly physicly to the pressure of her hand

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but also as a kind of power of amusement

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Woman: I see glee, almost, as a in a terrbile way that makes it so much more terrible

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
look what I got

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She is also

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
she has no chance

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
look at the way that his hands press into her thigh

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you feel his force

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can see the elascicity of her flesh

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you forget this is stone

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You feel he's striding forward. You feel him pulling her towards him.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
