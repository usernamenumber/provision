99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we know that if we have two lines that are parallel, so let me draw those two parallel lines, l and m

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that's line l and line m

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we know that if they are parallel, then, if we were to draw transversal that intersects both of them

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the corresponding angles are equal, so this is x and this is y, so we know that if...if

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
l is parallel to m, then...then x is equal to y.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want to do in this video is prove it the other way around.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to prove, so this is what we know, we know this, what I want to do is prove

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if x is equal to y, then l is parallel to m, so that we can go either way

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if they are parallel then the corresponding angles are equal and i want to show that if the corresponding

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
angles are equal, then the lines are definitely parallel.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I'm going to do is prove it by contradiction. So let's put this aside right here, this is our goal

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm going to assume this isn't true, I'm going to assume it's not true

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm going to assume that x is equal to y

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and l is not parallel to m, so let's think about what type of reality

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that would create, so if l and m are not parallel and they are different lines

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they are going to intersect at some point

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is line l, let me draw m like this, they are going to intersect.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
By definition if two lines are not parallel, they are going to intersect each other

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that is going to be m and this thing that was a transversal I'll just draw it over here

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then this is x, this is y, we're assuming that y is equal to x so we could also call the measure

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of that angle x. So given all this reality and we're assuming that in either case, that this is some

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
distance that this line is not of zero length so this line right over here is not going to be of zero length

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or this line segment between points a and b I guess we could say AB the length of that line

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
segment is greater than zero I think that's a fair assumption in either case

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
AB is going to be greater than zero

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So when we assume that these two things are not parallel, we form ourselves a nice little triangle

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where AB is one of the sides and the other two sides I guess we can call this point of intersection
