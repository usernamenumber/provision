1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:05,033
Use substitution to solve for x and y and we have a system of equations here.

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:13,571
The first equation is 2y=x+7 and the second equation here is x=y-4.

3
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:16,638
So what we want to do when we say substitution is we want to

4
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:19,448
substitute one of the variables with an expression so that we

5
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:22,410
have an equation in only one variable then we can solve for it.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,462
So let me show you what I'm talking about. Let me write this first degree equation.

7
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:29,253
2y=x+7.

8
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:36,173
And we have the second equation over her, that x=y-4.

9
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:40,671
So if we are looking for an x and y that satisfy both constraints, what we can see is, well look,

10
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:43,520
if the x and the y's have to satisfy both restraints,

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,188
both of these restraints have to be true. So x must be equal to y-4.

12
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:52,103
So anywhere in this top equation where we see an x

13
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:59,756
we say, "Well look, that x by the second constraint has to be equal to y-4.

14
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:05,163
So everywhere we see an x, we can substitute it by a y-4.

15
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:09,843
So let's do that. So if we substitute y-4 for x in this top equation,

16
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:14,383
the top equation becomes 2y is equal to-- instead of an x,

17
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:23,683
the second constraint tells us that x needs to be equal to y-4. So instead of an x, we'll have a y-4.

18
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:27,614
And then we have a plus seven.

19
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:32,780
All I did here was I substituted y-4 for x.

20
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,169
The second constraint tells us that we need to do it.

21
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:39,244
y-4 needs to be equal to x, or x needs to be equal to y-4.

22
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:42,304
The value here is now we have an equation.

23
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:46,149
One equation with one variable; we can just solve for y.

24
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:54,896
So we get 2y=y, and then we have minus 4 plus 7 so y+3,

25
00:01:54,896 --> 00:02:00,594
we can subtract y from both sides of this equation.

26
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:03,718
The left hand side -- 2y-y is just y.

27
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,036
y is equal to-- these cancel out; y is equal to three.

28
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:12,022
And then we can go back and substitute into either of these equations and solve for x.

29
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:13,666
This is easier right over here,

30
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,452
so let's substitute right over here.

31
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:17,270
x needs to be equal to y-4.

32
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:28,697
So we can say that x is equal to 3-4, which is equal to -1.

33
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:37,172
So the solution to this system is x=-1, and y=3.

34
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:39,778
And you can verify that this works in this top equation right over here.

35
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:46,722
2*3 is 6, which is indeed equal to -1+7.

36
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:49,329
Now I want to show you that over here we substituted.

37
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,633
We had an expression or we had an equation

38
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,636
that explicitly solved for x so we were able to substitute the x's.

39
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:57,740
What I want to show you is that we could have done it the other way around.

40
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,179
We could have solved for y and then substituted for the y's.

41
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,013
So let's do that. We could have substituted

42
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:06,131
from one constraint into the other constraint or vice-versa.

43
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,532
Either way, we would have gotten the same exact answer.

44
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:12,655
So instead of saying that x=y-4, in that second equation,

45
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:21,175
if we add 4 to both sides of this equation, we get x+4=y.

46
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:24,111
This and this is the exact same constraint.

47
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:27,763
I just added four to both sides to get this constraint over here.

48
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:31,170
And now since we've solved the equation explicitly for y,

49
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,304
we can use the first constraint-- the first equation--

50
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:40,234
and everywhere we see y, we can substitute it with x+4.

51
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:43,813
So it's 2 times--instead of 2 times y-- we can write

52
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:47,775
2(x+4).

53
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:52,084
2(x+4)=x+7.

54
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:59,810
We can distribute this two, so we get 2x+8=x+7.

55
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,668
We can subtract x from both sides of this equation,

56
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:09,102
and we can subtract 8 from both sides of this equation. Subtract 8.

57
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:13,289
The left hand side, that cancels out. We're just left with an x.

58
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:18,326
On the right hand side, that cancels out, and we are left with a -1.

59
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:22,500
Then, we can substitute back over here. We have y=x+4,

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,749
or so y=-1+4, which is equal to 3.

61
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:30,742
So once again we got the same answer,

62
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:33,754
even though this time we substituted for y

63
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:35,730
instead of substituting for x.

64
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,338
Hopefully you find that interesting.
