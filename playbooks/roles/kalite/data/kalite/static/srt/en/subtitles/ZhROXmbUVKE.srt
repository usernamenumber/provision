00:00:01,037 --> 00:00:03,735
PROBLEM: What was the translation applied to move

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:07,353
the blue solid shape to the orange dashed shape?

3
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:11,853
So if you were to start with this blue solid shape,

4
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:13,567
and you wanted to shift it

5
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:15,486
to where the orange dotted shape is,

6
00:00:15,486 --> 00:00:16,751
how would you do that?

7
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:17,938
And the way that I like to think about it

8
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:19,291
is to just pick a point,

9
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,681
and see what had to happen to that point.

10
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:24,794
So this point at the top of this – I guess –

11
00:00:24,794 --> 00:00:26,325
this quadrilateral-looking thing,

12
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:27,659
it moved down here.

13
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:29,601
So it moved one to the left.

14
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,951
And it moved one down.

15
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,600
So we can denote that with a transformation.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,788
Moving one to the left is negative one (-1)

17
00:00:35,788 --> 00:00:37,186
in the horizontal direction.

18
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:37,946
If we were moving to the right,

19
00:00:37,946 --> 00:00:39,456
it would have been a positive one (+1).

20
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,497
And we moved one down, in the vertical direction.

21
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:45,050
And that is another negative one (-1).
