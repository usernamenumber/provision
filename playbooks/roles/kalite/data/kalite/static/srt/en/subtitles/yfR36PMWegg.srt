1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,009
I want to review a little
bit of what we

3
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:02,700
did in the last video.

4
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,520
And maybe draw a larger, more
spread-out diagram.

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,560
Because I think in the last
video I started to cram things

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,060
on the right-hand side here.

7
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,180
And this is a very important
concept, so I want to do it

8
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,650
nice and spread-out in a way
that we can breathe.

9
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,860
And maybe in the process I can
fill in some more blanks.

10
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,400
So let's go back and draw the
membrane of a thylakoid that's

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,220
sitting inside of a chloroplast.
I'm going to draw

12
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,225
this same membrane here.

13
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:30,440
So let me draw it nice
and spread out.

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,090
So let me draw a nice big
membrane like that.

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,520
That's the inside
of the membrane.

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,780
So you can imagine that this
loops around and that would

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,510
form the thylakoid.

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,630
On this side of the membrane
we have the lumen.

19
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,120
And on the outside of the
membrane we have the stroma,

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,840
where all the fluid that fills
up the choloroplast. So this

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,880
is the stroma right there.

22
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,830
And this is just a kind of
standard membrane that we see

23
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,010
in a lot of organelles.

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,510
But this is actually a membrane
within an organelle.

25
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,870
And then maybe there will be
a phospho-bilipid layer.

26
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,840
And I just say that, or I'm
pointing that out because I

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,950
want to think a little bit
about, in this video, how

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,240
protons can actually get
across this thing.

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,770
How do we use the energy from
these electrons going to lower

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,780
energy states to actually pump
protons across this membrane.

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,370
So you know when you have these
bilipid layers, your

32
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,510
outside is hydrophilic.

33
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,560
And of course, it's hydrophilic
because it

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,080
operates well in a polar
environment.

35
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,350
And then the insides are
non-polar or they're

36
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,880
hydrophobic and you
have these tales.

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,510
So I could draw the whole
membrane like that, but I

38
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,996
won't do that.

39
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:40,570
It will take me forever.

40
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,060
But let me draw some of the
components that I did in the

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,680
last video.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,400
So we have these complexes that

43
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,590
span across this membrane.

44
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,795
And the place we started
off with was the

45
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:52,380
photosystem II complex.

46
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,170
   

47
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,660
And then later on we have the
photosystem I complex.

48
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,380
   

49
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,699
And let me draw the ATP
synthase right here.

50
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,330
So ATP synthase also
spans across it.

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,060
Then it has little
motor part of it.

52
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,750
And the hydrogens go through and
it spins the motor and it

53
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,280
crams the phosphate groups
into the ADP to make ATP.

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,160
I'll talk about that
in a second.

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,890
But the first thing I want to
point out is, as I said in the

56
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,370
last video, the first place
where the electrons get

57
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,710
excited is in the chlorophyll
and photosystem II.

58
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,600
And then it gets less and less
and less excited, it gets

59
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,150
headed off from one complex
to another complex.

60
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,120
And eventually ends up
in photosystem I.

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,780
It gets excited again.

62
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,100
Then it gets handed off, handed
off, the whole time

63
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,890
that energy is being used to
transfer hydrogen protons from

64
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,800
the stroma into the lumen .

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,160
But the first question that I
would ask is, why is this

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,710
called photosystem II, while
this is called photosystem I

67
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,590
when we're starting over here?

68
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,780
And the reason is, this was
discovered first. Even though

69
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,520
in the light reaction it
actually comes into use, or it

70
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,750
comes into play, second.

71
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,780
This was discovered first.
That's why they call it

72
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,970
photosystem I.

73
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,890
But the reality is photosystem
II is where

74
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,800
everything starts from.

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,910
Now in some textbooks you'll
also see this written as P680.

76
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,420
And you'll see photosystem
I written as P700.

77
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,010
And these numbers come from the
wavelength of light that

78
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,100
is best absorbed by the
chlorophyll in these

79
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:47,590
photosystems. So 680 corresponds
to 680 nanometers.

80
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,490
That's the wavelength of light
that this absorbs the best.

81
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,390
700 corresponds to
700 nanometers.

82
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,710
That's the wavelength of
light it absorbs best.

83
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,730
Now what I want to do here is
draw a little diagram below

84
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,980
here to kind of talk
more about the

85
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,160
electron energy states.

86
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,750
I just kind of handwaved it a
little bit in the last video.

87
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,520
So I'm going to draw a
little diagram here.

88
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,440
   

89
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,540
And over here I'm going to write
the different things

90
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,020
that the electron can
be a part of.

91
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,930
So right now the electrons
can be part of H2O.

92
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,300
It could be part of
chlorophyll A.

93
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,500
   

94
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,190
It could be a part of-- I'll
talk more about this in a

95
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,540
little bit-- pheophytin And
then you have all of the

96
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,980
molecules or the complexes
it can become a part of.

97
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,060
I'll actually write
them down here.

98
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,770
So let me write.

99
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,100
I don't want to take
up too much space.

100
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:56,250
Plastoquinone and then there's
a cytochrome B6F complex.

101
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,500
I'll just write B6F.

102
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,270
   

103
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,520
Then you have plastocyanin .

104
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,370
   

105
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,610
I'll just write as PC.

106
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,270
You don't have to
memorize these.

107
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,030
You'll forget them in
a week if you do.

108
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,710
But unless you're studying
photosynthesis, then it might

109
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,650
make sense to memorize them.

110
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,570
And this is in photosystem II.

111
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,810
Then you have chlorophyll
in photosystem I.

112
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,710
   

113
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,380
And then you have some other,
you know you have ferredoxin

114
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,790
I'll just write FD for
ferredoxin Some other

115
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,640
molecules, you keep going and
then you have your eventual

116
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,650
electron acceptor NADP plus.

117
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,020
Which, once it accepts the
electron, becomes NADPH.

118
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,660
   

119
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,580
Now, electrons are very-- so
this is, if we go up that's a

120
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,060
high energy state, down it's
a low energy state.

121
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,940
So electrons are already
very comfortable.

122
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,210
   

123
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,700
in water.

124
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,780
And in chlorophyll A they're
even more comfortable.

125
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,080
At least this is
how I view it.

126
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,660
   

127
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,120
But left to its own devices,
this electron will never leave

128
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
chlorophyll A.

129
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,150
But we know what happens.

130
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,820
A photon comes in from 93
million miles away.

131
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,250
You could imagine photons as
little light packets or you

132
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,130
could view it as a light
wave. Either way.

133
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,700
And it excites-- not necessarily
directly the

134
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,810
chlorophyll A.

135
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,830
It might excite other antenna
chlorophyll or

136
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,140
other pigment molecules.

137
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,860
And then through resonance
energy, you can imagine them

138
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,600
vibrating, and it eventually
will excite the

139
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,240
photophorylation A directly.

140
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,210
Or excite the electrons in
chlorophyll A directly.

141
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,530
And this dude right
here gets excited.

142
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,050
Let me do that in a
brighter color.

143
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,670
So it goes to a high
energy state.

144
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,020
So the electron here is in
a high energy state.

145
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,200
Ignore that lumen right there.

146
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,040
It has nothing to do
with this electron.

147
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,030
And then it goes-- and actually
when it goes to the

148
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,840
high energy state, maybe I
should draw it like this, it

149
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,880
actually shows up
in pheophytin.

150
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,720
That is the primary
electron acceptor.

151
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,620
And it's actually a chlorophyll
A molecule.

152
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,910
Actually, let me show you
what a chlorophyll A

153
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,680
molecule looks like.

154
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,070
This is what a chlorophyll
A molecule looks like.

155
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,590
In general, it has a
hydrocarbon tail.

156
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,840
You see that right here.

157
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,900
   

158
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,510
And it has a porphyrin ring.

159
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,710
Or porphyrin head, I guess
you could call it.

160
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,610
   

161
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,380
This little group right here
is called a porphyrin.

162
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,240
   

163
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,520
And right in the center of
it, you have a magnesium.

164
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,860
That green right there, that's
a magnesium ion.

165
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,620
And when the photon comes in or
when the resonance energy

166
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,520
comes in from some of the
antenna molecules, electrons

167
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,840
in the double bond sitting
here in the

168
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,870
porphyrin head get excited.

169
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,810
Those are the electrons that
we're talking about.

170
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,590
And they get excited.

171
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,800
And the first electron acceptor
is this pheophytin

172
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,030
that I just talked about.

173
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,750
Pheophytin.

174
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,830
It actually looks just like a
chlorophyll, but it has no

175
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,470
magnesium ion in the middle.

176
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,110
And maybe I'm getting a little
bit into the weeds a little

177
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,850
bit too much.

178
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,960
But the pheophytin, you actually
see in this diagram

179
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,260
right here.

180
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,160
It's part of this photosystem
complex.

181
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,940
So the electron, you can
imagine, jumping from the

182
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,090
chlorophyll to the pheophytin
that does not have that

183
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,390
magnesium in the center.

184
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,220
And when it sits in the
pheophytin it's at a very,

185
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,430
very, very, very, high
energy state.

186
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,350
   

187
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,330
And then it keeps being
transferred from the

188
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:36,880
pheophytin.

189
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,860
It goes to the plastoquinone So
maybe we go to a slightly

190
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,390
lower energy state here.

191
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,650
We keep using the electron
in green.

192
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,230
Then it keeps going to a
slightly lower energy state in

193
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,750
the cytochrome B6F complex.

194
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,210
And then you have the
plastocyanin complex, lower

195
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,610
energy state.

196
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:02,430
And then eventually it goes into
photosystem I at an even

197
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,210
lower energy state.

198
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,560
Maybe slightly higher than the
energy state that it was

199
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,470
originally in the chlorophyll A
molecule in photosystem II.

200
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,350
Another photon or another set
of photons comes and hits

201
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,290
photosystem I.

202
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,780
Maybe its antenna molecules,
through resonance energy, that

203
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,530
excites the electron.

204
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,380
It might directly hit the
chlorophyll in photosystem in

205
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,010
its reaction center.

206
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,510
And then this gets
excited again.

207
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,260
   

208
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,350
And so once again we have an
electron with a high potential

209
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,720
that can keep going to, from one
molecule to another as it

210
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,070
gets more and more
comfortable.

211
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,640
And this releases energy that
can drive the proton pump.

212
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,110
And it eventually ends
up in the NADPH.

213
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,120
At a fairly high level
of energy still.

214
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,580
This electron can still be
transferred to other things

215
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,510
and release energy.

216
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,610
And we'll see that when we
talk about the light

217
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,180
independent reactions.

218
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,010
Now the whole point of me
showing you this is, I wanted

219
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,810
to kind of depict graphically
that the electron is starting

220
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,000
off at a pretty low
energy state.

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,430
And the only way this happens
is by energy from light.

222
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,140
This would not happen
on its own.

223
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,880
Going from a low energy state
to a higher energy state.

224
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,320
And I touched on in the last
video, you have this electron

225
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,410
going here and it gets
transferred from one molecule

226
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,150
to another.

227
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,090
Gets excited again, then keeps
going all the way, eventually

228
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,650
being accepted by the NAD
plus to become NADPH.

229
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,820
And you're like, where
did that H come from?

230
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,590
You could say, well that
H is a proton.

231
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,160
It gets that electron and then
they merge together and you

232
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,340
have NADPH.

233
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,050
But either way.

234
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,740
But the question is, what
replaces this electron?

235
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,060
And that's where that amazing
thing that I talked about in

236
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,420
the last video happens.

237
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,210
Water gets oxidized.

238
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,060
Oxidizing is losing electrons.

239
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,670
OIL RIG.

240
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:52,110
So water gets oxidized by
the water oxidation

241
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,890
on photosystem II.

242
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,210
And that electron ends up and
replaces the electron in the

243
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:58,830
chlorophyll.

244
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,910
So once again, that's an amazing
idea, that you're

245
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,730
oxidizing oxygen.

246
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,410
So the net effect of what
happens is, is you're using

247
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,610
energy, using this photon
energy right here, to

248
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,110
essentially strip electrons
off of water.

249
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,510
And as you know, when it's on
water it's spending most of

250
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,700
its time on the oxygen.

251
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,770
So it essentially strips
electrons off of oxygen and

252
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,710
put them in a higher energy
state and have

253
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,360
them end up on NADPH.

254
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,220
And in the process, it
had gone to an even

255
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,290
higher energy state.

256
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,200
And then as it goes down to
NADPH, you are pumping protons

257
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,430
across the membrane.

258
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,330
We learned in the last video,
through chemiosmosis,

259
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,470
eventually goes through the ATP
synthase channel, turns

260
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,680
around this part of this protein
complex or enzyme

261
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,460
complex and actually
generates ATP.

262
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,070
ATP from ADP and phosphate
groups.

263
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,740
And in the electron transport
chain video, when I talk about

264
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,680
cellular respiration, I give a
visual concept of how this

265
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,630
actually might happen.

266
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,470
How you could, as these go
through, you actually can jam

267
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,450
together the ATP and the ADP.

268
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,680
So that's another question in
my head is, we talk about

269
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,600
these electrons going from
one molecule to another.

270
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,780
But how does that actually
pump hydrogen through?

271
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,210
And I'm just going to do a very
gross oversimplification.

272
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,070
I'm sure it's much more
complicated in

273
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,470
actual plant cells.

274
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:31,140
But you could imagine that we
have our pheophytin right here

275
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,760
that has that electron
on it right there.

276
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,400
Maybe it has its electron
right there.

277
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,430
This is a gross
oversimplification.

278
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,130
And then you have your
plastoquinone right here.

279
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,940
   

280
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,520
That's the next acceptor.

281
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,020
Now maybe on this protein
complex right there, the point

282
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,350
that wants to accept the
electron is right there.

283
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,970
And let's say that there's
another point on it that can

284
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,170
accept a hydrogen.

285
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,170
Maybe it accepts a hydrogen
proton there.

286
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,910
So you can imagine when it's on
this side of the membrane,

287
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,130
a hydrogen can become attached
right there.

288
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,000
And this guy will want to
be attracted to that.

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,720
So he'll rotate around.

290
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,860
So you can imagine this-- if
this is kind of a wheel-- this

291
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,530
attraction.

292
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,660
Because the electron wants to
go into a lower energy state

293
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,370
right here.

294
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,970
It'll rotate around.

295
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,950
That'll allow, essentially, this
hydrogen as it rotates.

296
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,820
As this molecule, as this
protein rotates around this

297
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,050
hydrogen will be able to
cross the barrier.

298
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,290
And then once this guy and
that guy meet, then the

299
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,750
hydrogen will be on
the other side.

300
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,940
And so it can freely
go away again.

301
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,420
So that's, at least in my
head, how I imagine the

302
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,680
electrons going from a high
energy state to a lower energy

303
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,250
state, how that can actually
drive a reaction.

304
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,950
Remember, the electrons
want to do this.

305
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,760
So they'll attract the different
parts of the

306
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,920
molecules together.

307
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,260
And as those molecules turn and
rotate and move, that can

308
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,140
help facilitate hydrogen going
from the stroma, the outside

309
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,440
of the thylakoid, to the inside
of the thylakoid.

310
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,270
That will drive the chemiosmosis
later on.

311
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,310
Now there's one other point
I want to touch on here.

312
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,590
Everything I've described so
far, we started with an

313
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,020
electron in water.

314
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,880
And obviously when water loses
its hydrogens, it loses both

315
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,760
the hydrogen protons and
electrons associated with it.

316
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,710
You end up with just water.

317
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,420
So you start off with hydrogens
and then you end up

318
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,320
with just O2.

319
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,670
And then the hydrogen protons--
the electron got

320
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,730
taken up by the chlorophyll.

321
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,070
When you start off with that,
we've seen already that you

322
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,220
end up with the electron
sitting in NADPH.

323
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,400
The electron sitting
out here in NADPH.

324
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,955
At some point you have NAD
as the final acceptor.

325
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:54,300
Let me do it in the
right color.

326
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,600
You have NAD plus as
the final acceptor.

327
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,850
And it becomes NADPH.

328
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,070
   

329
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,820
You can imagine it accepts
maybe a hydrogen

330
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,030
proton from out here.

331
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,570
It accepts the electron from
this electron transport chain

332
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,990
in photosynthesis.

333
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,570
And it becomes NADPH and that
travels in the stroma, which

334
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,230
is where the dark reactions
occur that actually produce

335
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,340
the carbohydrate.

336
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,710
But this idea of an electron
going from water to NADPH,

337
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:39,710
this is called non-cyclic
photophosphorylation And it's

338
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,160
called non-cyclic because you're
not reusing the same

339
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,610
electrons over and over again.

340
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,705
The electrons start off, and
depending how you view it, in

341
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:47,700
the chlorophyll or the water.

342
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,280
And they end up in the NADPH.

343
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,640
Now there's another type of
photophosphorylation and you

344
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,360
might guess what it's called.

345
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,740
It's called cyclic.

346
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,470
Cyclic photophosphorylation
We'll see when we study the

347
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,280
dark cycles or the Calvin cycle
or the dark reactions or

348
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,720
the light independent
reactions, that it

349
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,960
uses a lot of ATP.

350
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,420
Actually ATP in disproportion
to the

351
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,290
amount of NADPH it uses.

352
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,140
It uses both, but it
uses a ton of ATP.

353
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:24,730
So cyclic phosphorylation only
produces ATP and actually does

354
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,370
not oxidize water.

355
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,660
So what happens in that
situation is this electron,

356
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,530
after it gets activated or
after it gets excited in

357
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,550
photosystem I, it's the
electron, it eventually ends

358
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,470
up-- instead of at NADPH, it
ends up at photosystem II.

359
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,420
So instead of this guy having
to be replaced by electrons

360
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,990
from water, this guy, in cyclic
photophosphorylation

361
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,390
ends up-- well, maybe I should
do it from here-- ends up

362
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,980
getting replaced by the
original electrons.

363
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,155
It gets excited here.

364
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:59,810
It goes from molecule to
molecule, lower energy states,

365
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,150
hydrogen gets pumped
into the lumen.

366
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,040
Gets excited again in
photosystem I and it enters

367
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,490
lower and lower energy states.

368
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,050
But then ends up again
in photosystem II.

369
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,319
That is cyclic
photophosphorylation.

370
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,140
So you can imagine in this
situation, since the electron

371
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,190
never ends up at NAD plus, you
don't end up producing NADPH.

372
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:24,010
And since you're replacing
this electron from the

373
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,230
photosynthesis or from the
electron transport chain

374
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,110
directly, you don't
have to strip the

375
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,960
electrons off of the water.

376
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,900
So you're not going to
produce your oxygen.

377
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,360
So, in this situation--
so this non-cyclic

378
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,620
phosphorylation, which
is kind of what most

379
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,050
photophosphorylation, is what
most people associate with

380
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:48,030
photophosphorylation, this
produces O2 and NADPH.

381
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,160
   

382
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,470
And of course it produces ATP.

383
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,320
While cyclic
photophosphorylation, because

384
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,890
it doesn't have to strip
electrons off of water and the

385
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:07,150
electrons don't end up at NADPH,
only produces ATP.

386
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,600
So I think we now have a very
good understanding, hopefully,

387
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,020
of the light reactions
in photosynthesis.

388
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,190
We're now ready to take
the products of this.

389
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,810
Now let's remember what
the products were.

390
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,660
Well, the oxygen just
gets eliminated.

391
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,140
We don't need the
oxygen anymore.

392
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,960
But that goes into the
atmosphere and you and I can

393
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,400
breathe that and we can use that
for cellular respiration.

394
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,030
But in the photosynthesis
context, we've now generated a

395
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,430
bunch of ATP.

396
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,610
And now we have a
bunch of NADPH.

397
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,750
And we can use that in
conjunction with carbon

398
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:44,240
dioxide to produce actual
carbohydrates in the stroma.

399
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,830
Outside the thylakoids, but
we're still inside of the

400
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,500
chloroplast. And I'll cover
that in the next video.
