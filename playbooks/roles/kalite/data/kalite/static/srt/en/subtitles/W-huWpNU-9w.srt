1
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:22,781
(music playing)

2
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:24,866
We're on the fifth floor of the Museum of Modern Art

3
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:30,656
and we're looking at Matisse's painting from 1911 called The Red Studio,

4
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:36,122
an oddly empty painting, but not surprisingly, a very red painting.

5
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:38,785
Given the title.

6
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:44,044
And red is normally a color that might be kind of scary or violent,

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,006
but it doesn't feel so here, at all.

8
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:47,958
No, and when you see the painting here in person,

9
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,161
the red is really kind of a deep red, right?

10
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,524
Almost a dark red.

11
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:55,306
The paintings inside it are bright, and these are Matisse's paintings.

12
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:58,025
That's true, and then there's no sense of violence or fear at all.

13
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:02,285
In fact, it feels very contemplative, and quiet, actually.

14
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:07,469
Well, it's his studio, right? And he built this in Issy, in a suburb of Paris, beside his house,

15
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,109
and this is his private space, and these his, you know, the world that he inhabits.

16
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,152
I think in some ways it's very much his interior world.

17
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:20,990
And he's chosen to make it look quiet, and like an interior, contemplative space,

18
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,776
where certain things stand out, and other things recede,

19
00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:32,176
and maybe he's telling us something about what's important to him in this personal artistic space.

20
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,495
of his own consciousness.

21
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:39,587
I think that's right. There isn't any sort of front-and-center that's really dominant in this painting.

22
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:42,256
It's a lot of things, in a sense, that we can choose from.

23
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:44,574
Right, it's almost like he's giving us a little menu.

24
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:47,475
Without a centralized composition.

25
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,259
Maybe this is what it feels like in Matisse's head,

26
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,243
these little isolated items that come together in this one space,

27
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:59,553
but without a real focal point, our eye moves from the lower left, up and around, to the lower right.

28
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,457
Actually following the clock, right?

29
00:02:01,457 --> 00:02:03,556
That's true, but the clock has no hands.

30
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:08,356
That's true, you're right, but I do kind of look at the painting in a kind of clockwise motion.

31
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:15,640
I start in the lower left and I do, I wrap myself around, looking at these paintings and the other things that actually have color in them in the canvas.

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,559
There's that cutting of nasturtium in the vase on the table in the foreground.

33
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:26,359
Right, and it looks like some crayons, maybe? Some Cray-Pas or something like that, in the lower right corner of the table.

34
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:27,378
And a plate,

35
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:29,473
That he had painted, it looks like, right?

36
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:32,804
And it looks like most of what we have here are actual works of art

37
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:35,559
Or the things that he uses to make art.

38
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:42,522
Like the crayons that you pointed out, and I think that's a vase of brushes perhaps in the background, on the bureau.

39
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:44,669
The chair is also kind of stands out.

40
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:50,169
Yeah, the chair is always sort of funny for Matisse, because he had made that comment that he got a lot of grief for, ultimately.

41
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:56,044
About an armchair, and art being something comfortable like an armchair.

42
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:59,388
And there is something I think that is very restive here, it's true.

43
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:06,525
You can almost, when you think about Matisse's paintings, you think about a nude, you can almost imagine a nude Odalisque, or a semi-nude Odalisque in that chair.

44
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:12,570
And there is an Odalisque, of sorts, if you look directly above the chair, there's that brown figure

45
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:20,394
which is wonderfullly pushed over, leaning, which is an acutal sculpture that Matisse had done just a couple of years earlier, called Serpentine.

46
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:23,000
And we have three nudes in the upper right.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,992
We have, it looks like a portrait above the dresser, and a still life above the dresser. That's the Sailor, actually.

48
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:34,857
And then we have another image of nudes leaning against the dresser in the back.

49
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:37,776
And we have another nude in the chair. The large pink one.

50
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:45,629
Now the large pink one, I remember reading, and this is interesting, that this was a painting that Matisse actually destroyed, soon after this painting The Red Studio was made.

51
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:53,287
And this is actually in some ways, I think, the best quality reproduction we have of its original colors, unless Matisse was revising it.

52
00:03:53,287 --> 00:04:01,378
Because he often did that, he often in his paintings included other paintings and actually created derivations of those paintings in the new paintings.

53
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:07,528
The artwork stands out, and the furniture is almost like a ghost in this space.

54
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:12,955
It's like nature, the nude, art, are the things that emerge.

55
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:21,142
And those are one of a kind for Matisse. I don't think he so much separates art and nature, and the female nude, especially.

56
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:27,228
I think those are, in a sense, the same thing, they're synonyms. It's all about sensuality, visual sensuality, it's true.

57
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:38,224
So this painting is all about that sensuality and then it's also got these modern interpretations that are pushed on top of it, which are actually very analytic, and very strict.

58
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:39,674
What kind of interpretations do you mean?

59
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:44,952
Well, a moment ago you were talking about the way in which all the furniture looks as if it's almost ghostlike.

60
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:52,191
And if you look at it closely (let's get up closer), it's because those white lines are not actually white.

61
00:04:52,191 --> 00:05:03,777
There's yellow, and pale blue, and dark blue, and green, and in fact, that's not drawn on top of the red. The red is actually drawn up to those lines.

62
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:08,420
And those lines are actually the paint that exists below the plane of the red, which is on top.

63
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:15,039
It's sometimes referred to as a reserve line, and that's not artistically very difficult to do, but it's some trouble.

64
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,391
And it was a very specific choice.

65
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:28,408
And it also indicates that he really must have thought this whole thing through, before he did it, which sort of belies the feeling of the painting itself, which feels more spontaneous.

66
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:32,726
I think that was a real trait for Matisse. I think he worked very hard to make things look very easy.

67
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:43,905
So then the question emerges, why all that effort to make the lines look as though -- they look on top, but they're really underneath. Why would he have done such a thing?

68
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:53,255
Well, I have my thoughts about this, and actually instead of looking at those reserve lines, first, I want to point out that in the upper right had corner of the painting,

69
00:05:53,255 --> 00:06:00,440
we're missing a vertical line that would designate the corner of the room. I'm sorry, the upper left hand corner.

70
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,137
Right, so actually the perspective space doesn't really make sense there, in the upper left.

71
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:12,244
No, it's sort of dismantled. In fact, I think this whole painting is, in large part, about the process of dismantling traditional linear perspective.

72
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:16,771
I mean, look at the chair in the lower right corner, the chair with the tall back.

73
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:18,278
That doesn't make much sense at all.

74
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:23,008
No, as it moves away from us, the seat actually gets wider. It's in reverse of traditional perspective.

75
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,272
And the table here, the table is awkward, you sort of have multiple viewpoints,

76
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,744
sort of like we're looking down at the table and across at the room at the same time.

77
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:36,557
So, to go back to this reserve line issue, one of the issues that I know has been discussed in relationship to this painting,

78
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:46,341
is that the reserve line is a way of further dismantling our expectations of linear perspective, or our desire to construct illusionistic space within this canvas.

79
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:53,405
And the way it does that, and this is a little bit tricky, is to take what's underneath and put it on top.

80
00:06:53,405 --> 00:07:03,408
The red, if you look at it as the floor, for a moment, has got to be in back of the table, or these chairs.

81
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:11,884
And yet the table and chairs, however, are actually constructed of paint that is behind, in back of -- literally and physically in back of -- that red.

82
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:17,159
So the ground is actually making the figures, and the figures are actually constructing the ground.

83
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:21,456
By figures you mean the chair and the table, the objects in the painting.

84
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:28,591
Exactly. The objects should be in front of the floor. But in fact, they're constructed out of paint that is behind the floor.

85
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:35,880
And so there is this kind of funny scrambling of the way the painting is traditionally made or a drawing is traditionally made.

86
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:43,106
What's amazing to me when I think about this is how it took so much effort to dismantle this tradition,

87
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:49,522
although when you think about it, the tradition is -- by the time we get to Matisse -- 700, 600 years old.

88
00:07:49,522 --> 00:07:58,475
And so it's not going to take one or two or three years, or a couple of artists, to dismantle a 600-year-old tradition

89
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:08,376
of conceiving of art as something that is like a window into a realistic world, and linear perspective aids the creation of that realistic world.

90
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:12,943
It's going to take Cezanne, it's going to take Gaugin, it's going to take Van Gogh, it's going to take Matisse, it's going to take Picasso

91
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:19,223
And it still doesn't work, because look, when I'm looking at this, even though I see that there's no line in the upper left,

92
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:24,840
even though the entire canvas is painted red virtually, even though we have this reverse of the figure-ground relationship,

93
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:35,345
even though the linear perspective of the seat of the chair in the lower right is backwards, even though we have all of these things corrupting, I still see this space.

94
00:08:35,345 --> 00:08:40,074
So why did he do this? Is he playing with us? Is he saying, here's some space, but no it's not there?

95
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:48,324
I think he wants us to become aware of the mechanics of what an artist does, and what that process is.

96
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:50,589
I think in some ways this is very modernist.

97
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,342
And what about our expectations?

98
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:56,602
I think that's critical here. And now he IS playing with us.
