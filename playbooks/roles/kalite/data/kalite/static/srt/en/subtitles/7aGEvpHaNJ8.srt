1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,770
So given this diagram, we have to figure out what the length

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,410
of CF right over here is, and you might already guess

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,830
that this will have to do something to similar triangles

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,280
at least it looks that triangle CFE is similar to ABE

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,450
the intuition there is kind of embedded inside of it

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,490
and it also looks like triangle CFB

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,170
is going to be similar to triangle DEB

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,330
but once again we're gonna prove that to ourselves,

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,130
and then maybe we can deal with all the ratios of the different size

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,640
to CF right over here,

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,150
and actually figure out what CF is going to be

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,740
So first let's prove to ourselves

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,730
that these are definitely are similar triangles

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,150
So you have this 90 degree angle an ABE

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,840
and you know this 90 degree angle and CFE,

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,920
if we can prove just one other angle is,

17
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,150
or one other set of corresponding angles

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,160
is congruent in both and we've proved that they're similar

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,860
And there we can either show that,

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,320
they both show, they both share this angle over here

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,180
Angle is CEF is the same as angle AEB

22
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,110
So we've shown two angles, two corresponding angles

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,680
in these triangles, this is an angle on both triangles,

24
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,970
they are congruent, so these triangles are going to be similar

25
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,600
You can also show that this line, probably this line,

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,310
because obviously these two angles are the same

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,770
And so these angles will also be the same,

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,800
so they're definitely similar triangles

29
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,310
So let's just write that down, get it out of the way

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:38,920
We know that triangle ABE, ABE is similar with triangle CFE,

31
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,760
you wanna make sure get it in the right order

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,850
F is where the 90 degree angle is,

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,450
B is where the 90 degree angle is,

34
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,800
and so an E is where this orange angle is

35
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,410
So CFE, it's similar triangles CFE

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,220
Now let's see if we can figure out the same statement

37
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,260
going the other way, looking at triangle DEB

38
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,380
So once again, once again, you have 90 degree angle here

39
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,150
This is 90 and this is definitely gonna be 90 as well

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,870
You have a 90 degree angle here at CFB

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,990
You have a 90 degree angle at DEF or DEB,

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,160
however you wanna call it

43
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,240
So they have one set of corresponding angles that are congruent

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,900
And the you'll also see that they both share this angle right over here

45
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,680
On the small triangle, I'm not looking at,

46
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,820
I'm not looking at this triangle right over here

47
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,130
it's supposed to be the on the right

48
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,710
So they bout share this angle right over here

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,260
DBE, angle DBE is the same as angle CBF

50
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,900
So I've shown you already that we have this angle

51
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,730
is congruent to this angle and we have this angle is a part of both

52
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,950
so it's obviously congruent to itself

53
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,030
So we have two angles, two corresponding angles

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,540
that are congruent to each other

55
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,460
So we know that this larger triangle over here

56
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,630
is similar to this smaller triangle over there

57
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,220
So let me write this down, so we also know,

58
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,240
let's scroll over to the right a little bit,

59
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:10,920
we also know that triangle, triangle DEB, triangle DEB is similar,

60
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:18,880
triangle DEB is similar to triangle CFB, to triangle CFB

61
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,740
Now what can we do from here?

62
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,980
What we know that the ratios of corresponding sites,

63
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,220
one of those, each of those similar triangles

64
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,500
are going to have to be the same

65
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,120
But we only have one side of one of the triangles,

66
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,140
so in the case of ABE and CFE we're only given one side

67
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,530
In the case of DEB and CFB we've only been given one side over here

68
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
it doesn't seem to be a lot to work with

69
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,260
And this is why it's slightly more a challenging problem here

70
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,870
let's just go ahead and see if we can assume one of the sides

71
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,870
and actually, maybe the sides

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,720
let's just assume that this length right over here

73
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,480
let's just assume that BE is equal to Y

74
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,140
So let me just write this down

75
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,240
This whole length is going to be equal to Y

76
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,140
Because at least this give us something to work with

77
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,560
And Y is shared by both ABE and DEB

78
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,450
the shorter, the smaller triangles over there,

79
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:24,430
so maybe we'll call this length, we'll call BF X, let's call BF X

80
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,660
and then let's call FE, while this is X and this is Y minus X

81
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,830
We've introduced a bunch of,

82
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,580
We've introduced a bunch of variables here

83
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,180
but maybe with all the proportionalities of things,

84
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,470
just maybe things will work out,

85
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,420
or at least we can have a little more sense

86
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,440
where we can go with this actual problem

87
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,980
But now we can start dealing with,

88
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,150
we can now start dealing with the similar triangles

89
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,740
For example we wanna figure out what CF,

90
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,550
we wanna figure out what CF is

91
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,260
We now know that for these two triangles,

92
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,470
the ratio of the corresponding sides are going to be constant,

93
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,580
so for example the ratio between CF and 9,

94
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,720
the corresponding sides, the ratio between CF and 9

95
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:11,200
has got to be equal to the ratio between Y minus X, Y minus X,

96
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,870
that's that side right there, Y minus X

97
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,000
in the corresponding side of the larger triangle

98
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,220
While the corresponding side of the large triangle

99
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:24,080
is this entire length and that entire length over there is Y

100
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,140
So it's equal to Y minus X over Y

101
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,750
So we can simplify this a little bit,

102
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,080
While I'll hold off for a second,

103
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,510
lets see if we can do something similar with this thing on the right

104
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,670
not looking at triangle CFE anymore

105
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,560
so we have CF over DE is going to be equal to,

106
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:00,300
so CF over DE is going to be equal to X is going to be equal to,

107
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,750
It's going to be equal to X over, it's going to be equal to X over

108
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,870
this entire base right over here, this entire BE,

109
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,500
so which is know is over Y

110
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:22,670
And now this looks interesting because we have 3 unknowns

111
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,310
we have CF sorry we know what DE is already,

112
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,980
I could have written CF over 12

113
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,390
The ratio between CF and 12

114
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,910
is gong to be the ratio between X and Y

115
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,440
So we have 3 unknowns and 3 equations,

116
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,290
it seems it's hard to solve at first,

117
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,140
because its 1 unknown, another unknown,

118
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,460
another unknown and another unknown

119
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,990
But it looks like I can write this, right here,

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,580
this expression in terms of X over Y

121
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,060
and then we can do a substitution so that's why this is a little tricky

122
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,730
So this one right here we can rewrite as CF,

123
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,750
let me do that same green color, we can rewrite is as CF over 9

124
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,810
is equal to Y minus X over Y is the same thing

125
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:10,790
as Y over Y minus X over Y or 1 minus X over Y

126
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,060
All I did is essentially, I could you can say distributed

127
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,070
then 1 over Y times both of these terms

128
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,330
Y over Y minus X over Y, 1 over or 1 minus X minus Y

129
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,820
And this is usual because we already know what Y is equal to

130
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,870
X, sorry, X over Y is equal to

131
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,840
We already know that X over Y is equal to CF over 12

132
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,810
So this right over here, I can replace with this CF over 12,

133
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,360
so then we get, this is the homestretch here,

134
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,300
CF which is what we care about,

135
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,580
CF over 9 is equal 1 minus CF over 12

136
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,780
And now we have one equation and one unknown

137
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,710
We should be able to solve this right over here,

138
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,290
so we can add CF to both sides

139
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,200
so you have CF over 9 plus CF over 12

140
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,760
is equal to one, we just have to find a common denominator here

141
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,370
I think 36 will do the trick

142
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,920
So 9 times 4 is 36, so if you have to multiple 9 times 4,

143
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,590
you have to multiply CF times 4 so you have 4 CF,

144
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,030
4 CF over 36 is the same thing as CF over 9 and then plus,

145
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,790
CF over 12 is the same thing as over 3 CF over 36

146
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,680
and this is going to be equal to 1,

147
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,890
and then we are left with 4 CF plus 3 CF is equal to 7

148
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,490
CF over 36 is equal to and to solve for CF,

149
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,670
we can multiply both sides and the reciprocal of 7 over 36

150
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,110
So 36 over 7, so 36 over 7 multiply both sides times that 36 over 7

151
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,590
This side thing is cancelled out and we are left with,

152
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,860
our final, we get our drum roll now, CF is equal to, CF,

153
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,430
all of this stuff is cancelled out,

154
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,840
CF is equal to 36, 1 times 36 over 7 or just 36 over 7

155
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,030
And this is a pretty cool problem,

156
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,840
because what it shows you is you have two things

157
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,800
let's see this thing is some kind of a pole or a stick

158
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,300
or the wall of building

159
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,750
Or who knows what it is

160
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,780
If this is 9 feet tall or 9 yards tall or 9 meters tall

161
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,190
and this over here, this other one 12 meters tall, or 12 yards,

162
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,730
whatever you want, units you wanna use it,

163
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,230
if you wanna drape a string, either of them,

164
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,760
to the base of the other, from the top of one of them to the base

165
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,240
of the other, regardless of how far apart these two things

166
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,590
are going to be we just said how far apart

167
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,350
regardless of how a part they are,

168
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,240
the place where those two strings

169
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,350
will intersect are going to 36 7 tie,

170
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,680
I guess 5 7 tie regardless of how far they are

171
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,000
So that's a pretty, I don't know,

172
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,220
I think that was a pretty cool problem
