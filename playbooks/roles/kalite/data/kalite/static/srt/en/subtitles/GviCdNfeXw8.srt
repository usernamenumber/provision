1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,000
All right, problem 42.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,110
So say for the system of equations given,

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,000
and this is the system of equations they give,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,040
they say x minus 4 is equal to z.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,300
They say y minus x is equal to 8,

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,030
and that 8 minus z is equal to t.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,000
So they say for the system equation, what is the value of z?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,280
So we're trying to figure out z in this.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,010
Statement number one: they tell us that x is equal to 7.

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,620
Well, if we know x is equal to 7,

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,060
we can solve for z right here

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,740
because x is 7 and 7 minus 4 is z,

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,250
so 7 minus 4 is 3, so z is equal to 3.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,230
That was pretty straightforward.

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,270
So one alone is sufficient just using this first equation

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,040
in the system.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,060
So let's see if two is of any use.

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,810
t is equal to 5. Well, this is an easy one, too.

19
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,170
You put t is equal to 5 right here

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,310
and then you could easily solve for z, right?

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,110
You get 8 minus z is equal to 5 and you can solve for it,

22
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,820
but I'm not even going to do it.

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,030
You just have to know that you can.

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,010
So this alone is sufficient as well.

25
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,130
So the answer is D.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,050
Each statement alone is sufficient.

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,000
Problem 43.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,190
Is x equal to 5?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,640
In statement number one,

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,900
they say x is greater than or equal to 5.

31
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,850
Well, that doesn't tell me whether x is equal to 5.

32
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,000
It just says it's greater than 5.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,100
Statement number two tells us x is less than or equal to 5.

34
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,020
Once again, that does not tell me whether x is 5,

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,290
but if I told you that both of these are true,

36
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,340
x is greater than or equal 5, and-- not or--

37
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,000
and x is less than or equal to 5,

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,520
well, actually, that still--

39
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,520
well, the only x that satisfies that equation,

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,090
that satisfies both of these, is 5, right?

41
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,310
I mean, you put 3 in, 3 will not satisfy this one.

42
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,000
If you put 7 in, 7 will not satisfy this one.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,280
So the only thing that satisfies this is 5,

44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,220
so you need both of these.

45
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:36,040
So the answer is both statements together are sufficient, C.

46
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,030
That one's confusing because it's so simple on some level.

47
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,090
44.

48
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,650
44. The table above shows that this--

49
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,330
let me see if I can draw this table.

50
00:02:51,310 --> 00:03:05,720
And they write R, S, T, U, and R, S, T, and U.

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,680
They have a bunch of things.

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,890
I don't even know what these are yet.

53
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,690
I haven't read the question,

54
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:30,010
but let's see, 0, y, x, 62, y, 0, 56, 75, x, 56, 0, 69.

55
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:39,350
And then 62-- that's a 6-- 62, 75, 69, and 0.

56
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,340
And what are they going to ask?

57
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,910
They're saying the table above shows the distance in

58
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,970
kilometers by the most direct route

59
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,820
between any two of the four cities.

60
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,610
For example, the distance between city R and city U is 62.

61
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,190
Or if you said between U and R,

62
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,540
it's going to be 62 as well, right?

63
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,470
That's the same thing.

64
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,390
Fair enough.

65
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,620
What is the value of x?

66
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,790
So the value of x is the distance between T and R.

67
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,000
Let me circle that.

68
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,030
They want to know what the value of x is.

69
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,370
It's the distance between T and R, so it's that one.

70
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,510
And another way to look at distance between T and R,

71
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,060
that's this one so, these are both x.

72
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,560
Fair enough.

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,510
OK.

74
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,010
So statement number one tells us, by the most direct route,

75
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,360
the distance between S and T,

76
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,920
so we could say the distance between S and T,

77
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,740
I'll just say it's line segment ST,

78
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,240
is equal to twice the distance between S and R.

79
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,090
It's equal to two times SR.

80
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,430
So let's see, do we know what SR is?

81
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,420
SR is equal to y, right?

82
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:56,030
And ST is equal to 56.

83
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,890
So 56 is equal to 2 times SR.

84
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,570
The distance between S and R is y, so it equals 2y.

85
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:11,000
And so we can solve for y. y is equal to 28.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,320
And we didn't have to solve it, but let's see.

87
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm just trying to see where this goes.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,590
But that still doesn't help me figure out

89
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,360
the distance between R and T.

90
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,050
That just tells me solve for y. y is 28.

91
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,020
Statement number two, see where this is going.

92
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,990
By the most direct route the distance between T and U

93
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,420
is 1.5 times the distance between R and T.

94
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,980
So the distance between R and T,this is the interesting thing

95
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,040
because R and T is x, right?

96
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,550
So they're saying the distance between T and U

97
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,930
is equal to 1.5 times x.

98
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,040
And what's this between T and U?

99
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,480
The distance between T and U is 69.

100
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,400
You don't even have to solve it.

101
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,660
You just know that you can usually solve for x

102
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,370
if you know statement number two.

103
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,000
So statement number two alone helps you figure out what x is.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,230
Statement number one is fairly useless.

105
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,230
So the answer is B.

106
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,090
Statement two alone is sufficient.

107
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,000
Let me draw a line here. I don't want to--

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,070
OK, problem number 45.

109
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,010
45. What is the value of the two-digit integer x?

110
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:44,030
So 2-dig integer x equals, who knows?

111
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,050
All right.

112
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,880
Statement number one: The sum of the two digits is 3.

113
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,400
So let's that x is equal to the number AB

114
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,480
where this is the tens digits and this is the ones digit.

115
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,090
So statement number one says the sum of the two digits is 3,

116
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,030
so A plus B is equal to 3.

117
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,320
Well, that doesn't help us. There's a lot of--

118
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,570
well, you know that these are going to be positive numbers,

119
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,510
but we don't know whether they're two different numbers.

120
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,030
Two: x is divisible by 3.

121
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,630
x is divisible at 3.

122
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,110
Well, I don't know if you learned that trick in school,

123
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,860
but any number that is divisible by 3,

124
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,430
the sum of their digits are also divisible by 3.

125
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,040
So once again,

126
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:38,010
that just means that A plus B is equal to some multiple of 3.

127
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,050
Well, if you keep adding them, they eventually add up.

128
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,020
So if you had a two digit number, so this is--

129
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,060
let's see. Let's think. Just A plus B is equal to 3.

130
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,320
This could be a couple of different things.

131
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,570
It could be a two-digit number.

132
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:57,810
It could be 30. It could be 1.

133
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,060
It could be 12. It could be 21.

134
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,780
I think those are all of the possibilities

135
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,070
that we can have just off of statement number one.

136
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,910
And x is divisible by three,

137
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,440
well, all of these are divisible by 3,

138
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,990
so really, both statements give you no information.

139
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,250
So the answer is E,

140
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,090
that both statements combined still give me nothing.

141
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,050
But all of these are possibilities.

142
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,690
And actually, this one leads to many,

143
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,100
many more possibilities that x is divisible by 3

144
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,010
because then you could have things like-- I don't know.

145
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,420
This would have been a valid number as well.

146
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,530
This would actually give a lot more.

147
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,610
This is a little bit more strict.

148
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,650
But anyway, either way, we can't figure out what x is.

149
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,400
It could be 30. It could be 12. It could be 21.

150
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,050
It could be anything.

151
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,060
All right. Problem 46.

152
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,620
What is the tenth digit in the decimal representation of a

153
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,310
certain number?

154
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,300
So the tenth,

155
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,010
that's the number right behind the decimal point.

156
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,100
So the number-- let's just call it x--

157
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,060
so statement number one says x is less than 1/3.

158
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,070
And two says that x is greater than 1/4.

159
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,000
So this is enough to figure out what the tenth digit is?

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,980
So what's the number that's less than 1/3?

161
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,200
Let me to think of a couple of them.

162
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,310
Well, 1/3 is like 0.333 repeating,

163
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:26,410
so if I just write 0.32 that satisfies one and it satisfies 2

164
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,060
right?

165
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,590
0.32 is greater than 1/4. But what's another--?

166
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,020
And then in this case, a tenth digit would be a 3, but let me

167
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,270
try to find another one that would satisfy these both.

168
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,060
Well, let's see, greater than 1/4, what about 0.26?

169
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,020
0.26 is definitely greater than 1/4

170
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,420
and is definitely less than 1/3,

171
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,120
but both of these have different tens.

172
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,870
One has a 2, one has a 3 there.

173
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,310
So even both statements combined still do not allow me

174
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,200
to solve the problem.

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,540
There's not enough information given.

176
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,970
So once again, E,

177
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,060
together I'm still not getting enough information.

178
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,950
Oh, I'm almost at 10 minutes.

179
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,020
Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.
