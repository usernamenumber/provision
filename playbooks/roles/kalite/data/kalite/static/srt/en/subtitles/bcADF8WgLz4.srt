1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,000
Problem 77.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,000
If Miss Smith's income was 20% more for 1991 than it was for

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,380
1990, how much was her income in 1991?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,400
Let's call it income 1991, is 20% more than 1990.

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:38,390
So that means 1.2 times income in 1990. I hope you get that.

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,640
If something is 20% more than something else,

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,250
it's going to be 1.2 times that.

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,020
12 is 20% more than 10. And 12 is 1.2 times 10.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,980
Or you could view it as income plus 20% of income,

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,820
which is 1.2 times income. Either way.

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,060
So let's see what they tell us.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,060
Well, what do we have to figure out?

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,870
OK, we were trying to figure out this,

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,030
income in 1991. Statement number one.

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,020
Miss Smith's income for the first six months of 1990 was

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,890
$17,500, and the income for the last six months of 1990

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,040
was $20,000.

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,820
So they're telling that she made $17,500 in the first six

19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,570
months of 1990, and her income for the last six months of

20
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,640
1990 was $20,000. Well,

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,020
they're essentially telling us the total income for 1990.

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,660
The first six months and the last six months.

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,000
There are 12 months in a year.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,050
So her total income for 1990 was $37,500.

25
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,160
That equals income for 1990.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,640
So clearly, if we know this is this, we just multiply that

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,020
times 1.2, and we get the income for 1991.

28
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,730
So this statement alone is sufficient.

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,070
Let's see what they give us for statement number two.

30
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:01,240
Miss Smith's income for 1991 was $7,500 greater than for 1990

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:11,000
So they say income of 1991 was $7,500, so it equals income

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,800
for 1990 plus $7,500. Well,

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,910
this alone does help us,because they've already given us this

34
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,490
So we have two linear equations, right?

35
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,640
This is one linear equation and two unknowns.

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,600
This is another linear equation and two unknowns.

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,000
So we have two linear equations and two unknowns.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,950
We can solve this.

39
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,390
Probably the easiest way is just to substitute,

40
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,590
depending on what you want to solve for.

41
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,690
But we've done that multiple times.

42
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,950
You could substitute 1.2 times 1990 here,

43
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,000
and then solve for it. Or you could do the other way.

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,780
You could divide by 1.2 here and then substitute it there.

45
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,000
But either way, this is trivial algebra, hopefully,

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
by this point, to solve.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,570
But this and this is definitely enough information

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:02:59,950
to solve the problem. So two equations with two unknowns.

49
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,880
And you can do that in your spare time if you don't

50
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,580
believe me.

51
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:16,020
So both statements alone are sufficient for this one. 78.

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,260
In the figure above-- so I think I have to draw.

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,550
This is the y-axis, and that's the x-axis.

54
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,050
And then they have a line. Let's see what I can do.

55
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,570
The line looks something like that.

56
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,550
And then they tell us-- what do they tell us?

57
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,000
This, of course, is y. This is x.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,540
And then they say this is P. And this right here is Q.

59
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,550
And then they draw this. They call this point right here R.

60
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:04,010
And they draw-- that's like that.And this Q is at point c, d.

61
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,060
And P is at point a, b.

62
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,880
And then they say, in the figure above, segments PR and

63
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,050
QR-- so let me draw that out a little bit better.

64
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,840
--are each parallel to one of the rectangular coordinate axes

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,030
OK, fair enough.

66
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,740
This is parallel to the y-axis, PR is parallel to the x-axis.

67
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,040
Fair enough. Is the ratio of the length of QR:PR equal to 1?

68
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,150
So is the ratio of QR:PR equal to 1?

69
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,680
So they want to know QR/PR, is that equal to 1?

70
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,470
And immediately this should trigger something from Algebra 1.

71
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,540
They're asking you, essentially,

72
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,380
is the slope of this line equal to 1? Right?

73
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,140
Is the ratio of QR:PR, so rise over run, is the slope of this

74
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,080
line equal to 1? So let's see what we can do.

75
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,000
And slope is just change in y over change in x.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,550
So what's this point, first of all?

77
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,320
You actually don't have to know anything about slope.

78
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't want to make you feel like you have to

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,020
memorize some formulas. What's this point going to be?

80
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,470
So it's going to be-- actually, let's do it even better.

81
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,220
What is the length of QR going to be?

82
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,000
I haven't looked at any of the data points right now.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,030
What is length of QR?

84
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,850
Well, it's going to be this height.

85
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,500
So it's this y, which is d, minus this y.

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,030
This y is going to be b, right?

87
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,930
Because all of this is y is equal to b, right here.

88
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,030
So QR is going to be equal to d minus b.

89
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:51,080
And PR is the length on the x-axis. It's going to be this x.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,370
What is this x? Well, this x is right here, c. x equal to c.

91
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,110
It's going to be this x minus this x.

92
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,050
Well, here, x is equal to a.

93
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,480
And so the ratio is equal to d minus b, over c minus a.

94
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,040
Which is,if you remember,the formula for the slope of a line.

95
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:22,280
You just take the y1 minus y2, over x1 minus x2.

96
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,030
But we didn't have to memorize that. It's intuition.

97
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,010
So the point right here R,See the x-coordinate is c and the y-coordinate is b.

98
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,600
So hopefully that gives you intuition.

99
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,670
Now let's look at the statements.

100
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,440
You wouldn't have to do that on the real GMAT.

101
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,020
That would all be a waste of time.

102
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,850
Statement number one tells us, c is equal to 3 and

103
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,830
d is equal to 4.

104
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,020
So that by itself, that just gives us the first part of this.

105
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,180
That doesn't help us figure out this entire ratio.

106
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,190
So this by itself isn't that useful.

107
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,020
Maybe in conjunction with what else they give us.

108
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,040
Statement two.

109
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,460
a is equal to minus 2, and b is equal to minus 1.

110
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,690
Well, if you used both of these statements together,

111
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,030
then we have everything here.

112
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:11,880
We have d, we have b, we have c, and we have a.

113
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,000
So we can solve it.

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,820
So both statements together are sufficient for knowing

115
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,220
whether the ratio of QR:PR is 1.

116
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,000
Or essentially, is the slope of this line equal to 1?

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,800
Next problem, 79.

118
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,280
While on a straight road, car x and car y are travelling at

119
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,660
different constant rates.

120
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,850
If car x is now 1 mile ahead of car y, how many minutes

121
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,000
from now will car x be 2 miles ahead of car y?

122
00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:03,050
So x is here. y is here. And they're going at constant rates.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,290
1 mile.

124
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,720
So they've been traveling for some amount of time and x is 1

125
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,390
mile ahead.

126
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,410
And they're saying how long is it going to be before x is--

127
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,570
how many minutes before x is 2 miles ahead?

128
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,830
And they're at constant rates.

129
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,730
So if they started off-- and let's just think about it-- if

130
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,680
they started off at the same point and it took 10 minutes

131
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,220
for x to get 1 mile ahead, it would take another 10 minutes

132
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,350
for it to get 2 miles. Well, that's how I'm thinking about.

133
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,090
Let's see what they give us for the statements.

134
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:33,010
Statement number one.Car x is traveling at 50 miles per hour,

135
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,800
and car y is travelling at 40 miles per hour.

136
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,850
Well, that seems to be pretty good information.

137
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,000
So essentially, car y is moving away from car x at what?

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,010
It's moving away 50 minus 40 miles per hour.

139
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,300
So from car y's point of view, car x is always pulling away

140
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,560
at 10 miles per hour. Right? Does that make sense?

141
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,680
If car x was going at 40 miles per hour,

142
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,380
you wouldn't be pulling away at all.

143
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,020
If it was going at 41 miles per hour,

144
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,500
it'd be pulling away at a increment of 1 mile per hour.

145
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,880
And as long as we're not approaching the speed of light,

146
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,500
we can assume Newtonian classical physics,

147
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,670
and we could just take the difference between the two.

148
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,430
So how long does it take for it to pull away another mile?

149
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,010
Well, if you're going 10 miles per hour, relative to

150
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,370
something else, how many minutes does it take to go a mile?

151
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,800
Well, one, you know you can figure that out.

152
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,070
But let me figure that out for you.

153
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,030
So you know distance is equal to rate times time.

154
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,610
So if your distance you want to know is 1 mile,

155
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:49,640
and your rate is equal to 10 miles per hour, times time,

156
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,630
what's the time going to be equal to?

157
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:59,070
Time is going to be equal to 1/10 of an hour, or 6 minutes.

158
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,010
So that's the answer to number one. One alone is sufficient.

159
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,110
Or the answer to number 79, one alone is sufficient.

160
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,550
Let's see what they give us for number two. Statement two.

161
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:14,710
3 minutes ago, car x was 1/2 mile ahead of car y. OK.

162
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:22,030
So 3 minutes ago, the state of affairs was this: y was here,

163
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:28,000
x was here. And it was a 1/2 mile difference.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,100
So what does that tell us?

165
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,000
That's actually pretty good information too.

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,060
3 minutes ago, car x was 1/2 mile ahead of car y.

167
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,130
Now car x is 1 mile ahead.

168
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:53,510
So in 3 minutes, x pulls away by 1/2 a mile, right?

169
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,080
And they're going at constant velocities.

170
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,770
So the relative velocities between the two don't change.

171
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,870
So if it takes 3 minutes for x to pull away by 1/2 a mile,

172
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,790
it would take 6 minutes for x to pull away by a mile, right?

173
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,730
You just multiply them by 2.

174
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,130
They're all going at the same constant velocity.

175
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:17,070
So in 6 minutes, x pulls away by 1 mile.

176
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,410
And that's actually what they're asking.

177
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,540
Because they say how many more minutes does it take x to pull

178
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,530
away by another mile?

179
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,000
They've probably been traveling for 6 minutes already, and

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,450
then in another 6 minutes x would pull away by another mile.

181
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,760
So two alone is also sufficient. So each of them

182
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,130
independently are good enough to answer this question.

183
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,020
