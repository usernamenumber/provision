1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:02,740
In the last video we figured out that

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,467
given a takeoff velocity of 280 km/h

3
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,605
and if we have a positive value for any of these vectors

4
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:12,800
we assume that it's in the forward direction for the runway

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,533
Given this takeoff velocity, and a constant acceleration of 1 m/s^2

6
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:28,292
we figured out that it would take an Airbus A380 about 78 seconds to take off

7
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:30,267
What I want to figure out in this video

8
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:31,881
is that given all these numbers

9
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,366
how long of a runway does it need?

10
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,037
Which is a very important question

11
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:41,800
if you want to build a runway that can at least allow Airbus A380 to take off

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,467
you probably want it to be a little longer than that

13
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:46,133
just in case it takes a little bit longer than expected to take off

14
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:51,618
But what is the minimum length of the runway, given these numbers

15
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,200
so we want to figure out the displacement

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,200
or how far does this plane travel, as it's accelerating at 1 m/s^2

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:11,800
to 280 km/h...or to 78 m/s...I converted it right over here

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,600
as it accelerates to 78 m/s

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,318
how much land does this thing cover?

20
00:01:20,318 --> 00:01:23,569
So we can say, so let's call this the displacement

21
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:26,216
is going to be equal to...

22
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:31,800
So displacement is equal to...you can view it as Velocity times Time

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,779
but the velocity here is changing

24
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:37,292
if we just had a constant velocity for this entire time

25
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:40,333
we could just multiply that times however long it's traveling

26
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,067
and it would give us the displacement

27
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,200
But here our velocity is changing

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,400
but lucky for us, we learned...

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:54,600
(I would encourage you to watch the video on average velocity for constant acceleration)

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,000
but if you have constant acceleration

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,600
and that is what we are assuming in this example

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,933
If you assume that your acceleration is constant

33
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:10,400
then you could come up with something called an *average velocity*

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,508
And the average velocity...if your acceleration is constant...

35
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,467
if and only if your acceleration is constant

36
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:23,733
then your average velocity will be the average of your final velocity and your initial velocity

37
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:27,590
and so in this situation, what is our average velocity?

38
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,908
well our average velocity, let's do it in m/s

39
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:32,067
is going to be our final velocity, which is

40
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,200
(let me calculate it down here)

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,667
so our average velocity in this example

42
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:39,242
Velocity_average in this example...

43
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:43,200
is going to be our final example...78 m/s

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,067
plus our initial velocity,. But what's our initial velocity?

45
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,000
We're assuming we're starting at a standstill

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,829
...plus 0...

47
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,533
all of that over 2

48
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:55,000
So our average velocity in this situation

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,200
78 divided by 2 is 39 m/s

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,600
and the value of an average velocity

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,975
in this situation, in any situation

52
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,614
the value of an average velocity

53
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:12,467
is that we could figure out our displacement

54
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:22,014
by multiplying our *average velocity* times the <i>time</i> that goes by

55
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:24,846
times the change in time

56
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:28,200
So we know the change in time is 78 seconds...

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,990
we know our average velocity here is 39 m/s...

58
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,733
(just the average of 0 and 78..39 m/s)

59
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,800
Another way to think about it

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,333
if you want to think about the distance traveled

61
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,955
this plane is constantly accelerating

62
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:46,952
so let me draw a little graph here

63
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:52,455
this plane's velocity-time graph will look something like this

64
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:56,667
so this is time...and this is velocity right over here

65
00:03:56,667 --> 00:04:00,067
this plane has a constant acceleration starting with 0 velocity

66
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,813
it has a constant acceleration

67
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:04,267
this slope right here is its constant acceleration

68
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:07,455
it should actually be a slope of 1, given the numbers in this example

69
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,359
And the distance traveled

70
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,600
is the area under this curve, up to 78 seconds

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,372
because that's how long it takes for it to take off

72
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:19,867
so the distance traveled is this area right over here

73
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:21,467
(which we will cover in another video)

74
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,400
Or let me give you the intuition of why that works...

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,867
why distance is area under a velocity-time line

76
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:31,023
What an average velocity is, is some velocity

77
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:34,367
and in this case it's exactly right between our two...

78
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,573
our final and initial velocities

79
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:38,467
But if you take that average velocity

80
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,149
for the same amount of time

81
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:44,733
you would get the exact same area under the curve

82
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,200
or you would get the exact same distance

83
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
So our average velocity is 39 m/s times 78 seconds

84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,453
and let's just get our calculator out for this

85
00:04:55,453 --> 00:05:04,867
we have 39*78...gives us 3042

86
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:08,067
so this gives us 3042...

87
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:11,867
and then m/s times second just leaves us with meters

88
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:16,488
so you need a runway of over 3000 meters

89
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:18,555
for one of these suckers to take off

90
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:24,406
or over 3 kilometers, which is about 1.8 or 1.9 miles

91
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:26,240
just for this guy to take off

92
00:05:26,240 --> 99:59:59,999
which I think is pretty fascinating
