1
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:08,448
Architecture's language, and you know when you learn a new vocabulary word,

2
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:11,091
you start to notice it for the first time everywhere?

3
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:13,316
Well, the same thing happens with architecture.

4
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:17,465
When you learn a new architectural form, you start to see it everywhere.

5
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:23,786
And it's especially true of the classical orders, because these are, what are essentially the building blocks

6
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:27,967
of western architecture, and they've been used for 2500 years.

7
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:34,236
We're basically talking about styles of architecture that that the ancient Greeks have developed mostly for their temples.

8
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:37,172
And you're right, that we've continued to use.

9
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:40,377
And we've got several contemporary examples up along the top.

10
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:48,854
But what's important to remember is that it's just a fancy dressing, really, of a basic, ancient building system.

11
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:55,301
So we've brought in Stonehenge to illustrate that ancient building system called Post and Lintel architecture.

12
00:00:55,301 --> 00:01:00,299
This is the most fundamental, most basic, oldest kind of architectural system.

13
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:08,208
The posts are the vertical elements, and they support horizontal elements called a lintel.

14
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:13,177
And you know what? We still use this basic system when we nail two by fours [2x4s] together.

15
00:01:13,177 --> 00:01:17,518
And that's what the Greeks were doing, but they were doing it in a much more sophisticated way.

16
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:23,551
Right, they developed decorative systems, and that's what we're referring to when we use the term "Classical Orders".

17
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:28,392
There are three basic orders: the Doric, the Ionic, and the Corinthian.

18
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:32,049
There's a couple extra, but we're not going to go into those today, but we've listed them here for you,

19
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,769
just so you know what they are, at the Tuscan and the Composite.

20
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,640
So the Doric and Ionic and Corinthian are illustrated here in this diagram.

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,341
First the Doric, then the Ionic, and then the last two are Corinthian.

22
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,614
These are just slight variations of these three orders.

23
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:55,551
And the Doric is really the most simple, the Ionic a little bit more complicated, and then the Corinthian completely out of control.

24
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:58,085
So let's start with the oldest order, the Doric order.

25
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:04,626
Right, we think that this order began in the 7th century, on the mainland in Greece.

26
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:09,098
And we're looking at an actual Greek temple, that happens to be in Italy,

27
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:13,668
but nevertheless is just a great example of the Doric in the Classical Era.

28
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:15,879
Let's start at the top, with the pediment.

29
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:22,511
The pediment isn't officially part of the order, but since Greek temples had it in one end or the other,

30
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:28,987
a pediment, we just thought we would name that for you, and that's that triangular space at the very top of the temple

31
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:32,556
Right, these are gabled roofs. Sometimes they would be filled with sculpture.

32
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:38,050
The next area below the pediment is, actually, officially part of the order,

33
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,129
and that's called the entablature.

34
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,634
Okay, so that would be the area from about here to here.

35
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:47,468
And the top part of the entablature is called a frieze.

36
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:54,588
Okay, so only this part right here is known as the frieze, so this whole section.

37
00:02:54,588 --> 00:03:01,052
Right, and in the Doric order it is decorated in a very specific way, using triglyphs and metopes.

38
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:06,322
Now, actually, if you look at the word "Triglyph", you notice that the prefix is "tri",

39
00:03:06,322 --> 00:03:10,875
just like "tricycle", it means "three", and the suffix, "glyph", means mark,

40
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,543
so a "triglyph" literally means "three marks".

41
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:18,335
And you can see patterns of three marks moving all the way across the frieze.

42
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:23,442
And then in-between the triglyphs are spaces that are called metopes.

43
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:27,507
And in ancient Greek architecture these were often filled with sculpture.

44
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,349
Now, the triglyphs, we don't think they're just arbitrary.

45
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,648
We think that they probably came from a time when temples were built out of wood,

46
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:40,654
and these would have been the ends of planks, that would have functioned as beams in the temple.

47
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:44,228
And they would have, of course, been supported directly over the columns.

48
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:47,865
You'll notice that every other one, at least, is aligned directly over the columns.

49
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:53,667
So if we move down the temple, the next area we come to is the capital.

50
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,140
And this is a Doric capital. It's very simple.

51
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,139
It's got a flare, and the it's got a simple slab on top.

52
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,582
So the Doric is the oldest, most severe, and was associated,

53
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:11,757
according to the ancient Roman architectural historian, Vitruvius, with masculine form.

54
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:16,591
It is broad, it's not tall, and it feels heavy.

55
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:17,729
It does.

56
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:24,472
As we continue to move down, we come to the area that we commonly call the column, but art historians call the shaft.

57
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:30,509
And if you look closely, you can see that it's not entirely plain, there are actually vertical lines

58
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:34,224
that move across the entire surface, known as flutes.

59
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:38,581
Now in the Doric a flute is very shallow, and really, what it is is a kind of scallop

60
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:41,216
that's been carved out of the surface.

61
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:47,391
And what fluting does, is it creates a nice vertical decorative pattern along the shaft.

62
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:54,567
Now one of the other defining features of the Doric order is that at the bottom of the shaft there is no decorative foot.

63
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:59,571
The shaft of the column goes straight into the floor of the temple.

64
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:11,880
And you can see that really well in the detail on the lower right, where there's no molding there to make a transition.

65
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,813
So let's have a look at what these look like in person.

66
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,951
Capitals are up high, so we would never see a person next to them,

67
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:17,258
but I think it's easy to not realise just how big they are.

68
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:22,393
But I snapped this terrific picture of you at the British Museum next to a capital,

69
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:28,033
that actually comes from the most famous Doric temple, on the Acropolis of Athens.

70
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:29,199
Right, the Parthenon. And they really are massive.

71
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:38,732
And this photo is good also for seeing, in this case a reconstruction, but giving you a sense of the entablature,

72
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:41,778
with that frieze, with triglyphs and metopes.

73
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:49,151
And we've got an example, on the right, of a relief sculpture that was for one of the metopes of the Parthenon.

74
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:54,064
Right, so this metope here would have actually fit right in one of these squares.

75
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:59,503
Let's talk about one last element that we find in Doric architecture, and that's something called entasis.

76
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:05,275
Now, this is a little tricky, because I think most people assume that a column is straight up and down,

77
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:09,238
that is, the sides of a column are parallel with each other,

78
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:14,146
and the base of the column is just as wide as the area directly below the capital.

79
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:17,913
But in fact the ancient Greeks didn't build their temples that way.

80
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:22,907
No, it's fascinating to think about all the ways that the ancient are thinking

81
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:27,992
about how to make their buildings beautiful and speak of the realm of the gods.

82
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:36,598
And so when we look at an ancient Doric temple, we see that the shafts swell a little bit toward the centre.

83
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:41,005
So right about a third of the way down they would be at their widest,

84
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:49,019
and it would taper ever so slightly towards the bottom, and taper much more so as we move up to the top.

85
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:54,652
So that the narrowest point of the column shaft would be right at the top,

86
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:59,256
and the widest part would be about a third of the way from the base.

87
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:04,560
And so the building has a sense of liveliness, that I think it wouldn't have if the column was

88
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,808
exactly the same width at the top as at the bottom.

89
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:11,701
Architectural historians have debated why the Greeks bothered to do this,

90
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:17,337
because this was expensive, this was difficult, it meant that every drum that makes up this column,

91
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:21,278
had to be an individual, unique piece.

92
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:24,646
These could not be mass measured and mass produced.

93
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:26,753
Right, so you just used a drum.

94
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:29,820
So the columns are not actually carved from one piece of stone.

95
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,255
And if you look very carefully at this photograph, you can just make out the scenes between those drums.

96
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:41,733
There would also have generally been a hole that would have gone through the centre of each of these pieces,

97
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:47,267
so that a piece of wood sometimes would actually string them together almost like beads on a necklace.

98
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:53,556
One of the other things that entasis does is to emphasise the verticality of the temple,

99
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,582
because they get narrower as they go further up.

100
00:07:57,582 --> 00:08:01,753
It seems as if the shaft of the column might actually be taller than it really is,

101
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:05,757
because, of course, as things move away from us they get smaller in scale.

102
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:08,625
So the Greeks are thinking about human perception.

103
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:15,762
They're thinking about how we see, not just an abstract idea of math and geometry, but actually human experience,

104
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,030
which says something about ancient Greek culture.

105
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:24,559
One last detail. The entasis gives the shaft of the column a sense of almost elasticity,

106
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:27,711
that it is burying the weight of the stone above it.

107
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:33,186
It's really fascinating to think about all of these decisions that the Greeks are making as they build.

108
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:38,150
So let's look at the Ionic order, which emerges shortly after the Doric order.

109
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,791
Here's another building on the Acropolis. This is the Erechtheion.

110
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,929
This is such a different aesthetic. There's such a sense of delicacy here.

111
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:52,152
There is not that sense of mass, that sense of the muscularity of the buildings that we associate with the Doric.

112
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:58,107
And in fact Vitruvius, the ancient Roman architectural historian, saw this as a more feminine order.

113
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:00,441
It's taller, it's thinner...

114
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:07,250
Now one of the columns from this building in Greece is in the Museum in Lonodon. We have some good photographs of it

115
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,789
And you can see the distinguishing really is at the top, at the capital,

116
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:16,658
where we see these scroll-like shapes, also known as volutes.

117
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:20,530
We also see a slightly different type of fluting,

118
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,397
and we also, importantly, see a base.

119
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,901
Let's move to the Corinthian order.

120
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:28,875
This looks really different, and is the most decorative,

121
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:34,443
and the distinguishing feature here is, again, the capital, where we see leaf-like shapes.

122
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:41,986
They also have bases, they tent to be taller than the Doric, just like the Ionic, but they are highly decorative.

123
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:45,900
There's a great myth about the origin of the Corinthian capital.

124
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,730
It's a kind of fun story, of course we have no idea whether this is true,

125
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,330
but the story is that there was a young girl who died, and her possessions were placed in a basket

126
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,333
and put on top of her grave.

127
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:01,979
Underneath that basket was an acanthus plant that began to grow,

128
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:08,515
and because the heavy basket with the tile on top was on top, the acanthus leaves grew out to the side.

129
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:12,018
Well, if we look at the Corinthian column, it really does look like that.

130
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:13,485
It looks exactly like that.

131
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:16,182
And so it's a great myth, whether or not it's true.

132
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,492
So the Corinthian order is the most complex.

133
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:22,358
It includes both the scroll, that we would expect to see in the Ionic...

134
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:23,466
The volutes.

135
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:28,730
Right. But also these very complex leaf-like forms, which you can just make out here,

136
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,538
which is actually from the acanthus leaf.

137
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:33,737
And we have a photograph of an acanthus leaf right down here.

138
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:35,771
And these grow wild, so it makes sense.

139
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:43,217
What's important to remember, is that the ancient Greeks, although they developed these three classical orders,

140
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:47,817
were just the genesis, the Romans took these ideas over, and then subsequently,

141
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:52,961
people who've looked back to the classical tradition have borrowed from them yet again.

142
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:56,157
And we still do this today. 
And there you have it, the Greek orders.
