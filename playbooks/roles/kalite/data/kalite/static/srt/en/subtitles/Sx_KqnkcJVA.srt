1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,680
We're on problem 47 on page 281.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,830
If the two floors in a certain building are 9 feet apart,

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,120
how many steps are there in a set of stairs that extends

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,570
from the first floor to the second floor of the building?

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,040
So I think I can draw that.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,630
So this is the second floor, this is the first floor.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,410
They want to know how many there's--

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,300
they're 9 feet apart, that's what they tell us already--

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,850
9 feet we need to figure out how many steps there are

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,030
to go from the first to the second floor.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,000
So piece of information one, they give us,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,160
each step is 3/4 foot high.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,010
Well, this by itself should give us enough information,right?

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,550
Because each of these distances-- I'll do it in green--

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,000
each of these are 3/4 foot high.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,900
So to figure out how many total steps to get to the top

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,060
you just say 3/4 times the number of steps

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,830
is going to be equal to 9.

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,760
And then you could just solve this by multiplying

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,330
both sides by 4/3.

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,300
But we don't have to solve it.

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,030
We just have to know that we can solve for it.

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,700
So one, alone, is enough, right?

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,580
And you could, what?

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,200
If you multiply both sides of this you get 12 steps.

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,640
But anyway, we want to avoid having to actually do math.

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,840
We just want to figure out whether we can do the math.

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,820
Piece of information two, each step is 1 foot wide.

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,300
Well, that's clearly useless because it doesn't tell us

30
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,590
how much altitude we're making on each step

31
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,460
and that's what you have to figure out to say

32
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,070
how many steps you need to go up 9 feet in the air.

33
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,340
So this is useless.

34
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,050
So the answer is A: statement one alone is sufficient.

35
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,900
Next problem.

36
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,100
48.

37
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,650
If xy is equal to 0, oh, does not equal 0.

38
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,840
So that tells us that neither x nor y is 0, right?

39
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,060
Is x divided by y going to be less than 0?

40
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,560
In order for this to be true one of these numbers--

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,520
so I mean if x divided by y is negative, that means that

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,010
either x or y, but not both of them, are negative, right?

43
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,780
That's the only way you can get a negative number

44
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,480
when you're dividing.

45
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,020
If both of them are negative this would be a positive number.

46
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,020
So let's see what we can do with their information.

47
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,180
Number one.

48
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,340
x is equal to, and this is the question, is x/y less than 0?

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,750
And one says x is equal to minus y.

50
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,840
Well, immediately let's just substitute that back in.

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,000
If x is equal to minus y then what's x/y?

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,250
x is equal to minus y,

53
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,370
so you have minus y/y and that will equal--

54
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,010
and we know y doesn't equal 0.

55
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,690
So for any other value other than 0--

56
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,370
if this was 0 this would be undefined--

57
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,000
but then this is equal to negative 1.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,980
So in this case x divided by y is equal to negative 1,

59
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,760
which is definitely less than 0.

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,380
So that proves our statement.

61
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,020
So statement one alone is all we need.

62
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,840
Now let's see what statement two gives us.

63
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
I'll do it here.

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,020
Statement two.

65
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:46,050
Minus x is equal to minus minus y.

66
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,290
So that tells us that minus x is equal to y

67
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,040
and then we can just substitute the same thing in again.

68
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,130
Well, now we could substitute for x,

69
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,170
or we could just multiply both sides by negative,

70
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,840
you get x is equal to minus y,

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,720
which is the same thing as this here.

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,090
So statement two, alone,

73
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,060
is also sufficient to solve this problem.

74
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,000
And so the answer is D: each statement, alone, is sufficient.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,660
Switch colors, problem 49.

76
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:27,010
How many people are directors of both company k and company r?

77
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:35,030
OK. Directors of k and r.

78
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,090
Statement number one.

79
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,860
There were 17 directors present at a joint meeting of

80
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,890
the directors of companies k and r

81
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,030
and no directors were absent.

82
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,250
At a joint meeting of the directors,

83
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,030
so that's all the directors of k and r.

84
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,340
So let me draw some Venn Diagrams.

85
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:06,050
So if that is k and then that is r.

86
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,060
So they're saying that when you add both of these together,

87
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,180
because this is a joint meeting of all the directors of both,

88
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,130
we got 17.

89
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,260
So there's 17 in this entire universe of directors.

90
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,980
That's what statement one tells us.

91
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,760
If you take this whole circle and then you add up the extra--

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,840
don't double count the intersection--

93
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,000
you add up the extra, you get 17.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,380
But that alone doesn't tell us

95
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,490
how many joint directors there are.

96
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,650
Joint directors are these people.

97
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,890
People who are on the board of both k and r.

98
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,040
So this is k and this is r.

99
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,000
So statement one alone doesn't help us.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,010
Although, I'm suspecting,

101
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,090
maybe in conjunction with something else, it could.

102
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,590
Statement number two is company k has 12 directors

103
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,220
and company r has 8 directors.

104
00:05:52,220 --> 00:06:06,580
OK. k is equal to 12 directors and r is equal to 8 directors.

105
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:17,760
OK, so everything in the k circle combined is 8, right?

106
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,420
Sorry, everything in the k circle is 12, right?

107
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,340
k directors.

108
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,010
Everything in the r circle is 8.

109
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,140
Now, if we wanted to get the total of the k and the r--

110
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,200
so by itself that doesn't tell me how many overlap.

111
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,200
So when you take statement one or statement two independently

112
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,350
that doesn't help us.

113
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,490
But what if we were to figure out

114
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,410
if we would use them together?

115
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,780
So how many total directors are there going to be?

116
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,580
There's going to be the total directors in k--

117
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:57,000
so k's directors-- plus the director's in r.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,330
But if you were to just add those two up,

119
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,570
you would double count the people who are in both k and r,

120
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:03,960
right?

121
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,010
You would count them twice.

122
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,620
You would count them when they're in k

123
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,490
and you would count them when they're in r.

124
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,690
So if you wanted to figure out

125
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,950
how many total directors there are

126
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,960
you would then subtract out the people who are in k and r,

127
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,870
right?

128
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,160
You don't want to subtract them twice,

129
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,780
you just don't want to double count them, right?

130
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,430
Because when you we do k plus r you're counting them for k

131
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,670
and then you're counting them for r.

132
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,780
So let's subtract them out once so that

133
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,600
you only count them for k or that you only count them for r.

134
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,580
You only count them once.

135
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,660
So minus kr--

136
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,010
so this notation that's people who are in k and r.

137
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,210
And what does that equal?

138
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,270
Well, statement one told us that.

139
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,010
It told us that they're total of 17 directors.

140
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,010
And so statement two told us there are 12 directors in k

141
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:53,680
plus 8 directors in r minus the joint directors is equal to 17

142
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,800
And, by the way, we don't even have to do this.

143
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,990
We could've just recognized that

144
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,410
if we know the total number of directors

145
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,010
and we know how many are in each of the groups

146
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,240
that we can figure it out.

147
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,590
And we would just answer the question

148
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,740
that both statements together are sufficient.

149
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,680
But I'll just show you that

150
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,690
we can figure it out just so that you're happy with it.

151
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,030
Let's see, we get 20 minus kr is equal to 17.

152
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,090
And so you get kr is equal to 3.

153
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,100
So there are 3 directors that overlap with both

154
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,560
and we were only able to answer that question

155
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,060
by using statement one and statement two.

156
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,600
Next problem, 50.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,780
If x and y are positive is xy greater than 1?

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,420
Statement number one tells us xy is greater than 1.

159
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,000
So let's see, does that help us at all?

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And that's not obvious.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,580
That just tells us that

162
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,330
x is greater than 1/y or y is greater than 1/x.

163
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,850
So let's just think about it, this statement is equivalent,

164
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,990
if we multiply both sides by y.

165
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,120
And we can do that without changing the inequality

166
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,000
because we know y is greater than 0.

167
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,080
So if we do that, we get x is greater than y.

168
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,810
If we can show this, we can show that.

169
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,360
And remember,

170
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,480
the only reason why I didn't have to change the inequality

171
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,670
is because I knew that when I'm multiplying both sides by y,

172
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,020
that y is greater than 0.

173
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,620
If y was less than 0 I'd have to switch the sign right here

174
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,010
when I multiply both sides by it.

175
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,420
But anyway, if I can prove x is greater than y, we're all set

176
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,070
This doesn't help me.

177
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,440
Let's see,

178
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,010
statement number two is x minus y is greater than 0.

179
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,170
Well,if I add y to both sides of this equation what do I get?

180
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,480
I get x is greater than y.

181
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,450
So this proves exactly what I need to prove,

182
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,350
and if you want to go all the way to what originally they asked,

183
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,770
divide both sides by y--

184
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,710
and we don't have to change the sign because y is positive--

185
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,870
you get x divided by y is greater than 1.

186
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,620
Which is exactly what we needed to prove.

187
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,050
So statement two, alone, is sufficient.

188
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,060
