00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:14,318
Greetings, fellow thinkers.

2
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:16,135
I am Alessandro Volta,

3
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:19,188
and today I invite you to join me on a journey of discovery.

4
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:22,118
Together, we will relive my greatest triumph:

5
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:24,957
the invention of the battery.

6
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:28,790
But you say: "This doesn't look much like a battery!"

7
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:30,760
Perhaps you were expecting:

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,132
One of these.

9
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:33,427
Or even:

10
00:00:33,427 --> 00:00:35,553
One of these.

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,864
But my reply is this:

12
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:39,949
All these batteries are the same

13
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:42,539
and they only require one thing to make them work:

14
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,663
A flow of electrons from high concentration to low concentration

15
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:50,196
This simple idea powers flashlights, computers,

16
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:53,362
and even tiny little helicopters!

17
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,721
Come, meet my colleague Luigi Galvani.

18
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:03,872
It is upon his research that I based my most important discovery.

19
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:10,392
[singing] Frogs frogs frogs, you gotta cut them up to see how they work.

20
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:15,599
[singing] Frogs frogs frogs, you gotta cut them up to see how they work.

21
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,275
[off-screen] Galvani, how are you?

22
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:19,076
Ah, Volta!

23
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:21,025
Perfecto timing for a lab visit.

24
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:25,524
I've just received an amazing new piece of equipment:

25
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:28,803
A set of pinchers, where one part is made of copper

26
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:31,032
and the other part is made of zinc

27
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:32,725
and using these pinchers,

28
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,707
I'm going to dissect the frog.

29
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:38,532
Would you be so kind as to demonstrate for me?

30
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:40,198
Gladly.

31
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:51,276
Whoa, behold: electricity!

32
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:56,331
From the tissues of this humble beast I've evoked electrical fire.

33
00:01:56,331 --> 00:02:02,265
Amazing. With this power,

34
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:05,802
we could drive electric carriages and electric boats

35
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:10,118
and if electricity resides in a single frog,

36
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:12,195
we could feed one frog to another -

37
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:15,176
and the second to a third and the third to a fourth -

38
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:20,111
and make a gigantic frog full of fiery electric potential.

39
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:22,254
Ah, but you're wrong my dear friend.

40
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:24,443
You've made a magnificent discovery,

41
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:27,044
but you misunderstand the cause.

42
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,899
Well, where does the electricity come from?

43
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:33,655
You're using tools that are made out of two different metals:

44
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:35,892
Zinc and Copper

45
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:37,894
This is the source of the current.

46
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:42,384
If you were to use tools that were made of the same metal,

47
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:44,572
nothing happens - see?

48
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,313
But with my pinchers of zinc and copper,

49
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:53,509
- Amazing, amazing!

50
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:55,699
This is truly a wonderful discovery.

51
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,337
Thank you, Volta. But now you've got me thinking:

52
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:02,458
Why does electricity flow from one metal to another?

53
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,733
What makes copper and zinc different?

54
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,212
I'm so glad you asked.

55
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:11,028
Let me tell you a tale: a tale of two metals,

56
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:12,731
a tale about swimming,

57
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:15,113
and a tale about cats and dogs.

58
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:22,409
Here we have zinc, a metal that is made of dog-atoms.

59
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,511
All of his dog-atoms love the ocean.

60
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:28,791
They'd do practically anything to go for a swim in the salty water.

61
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:33,660
And here we have his friend copper, who is covered in cats.

62
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,144
All of his atoms are cats.

63
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:41,418
They hate the ocean and want to get out of the water as soon as possible.

64
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,246
Whenever a dog hops into the water,

65
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:47,771
it has to leave two of its electrons behind.

66
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:56,201
What am I going to do with all these extra electrons?

67
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:59,227
And in order for a cat-ion to get out of the water,

68
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:02,281
it's got to find two electrons.

69
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:05,761
Cat-ions: Hey! Get us out of the water! We hate swimming!

70
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:08,411
I want to help you, but I have no electrons.

71
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:11,649
Cat-ions: But it's cold in here! Can't you get us dry without electrons?

72
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:14,604
Nope. It takes two electrons to get you out of the water.

73
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,839
But, let me call my friend Zinc.

74
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,985
He may have extra electrons.

75
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,029
[phone ringing]

76
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:25,352
Hello? Zinc speaking.

77
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:26,939
Zinc, it's Copper.

78
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:30,086
Oh man, did you know I was just about to call you?

79
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,582
Really? Hey, listen, can you do me a favor:

80
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:36,214
do you and your dog-ions have any extra electrons around?

81
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:40,462
That is so crazy! I was about to call you because I have all these dog-atoms,

82
00:04:40,462 --> 00:04:43,333
and every time they go swimming, they leave behind two electrons.

83
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,943
Now I've got tons of electrons and I don't know what to do.

84
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:50,929
Honestly, I'm feeling pretty negative about the whole situation.

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,735
Well, I'm positive we can find a solution.

86
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,301
Why don't you send a couple of electrons through the wire?

87
00:04:57,301 --> 00:05:01,603
That way I can pull some of my cat-ions out of the water.

88
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:03,057
Right on, man.

89
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:05,654
I'll send them through two at a time.

90
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:12,989
[sound of electricity running through the wire]

91
00:05:18,743 --> 00:05:20,797
[purring]

92
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,778
Oh, my cat's purring! It loves being out of the water.

93
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,054
Hey, Zinc, have any more electrons?

94
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,893
Totally!

95
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:51,729
In this way, the two friends are able to share electrons through the wire,

96
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,887
creating an electric current.

97
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,641
The zinc dogs want to swim,

98
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,585
the copper cats want to get dry,

99
00:05:57,585 --> 00:06:00,816
and that's what makes electricity flow through a battery.

100
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:04,389
Here's the zinc, whose atoms are like dogs and want to swim.

101
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:09,262
Here's the copper, whose atoms are like cats.

102
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:13,687
Here's the wire through which Zinc sends its extra electrons to Copper.

103
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:17,927
This flow of electrons is called an electric current.

104
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,465
You can use that current to power a lightbulb,

105
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:21,686
or a speaker.

106
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:23,761
Or a frog's leg!

107
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:31,770
Electrons flow from the zinc through the frog's leg and into the copper.

108
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:35,118
The nerve in the frog's muscle is sensitive to electricity,

109
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,316
and it flexes from the current.

110
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:41,858
Now I understand! The electricity isn't generated in the frog's leg.

111
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:46,706
Rather, electrons leaving zinc and traveling into the copper create the current.

112
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:50,623
Yes! And if you want to make your own battery,

113
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,472
all you need are: two kinds of metals,

114
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:53,671
a wire,

115
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:55,584
and something salty or sour.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,267
Here's one that I made.

117
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:03,748
We have a zinc nail, a nice bit of copper, and this beautiful winter gourd.

118
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:06,961
I am using it to power the tiny speaker here.

119
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,939
[music]

120
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:10,973
Oh, that's good.

121
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,155
I made my famous batteries with zinc and copper,

122
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:17,879
but other metals would work as well.

123
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,951
Lithium batteries are in cellphones, and lead battereis are in cars.

124
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:25,367
And instead of a gourd, you could try using really salty water

125
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,532
or potatoes, or vinegar, or even ammonia.

126
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,812
In every case, there's two metals:

127
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:34,759
one that likes to go swimming, and one that likes to stay dry.

128
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,189
And the difference between the two of them allows the electrons to flow.

129
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:39,708
[sighing]

130
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:41,911
Hey buddy, what's wrong?

131
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,876
You made a wonderful discovery today!

132
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,578
Yeah, I know.

133
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:50,246
But I got totally wrapped up in the idea that we could use frogs

134
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,485
fed to other frogs

135
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:52,900
to power the world.

136
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,245
And now I realize that the data say otherwise.

137
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,022
And so, I guess I have no more need for these guys.

138
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:02,852
Godspeed, Frogs.

139
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:06,122
Adieu.
