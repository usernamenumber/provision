1
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:08,160
Okay, Monica and Brian in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,724
Upstairs, in the Ancient Near Eastern section.

3
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:14,362
Right, we're here looking at some Assyrian art.

4
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:20,860
And you can't help, but be intimidated when you walk into this gallery with the presence of power.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,769
You've got these huge sculptures planking these entrances, fantastic creatures.

6
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:31,854
Even in the 21st century in the safety of the museum, I feel a little intimidated.

7
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:33,673
They tower above you.

8
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:37,015
And these would be a gateway to the palace, is that right?

9
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:38,685
Right to the throne room of the king.

10
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:42,411
So the actual throne room is not outside the gate, but actually within the vault.

11
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:43,077
Correct.

12
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:49,252
Now I would think, someone walking into the palace-someone walking into the throne room would be an invited guest.

13
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:51,145
This is still to have them intimidated walking in?

14
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:54,445
Sure, even invited guests need to be reminded of the power of the King.

15
00:00:54,445 --> 00:01:00,327
So, in addition to the scale here, where else would we get a clear indication of power?

16
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:07,711
The creatures themselves are very intimidating. They got the heads of men and the body of very powerful beasts.

17
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:12,461
Feline body on the one side and this bull's body on the other side.

18
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:13,973
That's interesting, you said creature.

19
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:18,566
So we walk up and you see the face of the King staring right out at you and there's one on either side.

20
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,854
So they're symmetrical.

21
00:01:19,854 --> 00:01:23,831
You see the face of the King and it takes you a minute to notice that he is a creature, he is not the king.

22
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:24,844
That's right.

23
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:29,072
So the body is described as what? We've got a two different legs in the front.

24
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:31,281
So there are hoofs on the one on the right.

25
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:35,682
Right, some Bovine creature, and a feline creature with these claws paws on the left.

26
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:41,500
So from the front we're stopped by the king on this massive kind of beast looking figure.

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,281
Right.

28
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:46,865
Then as we walk into the space in between them, we notice they have wings.

29
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:50,782
That's right. So real composite fantastic creature.

30
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:58,265
So this was as you were saying, a symbol of power, in a sense of fantasy of the creature that would kind of puzzle people looking at them?

31
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,264
Sure.

32
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:04,282
So an intimidating factor of beguiling people with these images.

33
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:04,982
Right.

34
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:10,132
So as we walk pass them, we notice something quirky about the naturalism of the figures.

35
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:15,565
That's right. We look at them from the front. We see the two legs on either side.

36
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:19,167
And then when we move to the side, we see the all four legs.

37
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,833
So how many legs does that give us?

38
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:21,877
Wow, so that's five legs.

39
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:22,613
That's right.

40
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:24,082
So two distinctive views.

41
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:26,847
That's right. It's not meant to be seen obliquely.

42
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:30,682
You see it from the front, or you see it from the side. And it makes sense either way.

43
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:35,064
so from the front, you can imagine someone coming to the throne room and their progresses are rested

44
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:41,932
and they say, "Hey, stop." And as they walk through, the beasts kind of walks with them?

45
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:46,715
The beasts on either side makes visual sense when you're between them.

46
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:48,699
Because you can see all four legs as it should have.

47
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:55,557
If the legs were side by side as you see it from the front, the side view would only have three, and that wouldn't be satisfactory.

48
00:02:55,557 --> 00:03:01,374
Ah, okay. So the figure is shown as if kind of in motion in order to show us the proper parts of the body.

49
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:06,531
So there's a lot of carving, a lot of detail in the wings and in the beard.

50
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:14,232
Right, and in the typical Mesopotamian fashion, we get this combination of naturalism and stylization.

51
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:17,432
So there's certain parts of the body that looks very naturalistic.

52
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:21,732
Those claws look like feline claws, we can even see some muscles.

53
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:27,314
But a lot of the details have been stylized, have been reduced to these repeated geometrical forms.

54
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:30,964
Like the hair and the beard, like the wings themselves.

55
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:35,348
So natural and supernatural, but also we get it in terms of the design.

56
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,973
So design elements that are looking maybe at nature,

57
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:43,365
but then the beard with all those little repeated lozenges and spirals; very decorative.

58
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:44,166
It is.

59
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,382
So would you consider this a typical guardian figure from the acient world?

60
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:55,287
Yes, and it conforms to a Mesopotamian convention of those stylized elements in the hair and the wings and so on

61
00:03:55,287 --> 00:04:01,723
So if I'm remembering correctly, this is Assyrian art, and early Mesopotamian art wouldn't be quite so focused on the king, correct?

62
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:08,130
That's right. Earlier Mesopotamian art, such as Sumerian art, was much more focused on the Gods.

63
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,364
Oh, and the king as the servant to the Gods.

64
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:15,365
King as a representative of the Gods or the servant to Gods, not as God-like himself.

65
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:18,558
And here, interestingly, we have the head of the king,

66
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:23,915
and yet, what he's wearing on his head is that triple horned crown that is associated with the Gods.

67
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:27,416
Ah-ha. So pretty clear here, who we're supposed to bow down and worship.

68
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,048
The king himself.
