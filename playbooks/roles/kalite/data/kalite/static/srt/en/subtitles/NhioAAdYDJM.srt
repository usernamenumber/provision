1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:06,748
What I want to do in this video is take a little bit about Seismic Waves

2
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:09,800
One because they are interesting by themeselves

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,200
But they are also really useful for figuring out what the actual composition of the earth is.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,400
You've seen my video on the actual layers of the earth

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,733
and seismic waves are crucial to actually realizing how people figured out what the different layers of the earth are

6
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:28,779
And just to be clear seismic waves, they are normal associated with earth quakes

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:33,205
but they are any waves that travel through the earth

8
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:41,729
That could be due to an earthquake or really just any kind of large explosion

9
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:46,444
Or anything that really in a sense starts sending energy through the rock on earth

10
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:49,282
Or really through earth itself

11
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:54,662
Now there are two fundamentally different types of seismic waves

12
00:00:54,662 --> 00:00:56,929
And we are going to focus on one more than the other

13
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:03,825
One is surface waves and the other is body waves

14
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:07,456
Now surface waves are one that literally travel across the surface of something

15
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:10,015
In this case we are talking about the surface of the ground

16
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:12,533
And this right here is a depiction of surface waves

17
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:19,157
And these really are more analogous to the type of waves we normally associate with the suface of water

18
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:22,083
And there are two types of surface waves: Rally waves then love waves

19
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,333
We won't go into a lot of detail but you can see that

20
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,356
Rally waves are kind of the ground moving up and down.

21
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:31,600
Right here the ground is moving up, here i'ts moving down, here it's moving up, here it's moving down'

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,733
So you can kind of view it as kind of a ground roll

23
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:39,262
The love waves are essentially the ground shifting left and right.

24
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:45,133
So here it's not moving up and down but if you are facing the direction of the wave movement

25
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:50,667
Its moving to the left here, here its moving to the right, here its moving to the left, here its moving to the right

26
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:56,513
In both cases, the movement of the surface wave is perpendicular to the direction of motion

27
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:59,200
So, we sometimes call these transverse waves

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,300
And these are essentially analogous to, as I said, kind of, what we see in water waves

29
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,067
Now the more interesting thing are the body waves, because the body waves...

30
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:09,733
First of all they are the fastest moving waves

31
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:14,400
and these are also the waves that are used to figure out the structure of the earth

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,856
So the body waves come in two varieties

33
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:22,652
You have your P-waves or Primary Waves

34
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:27,609
And you have your S-waves, or secondary waves

35
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:29,569
And they are depicted right over here

36
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:34,733
And these are actually energy that is being transfered through a body,

37
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:37,400
So it's not just moving along the surface of one

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,467
And so, here in this diagram that I got from Wikipedia,

39
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:44,333
Which I think Wikipedia got from the US Geological Survey

40
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,185
We have a hammer being hit on some rock or whatever

41
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:50,975
And what you see is right when the hammer gets hit at this end of the rock,

42
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:53,133
And I can zoom in a little bit

43
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:59,729
So lets say that I have this rock over here and I hit it right over here with a hammer

44
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:03,600
What that's immediately going to do, it is going to compress the rock

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,733
That the hammer comes in touch with

46
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,667
Its going to compress that rock

47
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:13,600
But then that energy is essentially the molecules are going to bump into the adjacent molecules

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,067
And then those adjacent molecules are going to bump into the molecules right next to it

49
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,067
And then they are going to bump into the molecules right next to it

50
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:24,667
So you are going to have this kind of compressed part of rock moving through the waves

51
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:29,133
So these are compressed and those molecules are going to bump into the adjacent molecules

52
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:34,933
So kind of immediately after that the rock will be denser right over here

53
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:38,800
The first thing that were bumped those will essentially bump into the ones right above them

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,133
And then they will kind of move back to where they were

55
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:45,000
And now the compression will have moved and if you fast-forward it will have moved a little forward

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,862
So, you essentially have this compression wave

57
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:50,333
You hit the hammer here and you essentially have a changing density

58
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,267
That is moving in the same direction of the wave

59
00:03:54,267 --> 00:04:00,446
In this situation, that is the direction of the wave

60
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:05,164
And you see the molecules are kind of going back and forth along that same axis

61
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:08,200
They are going along the same direction as the wave

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,333
So those are P-waves

63
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:17,933
And p-waves can travel through air, thats essentially what sound waves are, compression waves.

64
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:21,666
They can travel through liquid

65
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,267
And they can obviously travel through solids

66
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:28,000
And depending, in air they'll travel the slowest

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,333
They'll essentially move at the speed of sound, 330 meters per second which isn't really slow by everyday human standards

68
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,533
In liquid they'll move about 1500 meters per second

69
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:42,533
And then in granite, which is most of the crustal material of the earth

70
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:49,200
They'll move at 5000 meters per second, let me right that down

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,667
or actually 5 kilometers per second if they are moving through granite

72
00:04:53,667 --> 00:05:00,000
Now S-waves are essentially, if you were to hit a hammer on the side of this rock

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,133
So, let me draw another diagram since this is pretty small

74
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:09,467
If you were to hit a hammer right over here what it would do is it would

75
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:13,144
Temporarily kind of push all the rock kind over here it would deform it a little bit

76
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:16,182
and that would pull a little bit of the rock back with it and then this rock thats right above it

77
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:20,867
would slowly be pulled down while this rock that initially hit

78
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,667
will be moved back up

79
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:27,800
So, you fast forward maybe a mili-second and now the next layer of rock right above that

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,133
Maybe I should actually draw it like this

81
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:36,133
the next layer of rock right above that will be kind of deformed to the right

82
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:39,867
and if you keep fast forwarding it the deformation will move upwards

83
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:47,133
And notice, over here, once again, the movement of the wave is upwards

84
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:50,933
But, now the movement of the material is not going along the same axis

85
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,133
that we saw with the p-waves or compression waves

86
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,267
It is now moving perpendicular

87
00:05:55,267 --> 00:06:00,800
It is moving along a perpendicular axis or you could call this a transverse wave

88
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,200
The movement of the particles is now on a perpendicular axis to the actual movement of the waves

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
And so that is what an S-wave is

90
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,600
And they move a little bit slower than the p-waves

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,867
So if an earthquake were to happen you'd see the p-waves first

92
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:19,933
and then at about 60% of the speed of the p-waves you would see the s-wave

93
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,933
Now the most important thing to think about

94
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:25,800
especially from the point of view of figuring out the composition of the earth

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:34,554
is that the s-waves can only travel through solid

96
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:38,222
And you might say, "Wait! I've seen transvesre waves on water that look like this."

97
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:40,126
But, remember, that is a surface wave

98
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:41,937
We are talking about body waves

99
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:44,724
We're talking about things that are actually going through the body of water

100
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:46,535
And one way to think about this is...

101
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:50,204
If I had some water over here

102
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:51,876
So, let's say that this is a pool

103
00:06:51,876 --> 00:07:00,374
I'll draw a cross-section of water, I could have drawn it better than that

104
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:05,808
If I have a cross-section of water right over here

105
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,151
Lets think about it and hopefully it will make intuitive sense to you

106
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,148
If I were to compress some of the water

107
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:14,631
If I were to slam some part of the water here with like a big, i don't know,

108
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:17,882
If I were to just compress it really fast it would do...

109
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:23,130
The p-wave could transmit because those water molecules would bump into the water molecules next to it

110
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,219
which would bump into the water molecules next to that

111
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:30,333
So you would have a compression wave or a p-wave moving in the direction of my bump

112
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,200
So p-waves it makes sense, and the same thing is true of air, sound waves

113
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,533
And it makes sense that it could travel through a liquid

114
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:41,171
But let's say that you, and remember we're under the water, we're nothing thing about the surface

115
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:43,533
We're thinking about moving through the body of the water

116
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:53,410
Let's say that you were to kind of take that hammer and kind of slap the side of this volume of water here

117
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:59,200
Well, essentially all that would do, it would send a compression wave in that direction

118
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,467
It really wouldn't do anything it wouldn't allow a transverse wave to go that way

119
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:13,133
The water doesn't allow it to kind of, it doesn't have this elastic property

120
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:17,267
Where something bounces that way it is going to immediately bounce back that way

121
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:20,067
It is not being pulled back like a solid would

122
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:25,321
So, s-waves only travel through solids

123
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:28,867
So we are going to use, essentially our understanding of p-waves

124
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,800
Which travel through air, liquid, and solid

125
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,646
And our understanding of s-waves to essentially figure out what the composition of earth is
