1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:03,276
When economists refer to inflation today,

2
00:00:03,276 --> 00:00:08,930
they are referring to a general increase in the level of prices of goods and services.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,179
So they're really talking about price inflation.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,610
The reason why I stress that is because sometimes,

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,012
especially when the term "inflation" first came into usage,

6
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:28,582
it actually was referring to monetary inflation, or an increase in the money supply.

7
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,942
These two ideas are closely related.

8
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:34,475
But it's important to realize that people really are measuring inflation.

9
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:37,746
When they're talking about inflation today, they're talking about price inflation.

10
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:43,012
Because although these two things are related, they aren't always exactly the same thing.

11
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:51,610
It is generally true that if the money supply - and the money supply is more than just the amount of dollars that are printed.

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,275
It's affected by the amount of lending that's occurring,

13
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:57,510
it's affected by the number of transactions that are occurring in the economy.

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,843
And if that money supply that's affected by all of those things grows faster

15
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:09,209
than the total real productivity of the economy, then it will generally increase the level of prices.

16
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,543
But especially in the short-term, there could be other causes of price inflation.

17
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:15,779
You could have things like "supply shocks."

18
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:20,427
And a supply shock is the supply of something becomes scarce all of a sudden.

19
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:27,176
And the most typical example of a "supply shock" is the oil crisis in the 1970's.

20
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:31,011
If for whatever reason oil becomes scarce in a country like the United States,

21
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:37,988
then the price of oil and gas would go up. But then, these are inputs into a whole set of things.

22
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:43,761
Even that banana that you buy at the grocery store. If the price of oil or gas or both of them, frankly,

23
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:47,508
were to shoot up, even the price of your banana would shoot up.

24
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:51,875
Because to get that banana to your store, you need to use some gasoline.

25
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:56,925
In fact a significant fraction of that banana in that store would probably

26
00:01:56,925 --> 00:02:00,008
include the cost of the gasoline to operate that ship to take that banana

27
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:05,478
from wherever it was grown to your grocery store, and then on a railroad, and then on a truck or whatever.

28
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:10,008
So this would affect the general prices, not just the prices of oil or gas.

29
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,576
So these two things are related, but it is important to realize that people

30
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:17,149
are referring to price inflation.

31
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:21,568
And the general consensus is, a little bit of it is a good thing.

32
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,588
So, a little is good.

33
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:31,675
And I want to stress little is good. And we're talking 1, 2, maybe 3 per cent per year.

34
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:36,610
But anything larger than that gets a little scary because it can kind of snowball on itself.

35
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,010
But we'll talk about that in future videos when we talk about hyperinflation.

36
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,567
And economists are also afraid of inflation if it were to ever get negative.

37
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:46,067
That leads to "deflation" and we'll talk in future videos

38
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:51,409
why in many circles that is viewed as a scary thing.

39
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:59,341
Now, in the United States, the inflation is measured with the "consumer price index." CPI

40
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:04,675
You'll always hear this reported in the news especially if you watch some of the business programming.

41
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:08,132
And there are actually multiple consumer price indices.

42
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:10,410
And the one that people report whenever they say

43
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:18,539
the "CPI" went up 2%", they are actually referring to the CPI-U.

44
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:25,707
And the U here stands for urban consumers. And the reason why this is the headline CPI,

45
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:29,615
or the one that people actually report, is because most of the country

46
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:32,808
the United States, are urban consumers.

47
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:37,120
So this is the CPI that affects the largest number of peoples' pocketbooks.

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,617
And the way that it's calculated is, it's like the deflator, it's a price index,

49
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:45,787
and like the deflator it's measuring a general increase

50
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:48,142
or a general change in the level of prices.

51
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:50,786
But they actually are calculated in slightly different ways.

52
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:55,066
Although they should be close to each other

53
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:59,705
if they really are indices for measuring the general level of prices.

54
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:02,949
So the way that the CPI works is that they take a basket of goods

55
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:06,282
for this type of consumer in a base year.

56
00:04:06,282 --> 00:04:07,870
So they'll pick a base year.

57
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,704
And let's take a super simple example, a ridiculously simple example.

58
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:17,282
Let's say, in our little country, the urban consumer - so we'll focus on CPI-U -

59
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:19,536
only consumes two things.

60
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:23,203
In the next video we'll see that in reality we consume many more than two things

61
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:28,202
but two things, and they spend 60% of their money on apples

62
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:33,476
and they spend 40% of their money on bananas.

63
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:39,076
And in that base year we just set the base price of apples at a 100 and of bananas at a 100.

64
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:41,810
We're not saying that apples and bananas cost the same thing.

65
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,809
We're saying that we're spending 60% of our money on apples, 40% on bananas in that base year

66
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:51,475
and that this is just that base year level of prices.

67
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:53,202
What will matter is how much this grew,

68
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:58,573
what will this index change as we go to whatever year we want to calculate the inflation in,

69
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:00,216
relative to this base year.

70
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:06,151
So let's say in our current year, could be the very next year,

71
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:11,915
and we're going to assume the same ways, that we're spending 60% on apples and 40% on bananas,

72
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:19,349
in our current year, the apple index has grown 50% to 150,

73
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:22,475
so it is plus 50%,

74
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:25,434
and let's say that the banana index has grown to 180,

75
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,351
so bananas have gotten even more expensive.

76
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,266
Plus 80%.

77
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:34,876
So how would we measure, how much would we say the CPI-U has grown?

78
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,808
Well, we would take a weighted average of these indices,

79
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:39,866
or you could say a weighted average of the growth,

80
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:41,409
you could do it either way,

81
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,867
so let's do this either way to give you the same result.

82
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:50,659
So, in this year, our base index is 0.6 times a hundred,

83
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:54,946
plus 0.4 times a hundred,

84
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:59,749
and this will just come out to a hundred, this is 60 plus 40, this is equal to 100, as it should.

85
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:03,811
That is our base for our index.

86
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:08,066
Now over here, in our current year, so this is what we're transitioning to,

87
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,270
there's a couple of ways to do it,

88
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,730
you could say "Look, we're spending 60% on something that has gone up to 150 now".

89
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:26,205
So we'd say 0.6 times 150 and then we'd say plus 0.4 times 180,

90
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:29,566
and that gets us to, let me get my calculator out,

91
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:40,397
so that gets us 0.6 times 150 plus 0.4 times 180.

92
00:06:40,397 --> 00:06:45,087
So that gets us to 162.

93
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:47,270
So if we look at this basket,

94
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,479
and this is an overly simplified basket,

95
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:55,938
we have increased from 100 to 162.

96
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:58,561
Or you could say this is +62%.

97
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:01,732
And you would have gotten the same result if you took the weighted average of the percentages,

98
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:06,410
if you took 0.6 times 50% plus 0.4 times 80%,

99
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,739
we can do that in our head,

100
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:10,559
0.6 times 50% is going to be 30%

101
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:13,338
and then 0.4 times 80% is going to be 32%.

102
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:17,338
30 plus 32 gives us 62% growth.

103
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:21,391
If for this basket of goods, which we're assuming is I guess for this urban consumer,

104
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:23,642
from our base year to the current year.

105
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:27,335
In the next video we will look at what the basket of goods actually looks like

106
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:31,374
In the United States for an actual urban consumer.
