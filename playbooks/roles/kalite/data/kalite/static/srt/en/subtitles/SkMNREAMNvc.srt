1
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:07,667
Is ( -1, 7) is solution for the equations below.

2
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:11,267
The first equation is x + 2y =13, second equation

3
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:20,200
is 3x - y = -11, Inorder for -1,7 for solution for the system

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,333
it needs to satisfy both equations.

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:37,667
x = -1 and y = 7, need to satisfy both equations to

6
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:43,467
be a solution. Lets try with the first equation.

7
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:53,200
If x=-1 & y =7 we will test if it satisfies this equation.

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:04,600
So we have -1 + 2x7 = 13 ?I put a ? because we don't

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:12,200
know if it satisfies. -1 + 14 = 13

10
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:31,467
So 13 =13, so it satisfy the first equation.

11
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:35,800
Now lets us look at the second equation. We have

12
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:49,200
3 ( -1) - 7 = -11 ? Put ? as i don't know if it satisfies.

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:02:00,200
-3 - 7 = -11?

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,800
-3 -7 = -10. So we get

15
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:15,000
-10 = -11, no It is not true. So x = -1 & y=7

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,533
does not satisfy the second equation.

17
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:26,267
This over here is not a solution for the system.

18
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:29,467
The answer is No as it satisfies the first equation,

19
00:02:29,467 --> 99:59:59,999
but not the second.
