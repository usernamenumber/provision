1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,010
We're on problem 190.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,980
If the operation star with a circle around it

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,110
is defined for all a and b by the equation,

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,780
a star with a circle around it b

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,840
is equal to a squared times b over 3,

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,010
then what does 2 star with a circle around it

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,000
3 star with the circle around it minus 1 equal?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,360
So 3 star minus 1.

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,280
That's equal to--

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,530
let's see, I'll do this in magenta-- 3 star minus 1.

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,370
That's equal to 3 squared times minus 1

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,960
which is minus 3 squared, or minus 9. RightŁż

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,990
3 squared, 9. Times minus 1.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,870
That's minus 9 divided by 3 which is equal to minus 3.

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,800
So this reduces to 2 star minus 3

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,060
which is equal to 2 squared, which is 4, times minus 3.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,000
All of that over 3.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,660
Minus 3 divided by 3.

19
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,600
That's just minus 1.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,030
So you have minus 1 times 4 is equal to minus 4.

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,020
And that's choice E.

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,500
Problem 192.

23
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,500
No, 191!

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,260
Don't want to skip problems.

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,440
The inside dimensions of a rectangular wooden box

26
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,630
are 6 by 8 by 10.

27
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,890
A cylindrical canister is to be placed inside the box

28
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,730
so it stands upright

29
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,040
when the closed box rests on one of its 6 bases.

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,630
Of all such canisters that could be used,

31
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,570
what is the radius in inches of the one

32
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,670
that has maximum volume?

33
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,660
OK, so they're going to put one canister in this box.

34
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,020
And how do you maximize its volume?

35
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,070
So let's think about it this way.

36
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,640
Let's think about what a volume of a cylinder is.

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,490
If this is my cylinder,

38
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,840
its volume is the area of the side times the height. Right?

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,450
If the area of the side is equal to-- if this is the radius--

40
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,340
it would be pi r squared times the height.

41
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,090
Height times pi r squared.

42
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,020
Now what's r going to be equal to?

43
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,010
r has to go all the way around.

44
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,990
So, r is going to be equal to half--

45
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,310
well, it obviously equals half the diameter of this circle.

46
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,970
But if we look at the base that's 6 and 8,

47
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,250
if we use that as the base,

48
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,840
and the 10 comes out of the page,the radius can only be what?

49
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,240
The radius can only be 3

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,270
because the diameter of the circle can only be 6.

51
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,480
We don't get to use the 8.

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,310
So, this is the case if we use the 6 and the 8 side.

53
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,950
And so we'll kind of be-- I guess the best way

54
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,000
to think about it is we'll be wasting this base over here.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,220
The other possibility, if we had the 8 and the 10 side,

56
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,720
if this was our base then we could have a radius of 4.

57
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,030
Let me think about it.

58
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, radius would be a 4.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,080
Because we would have the height 8, we'd have a radius of 4.

60
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,470
Now when we look at this equation,

61
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,200
if we had to maximize either the--

62
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,110
this is going to be the volume of the cylinder--

63
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,850
if we had to maximize either the height or the radius,

64
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,120
because those are the two things that we can deal with,

65
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,380
which one, at least to you, seems more important?

66
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,510
Well, to me,

67
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,070
the radius seems more important because I'm squaring it.

68
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,510
So, these, in my mind, are the two contenders.

69
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,530
The worst contender is

70
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,300
where we use the 6 and the 10 side as a base. RightŁż

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,420
Because then we use a lot of space.

72
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,080
But we can figure that one out, too.

73
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,300
Because then we waste a lot of space

74
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,090
and we have a height of 8 and the radius is still--.

75
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,000
So, first of all, this one is clearly better than this one.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,990
And why is that?

77
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,670
They have the same area of their base because the radius is 6

78
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,470
Sorry, the radius is 3, the diameter is 6.

79
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,380
But in here the height gets to be 10,

80
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,770
and here the height only gets to be 8.

81
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,440
So this one is a non-option.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,750
So, really, we have to compare these two.

83
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,650
And I've drawn their bases. RightŁż

84
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,200
So, if you think about this one,

85
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,220
we have an area of the base of the radius is 4.

86
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,560
So, 16 pi times the height of six. Time Six.

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
That's the volume of this cylinder.

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,770
Here we have a radius-- we have a radius of 3. Right?

89
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,570
Half of the 6 diameter.

90
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,010
So, the area is 9 pi.

91
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,240
And we're going to multiply that times the height,

92
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,040
which is 10.

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,620
So, here we have 90 pi.

94
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,040
And here we have 6 times 16, which is 96 pi.

95
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,730
So, this is the best of our cases.

96
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,200
And that was the correct intuition.

97
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,130
We're maximizing the radius.

98
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,080
And when you maximize the radius, we get a radius of 4.

99
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,660
So what did they ask us in the question again?

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,100
What is the radius in inches of the one

101
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,010
that has the maximum volume?

102
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,700
And so that radius is 4.

103
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,780
Where one side is 8 and one side is 10.

104
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,030
And that's choice B.

105
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,010
Next question.

106
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,880
192.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,990
Square root.

108
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,000
OK, they have all sorts of interesting things.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,570
They essentially want us to simplify.

110
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,990
The square root of 2 plus 1

111
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,870
times the square root of 2 minus 1

112
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,520
times the square root of 3 plus 1

113
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,000
times the square root of 3 minus 1.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,560
So, this seems to be just an application of--

115
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,260
I'm sure you've learned this in algebra--

116
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,810
that a plus b times a minus b

117
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,990
is equal to a squared minus b squared.

118
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,990
You don't have to memorize this.

119
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,000
You could actually multiply it all out and you'll get this.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,040
But it's a good thing to know if you want to do things quickly

121
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,710
So, square root of 2 plus 1, times square root of 2 minus one

122
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:03,070
is equal to square root of 2 squared, minus 1 squared.

123
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,530
We're going to multiply that times--

124
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,800
using the same principle--

125
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,030
square root of 3 squared minus one squared.

126
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,350
Square root of 2 squared.

127
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:20,000
That's 2 minus 1 times 3 minus 1.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,560
That's equal to 1 times 2.

129
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,040
Which is equal to 2.

130
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,060
And that is choice A.

131
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,170
Problem 193.

132
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,390
In a certain Calculus class,

133
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,130
the ratio of the number of math majors

134
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,050
to the number of students who are not math majors is 2:5.

135
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,010
So, math to not math is equal to 2:5.

136
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,280
If 2 more math majors were to enter the class

137
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,480
the ratio would be 1:2.

138
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,130
So if I have 2 more math majors,

139
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:01,000
then the ratio of them to the non-math majors is equal to 1:2

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,130
How many students are in the class?

141
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:10,340
They want to know what m plus nm, non-math majors, is.

142
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,630
Let's see. Let's see if we can solve for anything.

143
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,620
We actually have two linear equations and two unknowns.

144
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,050
You might not see it yet, but if we cross multiply we get 5m.

145
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,050
I'll just call these n, non-math majors.

146
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,010
I don't want to keep saying nm.

147
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,010
5m is equal to 2n.

148
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:32,140
And here you get 2 times m plus 2 is 2m plus 4 is equal to n.

149
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,010
We could substitute that.

150
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,130
If n is equal to that, then that means that

151
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:44,960
5m is equal to 2 times n. n is equal to 2m plus 4. 2m plus 4.

152
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,580
So, you get 5m is equal to 4m plus 8.

153
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,070
Subtract 4m from both sides, you get m is equal to 8.

154
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,210
If m is equal to 8, we could say 5m is equal to 2n.

155
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,020
So, 5 times 8 is 40.

156
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,980
And so n is equal to 20.

157
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,470
Let's see, are they asking for the--

158
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,400
if 2 more students were to enter the class?

159
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,240
OK. So they want to know how many are in the class right now.

160
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,630
So they want to know m plus n.

161
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,880
Well, that's equal to 8 plus 20 which is equal to 28 students

162
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,060
And that is choice D.

163
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,680
Next question.

164
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,010
I think I have time to fit this one in.

165
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,010
I'll continue in the next if I don't.

166
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,610
194.

167
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,700
What is the units digit of 13

168
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:47,000
to the fourth times 17 squared times 29 to the third?

169
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,230
So, here you just have to realize that the units digit

170
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,870
in any of these numbers, are just the units digit

171
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,830
of each of these numbers times each other.

172
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,580
And then you take the units digit of that.

173
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,010
So, we really just have to worry about the units digits.

174
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,290
The answer to this question would be the exact same thing

175
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,090
as if I said the units digit of 3 to the fourth.

176
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,640
We just have to worry about the units digits.

177
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,550
3 to the fourth times 7 squared times 9 to the third.

178
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,060
It would be the exact same thing.

179
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,580
So, 3 to the fourth, what's the units digit?

180
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,080
3 to the one is equal to 3.

181
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,610
3 squared is equal to 9.

182
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,400
3 to the third is 27, but the units digit is 7.

183
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,050
And then 3 to the fourth is 81 and the units digit is 1.

184
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,470
And just so you can see this principle

185
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,390
that I just talked about--

186
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,240
and we could prove it if I had more time--

187
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,100
is that I could just multiply 3 times 7

188
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,420
and the units digit is just 1.

189
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,700
Or I could just multiply 3 times 9 and the units digit is 7.

190
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,510
We could just ignore everything else.

191
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,080
So here the units digit is 1.

192
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,050
7 squared, what's the units digit?

193
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,220
Well, 7 squared, the units digit is-- well, 7 squared is 49.

194
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,070
The units digit is 9.

195
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,060
And then 9 to the third, what's the units digit?

196
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,020
9 to the 1 is 9.

197
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,670
9 squared.

198
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,010
The units digit is 1.

199
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,020
It's 81.

200
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,570
And then 9 to the third,

201
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,760
we don't have to worry about anything else.

202
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,340
When you multiply 81 times 9,

203
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,510
the units digit is going to be 9 times that 1 in 81.

204
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,500
So, that equals 9.

205
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,850
So, it's 1 times 9 times 9.

206
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,020
And then 9 times 9 is 81.

207
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,010
We want the units digit, which is 1.

208
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,880
So the answer is E.

209
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,550
And I'll let you think about that a little bit.

210
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,660
Maybe you want to play around

211
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,050
and see why we only have to worry about the units digit

212
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,850
and why I was able to make this statement right here

213
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,940
to avoid doing a lot of harder math.

214
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,010
Anyway, see you in the next video.
