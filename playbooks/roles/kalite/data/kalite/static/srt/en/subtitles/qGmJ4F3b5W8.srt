00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:04,760
Determine whether the points on this graph represent a function.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,522
Now just as a refresher a function is

3
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:12,516
really just an association between members of a set that we call

4
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:15,488
the domain and members of a set that we call a range.

5
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:21,850
So if I take any member of the domain, lets call that x, and I give it to the function,

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,429
the function should tell me

7
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,819
what member of my range is that associated with it.

8
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:30,488
So it should point to some other value. This is a function.

9
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,933
It would not be a function if it says "Well, it could point to y

10
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,503
or

11
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,175
it could point to z.

12
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:39,358
Or maybe it could point to e.

13
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:41,819
Or whatever else. This would not be a function.

14
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:48,089
Because over here, so this right over here is not a function. Because it's not clear if you

15
00:00:48,089 --> 99:59:59,999
input x, what member of the range are you going to get?
