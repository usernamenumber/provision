00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:07,400
Determine the domain and range for the relation described by the table

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,494
and so, what they want us to say, what they want us to figure out, when they say the domain

3
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:17,415
what are all the possible inputs that we could put into, this case, a relation

4
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:19,000
and later we'll see a function

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,333
and so over here, i guess one way to think about it

6
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,752
the inputs that this relationship is defined for

7
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:28,096
and so you can view the x as the input

8
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:30,511
so when x is -1, y is 3

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:32,763
when x is 3, y is -2

10
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:35,333
when x is 3, again, y is 2

11
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,243
that's why we can't describe this as a function

12
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:41,267
here because we have two y values for a given x value

13
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:42,800
but it can be a relation

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,667
when x is 4, y is 8

15
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:47,133
when x is 6, y is -1

16
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:51,827
so to answer the first part, when they ask us what is the domain of this relation

17
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:54,867
they're really just saying

18
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:59,200
what are all of the inputs, what are all of the x values for which this relation is defined?

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,667
and they list the x values over here

20
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:04,533
so it is a set, and that is what these curly brackets mean

21
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,467
that i'm about to describe a set

22
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:16,000
it is the set of the numbers -1, 3, 4, and 6

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,267
so all we're saying here

24
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,933
if we saying the domain of this relation is these 4 numbers

25
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:25,133
it says that this relation is defined for any of these four numbers

26
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:27,133
if you give any of these numbers as an x value

27
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:30,867
there is a y, at least one y value associated with it

28
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:35,202
now, when they talk about the range of this relation

29
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:42,467
and the idea also applies to functions, which are a more specific class of relations

30
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,533
you can view them as a well behaved relation

31
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:51,200
the range is all the possible output that this relation can give you

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,533
given the inputs, what are all the possible values that this relation can take on?

33
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:01,600
so here you'll take a look at all the possible y values that this relation can take on

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,200
we can write them in order, or we don't have to write them in order, but i'll just write them in order

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,498
actually let's just go straight this way

36
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:14,095
a set does not imply some type of order, it just means a collection of things

37
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:20,800
so the range here, well our y value can take on the value 3, it can take on the value 2, it can take

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,843
on the value 8, and it can take on the value -1

39
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:27,933
and we're done!

40
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:31,092
these are the x values for which this relation is defined

41
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:34,200
then you can actually find an association or relationship

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,667
and these are all the y values

43
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:40,067
these are kind of all the outputs of the relation that it can take on

44
00:02:40,067 --> 99:59:59,999
we just look right over here to find them
