1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,419
Say you're me in your math class,

2
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:02,913
and you're supposed to be graphing functions.

3
00:00:02,913 --> 00:00:05,136
As if there were some deep relationship

4
00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:05,801
between y and x that your teacher just

5
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:08,520
won't stop gossiping about.

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,007
But, like most gossip, you really don't

7
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:13,328
care about y's unhealthy dependency on x.

8
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:13,352
Really y, get a life.

9
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:15,704
Luckily, your friend passes you a note.

10
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:17,886
You wait till the teacher is facing the board

11
00:00:18,423 --> 00:00:19,015
and sneakily open it up.

12
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:19,281
And it's this proof that pi = 4

13
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:19,633
that you've seen billions of times on the Internet.

14
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,421
But because you're bored and

15
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,437
at least it's not graphing, you take

16
00:00:24,437 --> 00:00:26,503
another look.

17
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:27,870
It's like this: start with a circle,

18
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,891
with diameter 1 and circumference pi.

19
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:31,959
Then draw a square around it.

20
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:33,269
The length of a side of the square is 1,

21
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:34,975
so the perimeter of the square is, of course, 4.

22
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:36,293
Now you start approaching a circle by

23
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:36,587
zig-zagging this perimeter.

24
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:37,324
This shape still has perimeter 4.

25
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:39,251
And we do it again, and it's still 4.

26
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:39,509
And again, and we approach a circle.

27
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:39,721
While the perimeter never changes.

28
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:40,809
So there, 4, pi equals 4.

29
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,191
Obviously there's something wrong here.

30
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:46,173
The circumference of a circle is pi but

31
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:48,389
pi is more like 3.14 numbers and less like 4.

32
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:52,539
So somehow what this process approaches is something that looks like a circle but is not a circle.

33
00:00:52,539 --> 00:01:00,404
I mean, what does circle mean anyway?

34
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:04,057
There's this loopy line thing, and then there's this solid disc shape.

35
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:06,821
well there related an all there not the same mathematical object

36
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:13,122
this troll proof so much FUN because you repeat this zigzag move all the way to Zigfinity

37
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:21,054
it approaches the shape of a circle in a disc seance

38
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:22,942
an it approaches the area of a circle but it dose not approach a circle

39
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:25,540
its all crinceled up an if you imagined if you put a astral in this thing

40
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,585
an deflated it added as much air in it as you can wile keeping the primmer as 4

41
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:31,084
all the infinite ringcals would smooth out an you get a circle with a perimeter 4 an diameter 4 over pi

42
00:01:31,084 --> 00:03:38,139
in fact you can inflate the square to get the same thing
