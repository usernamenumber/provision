1
00:00:10,786 --> 00:00:12,703
Let's do a small experiment

2
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:16,894
Would you rather drink this water, or this water?

3
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:20,285
Well, of course you would choose the water on the left

4
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:23,669
Unfortunately, some people in other parts of the world have no choice at all

5
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:27,969
Did you know that small floating particles in drinking water can

6
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:31,753
make you sick? Imagine we have a super powerful microscope and we can

7
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:34,603
zoom into the water. ZOOM!

8
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:37,871
What will we find? What are these small, floating particles,

9
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,470
and how do they float? These particles are of two types:

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,036
inorganic (like clay, silt, and mineral oxides) and

11
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:49,287
organic (such as algae, protozoa, and bacteria).

12
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:53,870
The bacteria, once ingested by humans, can sometimes be fatal.

13
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,001
All of these small particles are able to float, because they are not heavy enough

14
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,804
to settle to the bottom by gravity. Suspended particles that are too

15
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:04,435
light and small to settle are called colloids.

16
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:09,971
When looked at together, these colloids cause a state of cloudiness

17
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:13,903
or haziness, known as turbidity. The more cloudy a fluid looks, the more

18
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:17,819
turbid it is. Here we see four beakers of

19
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,679
water with increasing levels of turbidity, from left to right.

20
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:26,148
There is a relation between turbidity and the risk of getting a disease.

21
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,953
Science shows that the more turbid

22
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:32,502
the drinking water is, the higher the risk of getting sick is.

23
00:01:32,502 --> 00:01:37,669
Now why is this? This is because toxic compounds can

24
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:41,919
adsorb, that is, stick to the surface of the suspended colloids.

25
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:46,070
The more colloids there are, the more toxic the water can become.

26
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,070
These toxic materials and bacteria can cause cholera,

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,971
salmonellosis, hepatitis A, dysentery,

28
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:58,385
and e-coli infection. These illnesses effect and kill

29
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:02,052
millions of people a year, and are especially dangerous to children, whose weak

30
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:05,469
immune systems cannot provide an adequate defense.

31
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:09,869
Fortunately, we can do something about this! One of the very

32
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,871
practical ways to clean this turbid water is called flocculation

33
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:17,985
Flocculation is the process in which colloids aggregate,

34
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:21,787
or come together to form larger particles called flocks, by the addition

35
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:26,269
of a chemical called a flocculant. Typical flocculants

36
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,537
include Alum and Ferrix, because they work well with high turbidity fluid mixtures

37
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:36,836
Now, let's demonstrate how flocculation works. First, we'll need

38
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:40,163
to go out and collect some muddy water from the Charles River

39
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:45,669
Here are two beakers filled with the same amount of muddy Charles River water

40
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:49,186
On the left is our control, which will remain untouched,

41
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:53,484
and on the right, we'll add 3mL of prepared flocculant solution

42
00:02:53,484 --> 00:03:00,349
Then we'll stir for two minutes, and wait

43
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,252
Wow! What just happened?

44
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:17,120
The colloids in the turbid water on the left may never settle

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,613
whereas, with the addition of just a little bit of flocculant

46
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:22,519
the water on the right became clear.

47
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,086
In order to make this water potable, it will require skimming and filtration

48
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:30,056
and maybe some additional treatment

49
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,585
If you're wondering what's going on, let's explain how this flocculant business works.

50
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:38,885
Almost all colloids have negatively charged surfaces

51
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,685
This means that positive ions, or charged particles in water

52
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:46,936
will attract to the colloid surface, forming a first layer.

53
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:52,103
Recall how like poles of a magnet will repel, while opposite poles will attract.

54
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:55,086
The same occurs with colloids in water.

55
00:03:55,086 --> 00:04:00,402
A diffuse layer, made up of a mix of positive and negative ions will then surround the first

56
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:07,871
forming what is called a double layer.

57
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:13,085
This double layer provides a repulsive force which prevents two colloids from sticking to each other.

58
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:23,492
Once the flocculant is added, it adheres to the surfaces of the particles,

59
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:29,054
compressing the double layer,

60
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:33,969
and allowing the colloids to stick to each other and form "flocks"

61
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:37,453
These flocks are now heavy enough to settle to the bottom by gravity.

62
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:40,735
Given how effective flocculation is, many countries around the world

63
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:43,485
use this method for cleaning their water supplies.

64
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:48,003
Did you know that Singapore, for instance, produces drinking water from sewer water

65
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:52,234
using a number of methods, including flocculation?

66
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:54,070
As the global population increases

67
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,069
and freshwater resources become more and more scarce

68
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:02,402
flocculation is one tool that can supply clean, healthy, and tasty drinking water

69
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,635
worldwide.
