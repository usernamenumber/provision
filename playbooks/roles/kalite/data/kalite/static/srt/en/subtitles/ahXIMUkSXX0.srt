1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:01,743
Say you're me and you're in math class.

2
00:00:01,743 --> 00:00:02,890
And your teacher's talking about –

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,525
Well, who knows what your teacher's talking about.

4
00:00:04,525 --> 00:00:05,906
Probably a good time to start doodling.

5
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,207
And you're feeling spirally today.

6
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,138
So, yeah.

7
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:09,763
Oh, and because of overcrowding in your school,

8
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:12,203
your math class is taking place in Green House #3.

9
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:13,167
Plants.

10
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,395
Anyway, you've decided there are

11
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:16,039
three basic types of spirals.

12
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,491
There's the kind where, as you spiral out,

13
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:18,374
you keep the same distance.

14
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:19,191
Or you could start big,

15
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:20,672
but make it tighter and tighter as you go around –

16
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,199
in which case the spiral ends.

17
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,657
Or you could start tight,

18
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,239
but make the spiral bigger as you go out.

19
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,466
The first kind is good if you really

20
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:28,001
want to fill up a page with lines –

21
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,430
or if you want to draw curled up snakes.

22
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,396
You can start with a wonky shape to spiral around.

23
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:33,131
But you've noticed that as you spiral out,

24
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:34,512
it gets rounder and rounder.

25
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:35,670
Probably something to do with how

26
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,552
the ratio between two different numbers approaches 1

27
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:38,387
as you repeatedly add the same number to both.

28
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:39,805
But you can bring the wonk back

29
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:41,361
by exaggerating the bumps –

30
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:43,548
and it gets all optical illusiony.

31
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:44,934
Anyway, you're not sure what

32
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,087
the second kind of spiral's good for.

33
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,289
But I guess it's a good way to draw

34
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:48,661
snuggled up 'slug cats' –

35
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:49,679
which are a species you've invented

36
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,737
just to keep this kind of spiral from feeling useless.

37
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:55,256
This third spiral, however, is good for all sorts of things.

38
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,426
You could draw a snail, or a nautilus shell –

39
00:00:57,426 --> 00:00:58,767
an elephant with a curled up trunk,

40
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,408
the horns of a sheep,a fern frond,

41
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:03,435
a cochlea in an inner ear diagram – an ear itself,

42
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:05,307
Those other spirals can't help but be jealous

43
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:07,384
of this clearly superior kind of spiral.

44
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:09,044
Better draw more slug cats.

45
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:11,354
Here's one way to draw a really perfect spiral:

46
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:12,410
Start with one square –

47
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,745
and draw another next to it that is the same height.

48
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:17,325
Make the next square with it next to both together –

49
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,213
that is, each side is length 2.

50
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,653
The next square has length 3.

51
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:23,189
The entire outside shape will always be a rectangle.

52
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,835
Keep spiraling around, adding bigger and bigger squares.

53
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,397
This one has side length [COUNTS TO] 13 –

54
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:31,739
and now, 21.

55
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:32,323
Once you do that,

56
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:34,370
you can add a curve going through each square,

57
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,324
arcing from one corner to the opposite corner.

58
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:38,882
Resist the urge to zip quickly across the diagonal

59
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:40,655
if you want a nice smooth spiral.

60
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:42,078
Have you ever looked at the spirally pattern

61
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:43,594
on a pine cone and thought:

62
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:45,264
"Hey! There sure are spirals on this pine cone!"?

63
00:01:45,264 --> 00:01:47,333
(I don't know why there are pine cones in your greenhouse.

64
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,663
Maybe the greenhouse is in a forest.)

65
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:49,725
Anyway, there are spirals.

66
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:51,047
And there's not just one, either.

67
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:53,326
There are [COUNTS TO] 8 going this way.

68
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:55,315
Or you could look at the spirals going the other way,

69
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:59,091
and there's [COUNTS TO] 13.

70
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:00,208
Look familiar?

71
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,817
8 and 13 are both numbers in the 'Fibonacci series.'

72
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:05,195
That's the one where you start by adding 1 and 1 to get 2 –

73
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:06,353
then 1 and 2 to get 3.

74
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:07,570
2 and 3 to get 5.

75
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,417
3 + 5 is 8.

76
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,127
5 + 8 is 13.

77
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:11,070
And so on.

78
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,185
Some people think that instead of starting by adding 1 + 1,

79
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:15,533
you should start with 0 and 1.

80
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,658
0 + 1 = 1.

81
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:17,358
1 + 1 = 2.

82
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:18,412
2 + 1 = 3.

83
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:21,558
And it continues on the same way as starting with 1 + 1.

84
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,711
Or I guess you could start with 1 + 0

85
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:24,761
and that would work, too.

86
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:27,397
Or why not go back one more to -1, and so on?

87
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,282
Anyway, if you're into the Fibonacci series,

88
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,753
you probably have a bunch of it memorized.

89
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:32,901
I mean, you've got to know 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.

90
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,455
Finish off the single digits with 8.

91
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,440
And, ooh, 13. How spooky!

92
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,691
And once you're memorizing double digits,

93
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,327
you might as well know 21, 34, 55, 89 –

94
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,296
so that whenever someone turns a Fibonacci number,

95
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,318
you can say, "Happy Fib-birthday!"

96
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,426
And then, isn't it interesting that 144, 233, 377 ... ?

97
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:50,204
(But 610 breaks that pattern.

98
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,338
So you better know that one too.)

99
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,474
And – oh my goodness – 987 is a neat number.

100
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,757
And well, you see how these things get out of hand.

101
00:02:55,757 --> 00:02:56,978
Anyway, 'tis the season for

102
00:02:56,978 --> 00:02:58,837
decorative scented pine cones.

103
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:00,514
And if you're putting glitter-glue spirals on your pine cones –

104
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,849
uh, during math class –

105
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,550
you might notice that the number of spirals are 5 and 8 –

106
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,352
or 3 and 5 –

107
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,951
a or 3 and 5 again –

108
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:07,782
5 and 8.

109
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:09,323
This one was 8 and 13.

110
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,891
And one Fibonacci pine cone is one thing.

111
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:11,943
But all of them?

112
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,555
What is up with that?

113
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:15,467
This pine cone has this wumpy, weird part.

114
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,437
Maybe that messes it up.

115
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:18,132
Let's count the top. 5 and 8.

116
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,169
Now let's check out the bottom. 8 and 13.

117
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,816
If you wanted to draw a mathematically realistic pine cone,

118
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:24,806
you might start by drawing 5 spirals going one way,

119
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:26,389
and 8 going the other.

120
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:27,941
I'm going to mark out starting and ending points

121
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,881
for my spirals first – as a guide –

122
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:31,111
and then draw the arms –

123
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,557
8 one way and 5 the other.

124
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:34,444
Now I can fill in the little pine coney things.

125
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:36,323
So there are Fibonacci numbers in pine cones.

126
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,802
But are there Fibonacci numbers

127
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,112
in other things that start with 'pine?'

128
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:40,721
Let's count the spirals on this thing.

129
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,170
[COUNTS TO] 8.

130
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,986
And [COUNTS TO] 13.

131
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:48,495
The leaves are hard to keep track of.

132
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,996
But they're in spirals too –

133
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,064
of Fibonacci numbers.

134
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,800
What if we looked at these really tight spirals

135
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,004
going almost straight up?

136
00:03:54,004 --> 00:03:59,565
[COUNTS TO] 21 –

137
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:00,956
a Fibonacci number.

138
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:02,789
Can we find a third spiral on this pine cone?

139
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,418
Sure. Go down like this and –

140
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:09,939
[COUNTS TO] 21.

141
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,328
But that's only a couple of examples.

142
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:13,299
How about this thing I found on the side of the road?

143
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,551
I don't know what it is.

144
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:15,921
It probably starts with 'pine' though...

145
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,044
5 and 8.

146
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:18,546
Let's see how far the conspiracy goes.

147
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:19,774
What else has spirals in it?

148
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:20,995
This artichoke has 5 and 8.

149
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,894
So does this artichoke-looking flower thing.

150
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,642
And this cactus fruit does, too.

151
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:26,546
Here's an orange cauliflower with 5 and 8.

152
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,012
And a green one with 5 and 8.

153
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:29,140
I mean 5 and 8.

154
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,438
Oh, it's actually 5 and 8.

155
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,153
Maybe plants just like these numbers, though.

156
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:35,703
Doesn't mean it has anything to do with Fibonacci, does it?

157
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,097
So let's go for some higher numbers.

158
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:38,260
We're going to need some flowers.

159
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,519
I think this is a flower.

160
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,686
It's got 13 and 21.

161
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:41,797
These daisies are hard to count.

162
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:43,385
But they have 21 and 34.

163
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,104
Now, let's bring in the big guns.

164
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:54,842
[COUNTS TO] 34.

165
00:04:54,842 --> 00:05:02,796
And [COUNTS TO] 55.

166
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:04,117
I promise this is a random flower –

167
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:05,792
and I didn't pick it out specially to trick you

168
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,869
into thinking there are Fibonacci numbers in things.

169
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:09,232
But you should really count for yourself

170
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:11,255
next time you see something spirally.

171
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,458
There are even Fibonacci numbers in

172
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,634
how the leaves are arranged on this stalk.

173
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:15,368
Or this one.

174
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:16,927
Or the Brussels sprouts on this stalk

175
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,039
are a beautiful, delicious 3 and 5.

176
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,473
Fibonacci is even in the arrangement

177
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:21,882
of the petals on this rose.

178
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,692
And some flowers have shown Fibonacci numbers

179
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,901
as high as 144.

180
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,091
It's seems pretty cosmic and wondrous,

181
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,315
but the cool thing about the Fibonacci series and spiral

182
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:32,788
is not that it's this big, complicated, mystical, magical,

183
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:34,339
super math thing, beyond the comprehension

184
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,409
of our puny human minds,

185
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,313
that shows up mysteriously everywhere.

186
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:39,591
We'll find that these numbers aren't weird at all.

187
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:42,553
In fact, it would be weird if they weren't there.

188
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:44,816
The cool thing about it is that these incredibly

189
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:46,515
intricate patterns can result

190
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:49,499
from utterly simple beginnings.
