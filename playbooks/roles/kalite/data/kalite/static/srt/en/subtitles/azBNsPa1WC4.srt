1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets say that this is an equilateral triangle and

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what I want to do is make another shape out of

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this equilateral traingle and I'm gonna do that

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by taking each of the sides of this triangle

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and divide them into three equal sections

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
into three equal sections

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so, my equilateral triangle wasn't drawn

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
super ideally but I think you'll get the point

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the middle section I want to construct

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
another equilateral triangle

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the middle section right over here

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I am going to construct another equilateral triangle

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so its going to look something like this

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then right over here I'm gonna put

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
another equilateral triangle, and so now I went

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from that equilateral triangle to something that

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
looking like a star or a star of David.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then I'm gonna do it again

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so each of the sides now I'm going to divide into

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
three equal sides, and that middle segment

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm gonna put an equilateral triangle

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm going to put an equilateral triangle

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so in the middle segment I'm going to put an

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equilateral triangle, so I'm gonna do it for

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
everyone one the sides, so let me do it... right there

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and right there, I think you get the idea but

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to make it clear, so let me just so then

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like that, and then like that, like that

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then almost done for this iteration, this pass

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then it'll look that, but then I can do it again

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
each of the segments I can divide into three equal

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sides and draw another equilateral triangle

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so I could there, there, there, there, there

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think you see where this is going.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so I can keep going on forever and forever

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what I want to do in this video is think about whats

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going on here. And what I'm actually drawing, if we just

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
keep on doing this forever and forever. Every

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
every iteration if we look at each side. We

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
divided it into three eequal sides and then the next iteration

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with three equal segments, the next iteration, the middle

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
segment would turn into another equilateral triangle

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this shape that we're describing right here is called a

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
koch snowflake, I'm sure im mispronouncing the koch

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
part. the koch snowflake was first described by this

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
gentleman right over here who was a swedish

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
mathematician, Niels Fabian Helge von Koch

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well, I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it. And this is one of

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the earliest described fractals, so this is a fractal. And

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the reason why it is considered a fractal is that it looks

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the same, or it looks very similar, on any scale you look

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at it. So when you look at it at this scale, so if you look

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at this it looks like you see a bunch of triangles with

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some bumps on it, but then if you were to zoom in

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over there then you would still see that same type

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of pattern. And then if you were to zoom it again, you

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
would see it again and again. So a fractal is anything that

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on any scale or any level of zoom it kind of looks roughly

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the same. So that's why it's called a fractal. Now what's

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
particularly interesting and why I'm putting at this point

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the geometry playlist is that this actually has an

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
infinite perimeter. If you were to keep doing it if you

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
actually wanted to make the Koch snowflake were you

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
keep an infinite number of times on every smaller little

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
triangle here you keep adding another equilateral

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
triangle on its side. And to show that it has an equal

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
perimeter, lets just consider one side over here. So let's

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
say that this side, let's say we're starting with that
