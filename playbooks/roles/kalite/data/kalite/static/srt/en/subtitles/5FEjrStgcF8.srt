00:00:00,113 --> 00:00:02,938
The purpose of this video is to just begin

2
00:00:02,938 --> 00:00:08,015
to appreciate how vast and enourmous the universe is;

3
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:09,683
and frankly, our brains really can't grasp it

4
00:00:09,683 --> 00:00:12,267
but we'll see in this video is that we can't even grasp things

5
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:14,933
that are super-small compared to the size of the universe

6
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,933
and we actually don't even know what the entire size

7
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,537
of the universe is.

8
00:00:18,537 --> 00:00:19,434
But with that said,

9
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:21,136
let's actually just try to appreciate how small we are.

10
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:23,099
So this is me right over here.

11
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:29,017
I am 5' 9", depending on whether I'm wearing shoes.

12
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:30,433
(maybe five foot ten with shoes)

13
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:32,934
But for the sake of this video let's just roughly approximate

14
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:35,933
around six feet or around roughly,

15
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,604
I'm not going to go into the details

16
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,934
of the math, around 2 meters. Now If I were to lie down

17
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:45,405
ten times in a row, you've get about the length of a

18
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:47,683
18 wheeler, it's about 60 feet long. So this is

19
00:00:47,683 --> 00:00:52,205
times ten. Now if you were to put an 18 wheeler;

20
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:54,138
kind of if you were to

21
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:56,137
make it tall as opposed to long, somehow to stand it up

22
00:00:56,137 --> 00:01:00,267
and you were to do that 10 times in a row, you'll get to the height of

23
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:03,683
roughly a 60 story skyscrapper. So once again,

24
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:07,349
if you took me and you piled me up a hundred times,

25
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:11,472
you'll get about a 60 story skyscrapper. Now if you took that skyscrapper

26
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,600
and if you were to lie it down

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,100
ten times in a row, you'd get something of the length

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,734
of the Golden Gate bridge

29
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:23,433
Once again I'm not giving you the exact numbers. It is not always going to be exactly 10

30
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:28,472
But we are now getting to about something that is a little on the order of a mile long

31
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:31,017
The Golden Gate bridge is actually longer than a mile, but if you go

32
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:37,266
within the twin span, it is roughly about a mile. Actually it is a little longer than that. But that gives you a sense of a mile.

33
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:42,383
Now if you multiply that by 10, you get to the size of a large city.

34
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:49,782
And this right here is a satellite photograph of San Francisco. This is the actual Golden Gate bridge here.

35
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:55,858
And when I copy and pasted this picture I try to make it roughly 10 miles by 10 miles, so you appreciate the scale.

36
00:01:55,858 --> 00:02:06,928
What is interesting here... and this picture is interesting because this is the first time we can kind of relate to cities when you look at the city of this scale starting to get larger

37
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:17,379
than what we're used to processing on a daily basis. This is a bridge. We've been on a bridge. We know what a bridge looks like. We know that a bridge is huge, but it doesn't feel like something that we can comprehend.
