1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,467
So I've drawn an arbitrary triangle,

2
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:07,800
that we will assume is NOT an equilateral triangle,

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,000
and let's draw some of the interesting properties of this triangle.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,452
So let's first start with the perpendicular bisectors.

5
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:18,815
So let's say this is the midpoint of this side,

6
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:23,092
so, let me draw it a little bit closer to the midpoint, it looks like right about there.

7
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:26,885
So this length is equal to this length right over here.

8
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:30,000
And so let me draw a perpendicular bisector.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,364
So the perpendicular bisector would look something like that, for that side.

10
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,636
Now let me do it on this side.

11
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:40,097
So, just trying to eyeball it, this looks roughly like the midpoint.

12
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:43,200
So this length is going to be equal to this length.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,733
And then, once again, let me draw a perpendicular bisector.

14
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:49,467
So, it's going to go at a 90 degree angle.

15
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,821
I can draw a straighter line than that.

16
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:54,400
That looks pretty good...

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,067
and it is perpendicular.

18
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:59,600
And then, you could imagine, I will do it with this side, with side AB.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,467
That looks like the midpoint.

20
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:05,000
This length is going to be equal to that length.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,450
And then if we draw a perpendicular,

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,933
(my best attempt to draw this),

23
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:14,000
it looks something like that,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,133
and we've already learned that these three lines

25
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:18,733
will definitely intersect in a unique point,

26
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:22,200
right over there, which we call the circumcenter.

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,185
So let me write it.

28
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:27,600
So this is our circumcenter.

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,267
This is nothing new.

30
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:34,000
Now let's draw the medians.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,600
The medians go from each of the vertices to the,

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,933
to the midpoint of the opposite side.

33
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,067
So let me draw,

34
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,267
so this is a median,

35
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:47,000
this is a median...

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
this is a median,

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,487
and then this is...

38
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:58,333
and all the errors in my drawing will start to become apparent,

39
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,533
now that I'm trying to do multiple things with it,

40
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:04,933
but we know all of the medians intersect at the centroid.

41
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:08,738
So this right over here is the centroid.

42
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:11,990
Now let's draw the altitudes of this triangle.

43
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,934
So let's draw the altitudes.

44
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,406
So I'm gonna drop a perpendicular right over here.

45
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:18,667
This is one altitude.

46
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,239
I will draw another altitude.

47
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,077
So remember, it's just gonna go down like this.

48
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:27,407
Draw another altitude, it'd look something like that.

49
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:30,989
And then I can draw another altitude from this side,

50
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,739
and we know it's going to intersect at this unique point right over here.

51
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,157
So I'll try to draw it as neatly as I can.

52
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,667
And this is going to be perpendicular,

53
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,489
although the way I've drawn it doesn't necessarily look that way.

54
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:48,202
And we know that this thing is called an orthocenter.

55
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,575
Now, the whole reason why I'm doing this,

56
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:53,335
and this is frankly kind of a mind-boggling idea...

57
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:56,668
It's neat enough that each of these points even exists,

58
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:59,601
that the three altitudes will intersect in one point,

59
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:01,735
the three medians intersect in one point,

60
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:03,740
and they have all these neat properties,

61
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,929
and that the three perpendicular bisectors intersect in one point.

62
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,928
That by itself is neat enough.

63
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,329
But what's really neat,

64
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:11,654
and it's maybe not completely apparent by the way I drew it,

65
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:12,863
because I just drew it freehand,

66
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:18,664
is that these three points will definitely be on the same line.

67
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:21,261
If this was an equilateral triangle, they would actually be the same point.

68
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:24,406
But for any other triangle, they will be different points

69
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:26,997
and they will be on the same line,

70
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,154
which is just kind of crazy,

71
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:29,906
because obviously two points define a line,

72
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:32,663
but three points being on the same line is kind of a...

73
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:36,071
you know, it seems like a very unlikely thing,

74
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:36,997
if you were to just guess it.

75
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:40,262
And I'll just try to draw as best as I can.

76
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,863
If you were to draw this with a straight-edged ruler,

77
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:43,404
it would come out a lot cleaner,

78
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:48,129
but these, all three points sit on this unique line.

79
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,129
You know, it seems there's something special or magical about it.

80
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,128
And because it's something special or magical,

81
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:53,724
there's one famous mathematician

82
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:57,459
who tends to get all of the most special mathematical things named after him,

83
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,926
because he's the guy who's really explored these things,

84
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:05,527
and we call this the Euler line.

85
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:13,331
And I say that Leonhard Euler

86
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:20,592
gets all of the cool and magical, mystical things named after him

87
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:25,568
because he is also responsible for Euler's identity,

88
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:29,657
which is: e^(iπ)=-1

89
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:31,818
And we prove this in the calculus playlist.

90
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:33,150
And if none of this makes any sense to you,

91
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,126
don't worry, we're only in geometry right now.

92
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,484
But he gets to have all of them.

93
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:43,124
This is a magical thing because "e" comes out of compound interest, and exponential growth and decay;

94
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:47,732
"i" squared is negative one, it seems this very bizarre, imaginary number;

95
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:52,256
π ("pi") is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter,

96
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:54,151
and -1 is, well, negative one.

97
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:57,323
And so, Euler showed that there's a lot of reason to believe

98
00:04:57,323 --> 00:05:02,569
that these four numbers that come from all of these different, weird realities of the world

99
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,068
are connected in this very tight way,

100
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:10,068
and he also showed that these special points are all on the same line,

101
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:13,855
which tells us something kind of crazy and mystical about our reality.

102
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,105
And if that is not enough for you,

103
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:19,057
if you take the midpoint on the Euler line,

104
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:21,694
between the orthocenter and the circumcenter

105
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:24,521
(and I'm not going to prove it here, I'm just going to give you a little bit of a tidbit of it)

106
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:27,856
If you take the midpoint between the orthocenter and the circumcenter,

107
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:31,125
so I'm gonna try to look at it roughly,

108
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,656
so it looks like it's right about there.

109
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:35,606
So this length is going to be equal to this length.

110
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:38,942
This point that sits on the Euler line

111
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:43,272
is going to be the center of something called the 9-point circle,

112
00:05:43,272 --> 00:05:46,689
which intersects this triangle at nine points.

113
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:49,272
And we'll see, these nine kind of interesting points.

114
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:51,457
So let me label that as well.

115
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:55,023
So it's cool enough that these three special points are on the Euler line,

116
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,258
but there are actually four special points,

117
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:58,656
and actually there are a few more than that, that are kind of interesting.

118
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:05,356
So that orange point is the center of the 9-point circle.

119
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:08,939
And maybe I'll do another video just on that.

120
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:12,030
So anyway, hopefully you found that kind of interesting.
