1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,500
We have the absolute value of
2r minus 3 and 1/4 is less

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,990
than 2 and 1/2, and we
want to solve for r.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,940
So right from the get go we
have to deal with this

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,850
absolute value.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,290
And just as a bit of a review,
if I were to say that the

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,220
absolute value of x is less
than, well let's just say,

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,500
less than 2 and 1/2, that means
that the distance from x

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,750
to 0 is less than 2 and 1/2.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:32,566
That means that x would have to
be less than 2 and 1/2, and

11
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:36,850
x would have to be greater
than negative 2 and 1/2.

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,620
And just think about
it for a second.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,250
If I were to draw it on a number
line right here, that

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:50,030
is 0, that is 2 and 1/2, and
that is negative 2 and 1/2.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,600
These two numbers are exactly 2
and 1/2 away from 0, because

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,470
both of their absolute
values is 2 and 1/2.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,940
Now, if we want all of the
numbers whose absolute value

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,450
is less than 2 and 1/2, or that
are less than 2 and 1/2

19
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,420
away from 0, it would be all
of the numbers in between.

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,490
   

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,380
And that's exactly what these
two statements are saying. x

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,410
has to be less than 2 and 1/2,
and it has to be greater than

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,080
negative 2 and 1/2.

24
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,140
If this absolute value were
the other way, that the

25
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,313
absolute value of x has to be
greater than 2 and 1/2, then

26
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:23,200
it would be the numbers
outside of this, and

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,270
it would be an or.

28
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,590
But we're dealing with the
less than situation right

29
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,820
there, so let's just do what
we were able to figure out

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,990
when it was just an x.

31
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,930
The distance from this thing to
0 has to be less than 2 and

32
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:45,990
1/2, so we can write that 2r
minus 3 and 1/4 has to be less

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:55,610
than 2 and 1/2 and 2r minus 3
and 1/4 has to be greater than

34
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,090
negative 2 and 1/2.

35
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,540
Same exact reasoning here.

36
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,460
Let me draw a line so we
don't get confused.

37
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,050
Same exact reasoning here.

38
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,940
This quantity right here
has to be between

39
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,180
negative 2 and 1/2.

40
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,820
It has to be greater
than negative 2

41
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,470
and 1/2 right there.

42
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,060
And it has to be less
than 2 and 1/2, so

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,320
that's all I wrote there.

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,450
So let's solve each of
these independently.

45
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,340
Well, this first went over here,
you've learned before

46
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,370
that I don't like improper
fractions, and I don't like

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,300
fractions in general.

48
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,710
So let's make all of
these fractions.

49
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,010
Sorry, I don't like
mixed numbers.

50
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,490
I want them to be improper
fractions.

51
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,780
So let's turn all of these
into improper fractions.

52
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,940
So if I were to rewrite it, we
get 2r minus 3 and 1/4 is the

53
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,680
same thing as 3 times 4
is 12, plus 1 is 13.

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:50,420
2r minus 13/4 is less than-- 2
times 2 is 4, plus 1 is five--

55
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,600
is less than 5/2.

56
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,280
So that's the first equation.

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,320
And then the second question--
and do the same thing here--

58
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,130
we have 2r minus 13 over
4 has to be a greater

59
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,870
than negative 5/2.

60
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,040
All right, now let's solve each
of these independently.

61
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,640
To get rid of the fractions, the
easiest thing to do is to

62
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,080
multiply both sides of
this equation by 4.

63
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,730
That'll eliminate all of the
fractions, so let's do that.

64
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,800
Let's multiply-- let me scroll
to the left a little bit--

65
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,190
let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 4.

66
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,760
And what do we get?

67
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,840
4 times 2r is 8r, 4 times
negative 13 over 4 is negative

68
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,010
13, is less than-- and I
multiplied by a positive

69
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,270
number so I didn't have to
worry about swapping the

70
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:40,620
inequality-- is less than 5/2
times 4 is 10, right?

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,980
You get a 2 and a 1, it's 10.

72
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,430
So you get 8r minus 13
is less than 10.

73
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,090
Now we can add 13 to both sides
of this equation so that

74
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,710
we get rid of it on the
left-hand side.

75
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,460
Add 13 to both sides and we
get 8r-- these guys cancel

76
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,010
out-- is less than 23,
and then we divide

77
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,290
both sides by 8.

78
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,620
   

79
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,790
And once again, we didn't have
to worry about the inequality

80
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,380
because we're dividing
by a positive number.

81
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,100
And we get r is less
than 23 over 8.

82
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,160
Or, if you want to write that
as a mixed number, r is less

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,070
than-- what is that--
2 and 7/8.

84
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,390
So that's one condition, but we
still have to worry about

85
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,230
this other condition.

86
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,410
There was an and right here.

87
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,820
Let's worry about it.

88
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,120
So our other condition tells us
2r minus 13 over 4 has to

89
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,540
be greater than negative 5/2.

90
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,600
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 4.

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,790
So 4 times 2r is 8r.

92
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,080
4 times negative 13 over 4 is
negative 13, is greater than

93
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,680
negative 5/2 times
4 is negative 10.

94
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,013
Now we add 13 to both sides
of this equation.

95
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:59,640
   

96
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,040
The left-hand side-- these guys
cancel out, you're just

97
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,400
left with 8r-- is greater than
negative 10 plus 13 is 3.

98
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,750
Or divide both sides of this by
8, and you're left with r

99
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,450
has to be greater than 3/8.

100
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,100
So our two conditions, r has to
be less than 2 and 7/8 and

101
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,380
greater than 3/8.

102
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,420
Or we can just write it like
this: r is greater than 3/8,

103
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,980
so it's greater than-- maybe I
should say 3/8 is less than r,

104
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,860
which is less than 2 and 7/8.

105
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,045
So if we were to plot the
solution on the number line--

106
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:44,490
which I'm about to do, so that's
my number line-- this

107
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:51,990
is 0 right here, maybe
this is 1, 2, and 3.

108
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,450
We have 2 and 7/8.

109
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,980
We have to be less
than 2 and 7/8.

110
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's say that this is 2
and 7/8 right there.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,760
And we have to be greater
than 3/8.

112
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,490
Say that is 3/8, so 3/8
will be some place

113
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,790
right around there.

114
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,415
And everything in between
is a valid solution.

115
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:12,520
   

116
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,590
And we could try it out.

117
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,970
Let's try out something that,
based on what I just drew,

118
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,110
should be a valid solution.

119
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,990
1 should be a valid solution.

120
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,830
Let's try it out here.

121
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:26,070
2 times 1 minus 3 and
1/4, what is that?

122
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,570
That's 2 minus 3 and 1/4.

123
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,890
And so what is that?

124
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:36,690
2 minus 3 and 1/4 is-- well, 3
and 1/4 minus 2 is 1 and 1/4,

125
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,790
so this will be negative
1 and 1/4.

126
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,580
But we're taking the absolute
value of it, so we take the

127
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,620
absolute value of it, which is
equal to 1 and 1/4, which is

128
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,890
indeed less than 2 and 1/2.

129
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,200
Now let's try another number.

130
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,020
Let's try 0.

131
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,590
Based on this, 0 should
not work.

132
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,580
So what happens if
we put 0 here?

133
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,930
You get 2 times 0, which
is 0, minus 3 and 1/4.

134
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,420
If you take the absolute value
of negative 3 and 1/4, you'll

135
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,580
get positive 3 and 1/4,
which won't work.

136
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,250
3 and 1/4 is greater than
2 and 1/2, so that's

137
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,850
true, that works out.

138
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,480
And same thing for 3.

139
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,870
2 times 3 is 6, minus 3
and 1/4 is 2 and 3/4.

140
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,020
Take the absolute value, it's 2
and 3/4, still bigger than 2

141
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,460
and 1/2, so it won't work.

142
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,770
So at least the points that we
tried out seem to validate

143
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,160
this solution that we got.

144
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,266
