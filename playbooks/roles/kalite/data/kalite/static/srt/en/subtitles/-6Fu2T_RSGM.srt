1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
   

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,250
A line passes through the points
negative 3, 6 and 6, 0.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,390
Find the equation of this line
in point slope form, slope

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,860
intercept form, standard form.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,970
And the way to think about
these, these are just three

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,030
different ways of writing
the same equation.

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,220
So if you give me one of them,
we can manipulate it to get

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,230
any of the other ones.

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,890
But just so you know what these
are, point slope form,

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,500
let's say the point x1, y1 are,
let's say that that is a

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,160
point on the line.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,900
And when someone puts this
little subscript here, so if

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,750
they just write an x, that means
we're talking about a

14
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,690
variable that can take
on any value.

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,770
If someone writes x with a
subscript 1 and a y with a

16
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,150
subscript 1, that's like saying
a particular value x

17
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,450
and a particular value of y,
or a particular coordinate.

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,030
And you'll see that when
we do the example.

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,480
But point slope form says
that, look, if I know a

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,020
particular point, and if I know
the slope of the line,

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,750
then putting that line in point
slope form would be y

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:05,209
minus y1 is equal to
m times x minus x1.

23
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,830
So, for example, and we'll do
that in this video, if the

24
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,170
point negative 3 comma 6 is on
the line, then we'd say y

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,510
minus 6 is equal to m times x
minus negative 3, so it'll end

26
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,120
up becoming x plus 3.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,115
So this is a particular
x, and a particular y.

28
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:25,130
It could be a negative
3 and 6.

29
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,870
So that's point slope form.

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,790
Slope intercept form is y is
equal to mx plus b, where once

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,810
again m is the slope, b is the
y-intercept-- where does the

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,180
line intersect the y-axis--
what value does y take

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,680
on when x is 0?

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,680
And then standard form is the
form ax plus by is equal to c,

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,810
where these are just two
numbers, essentially.

36
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,960
They really don't have
any interpretation

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,430
directly on the graph.

38
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,710
So let's do this, let's figure
out all of these forms. So the

39
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,900
first thing we want to do
is figure out the slope.

40
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,610
Once we figure out the slope,
then point slope form is

41
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,820
actually very, very, very
straightforward to calculate.

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,120
So, just to remind ourselves,
slope, which is equal to m,

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,110
which is going to be equal to
the change in y over the

44
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,480
change in x.

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,940
Now what is the change in y?

46
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,610
If we view this as our end
point, if we imagine that we

47
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,190
are going from here to
that point, what is

48
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,460
the change in y?

49
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,860
Well, we have our end point,
which is 0, y ends up at the

50
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,300
0, and y was at 6.

51
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,650
So, our finishing y point is 0,
our starting y point is 6.

52
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,870
What was our finishing x
point, or x-coordinate?

53
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,810
Our finishing x-coordinate
was 6.

54
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,690
Let me make this very clear, I
don't want to confuse you.

55
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:53,720
So this 0, we have that 0, that
is that 0 right there.

56
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,330
And then we have this 6, which
was our starting y point, that

57
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,580
is that 6 right there.

58
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,000
And then we want our finishing x
value-- that is that 6 right

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,050
there, or that 6 right there--
and we want to subtract from

60
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,080
that our starting x value.

61
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,800
Well, our starting x value is
that right over there, that's

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,910
that negative 3.

63
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,880
And just to make sure we know
what we're doing, this

64
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,440
negative 3 is that negative
3, right there.

65
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm just saying, if we go from
that point to that point, our

66
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,640
y went down by 6, right?

67
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,960
We went from 6 to 0.

68
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,650
Our y went down by 6.

69
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,420
So we get 0 minus
6 is negative 6.

70
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,070
That makes sense.

71
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,150
Y went down by 6.

72
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,180
And, if we went from that point
to that point, what

73
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,060
happened to x?

74
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,560
We went from negative 3 to
6, it should go up by 9.

75
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,870
And if you calculate this, take
your 6 minus negative 3,

76
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,550
that's the same thing as
6 plus 3, that is 9.

77
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,120
And what is negative 6/9?

78
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,060
Well, if you simplify it,
it is negative 2/3.

79
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,950
You divide the numerator and
the denominator by 3.

80
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,860
So that is our slope,
negative 2/3.

81
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,800
So we're pretty much ready
to use point slope form.

82
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,760
We have a point, we could pick
one of these points, I'll just

83
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,149
go with the negative 3, 6.

84
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,269
And we have our slope.

85
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,910
So let's put it in
point slope form.

86
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:29,050
   

87
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,910
All we have to do is we say y
minus-- now we could have

88
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,030
taken either of these points,
I'll take this one-- so y

89
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:42,990
minus the y value over here, so
y minus 6 is equal to our

90
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:51,480
slope, which is negative
2/3 times x minus our

91
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,930
x-coordinate.

92
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,490
Well, our x-coordinate, so x
minus our x-coordinate is

93
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,370
negative 3, x minus negative
3, and we're done.

94
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,570
We can simplify it
a little bit.

95
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:08,650
This becomes y minus 6 is equal
to negative 2/3 times x.

96
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,610
x minus negative 3 is the
same thing as x plus 3.

97
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,760
This is our point slope form.

98
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,270
Now, we can literally just
algebraically manipulate this

99
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,500
guy right here to put it into
our slope intercept form.

100
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,130
Let's do that.

101
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,560
So let's do slope intercept
in orange.

102
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,960
So we have slope intercept.

103
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,200
   

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,040
So what can we do here
to simplify this?

105
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,510
Well, we can multiply out the
negative 2/3, so you get y

106
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,150
minus 6 is equal to-- I'm just
distributing the negative

107
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,950
2/3-- so negative 2/3 times
x is negative 2/3 x.

108
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,890
And then negative 2/3 times
3 is negative 2.

109
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,150
And now to get it in slope
intercept form, we just have

110
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,270
to add the 6 to both sides so
we get rid of it on the

111
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,380
left-hand side, so let's
add 6 to both

112
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,400
sides of this equation.

113
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,010
Left-hand side of the equation,
we're just left with

114
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,090
a y, these guys cancel out.

115
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,830
You get a y is equal
to negative 2/3 x.

116
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,810
Negative 2 plus 6 is plus 4.

117
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,890
So there you have it, that is
our slope intercept form, mx

118
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,590
plus b, that's our
y-intercept.

119
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,480
Now the last thing we need
to do is get it into

120
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,730
the standard form.

121
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,440
   

122
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,840
So once again, we just have to
algebraically manipulate it so

123
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,500
that the x's and the
y's are both on

124
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,130
this side of the equation.

125
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,140
So let's just add 2/3 x to both
sides of this equation.

126
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,140
So I'll start it here.

127
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,950
So we have y is equal to
negative 2/3 x plus 4, that's

128
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,540
slope intercept form.

129
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,790
Let's added 2/3 x, so
plus 2/3 x to both

130
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,040
sides of this equation.

131
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,650
   

132
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,060
I'm doing that so it I don't
have this 2/3 x on the

133
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,350
right-hand side, this
negative 2/3 x.

134
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,010
So the left-hand side of the
equation-- I scrunched it up a

135
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,730
little bit, maybe more than I
should have-- the left-hand

136
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,890
side of this equation is what?

137
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:16,390
It is 2/3 x, because 2 over
3x, plus this y, that's my

138
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,220
left-hand side, is equal to--
these guys cancel out-- is

139
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,650
equal to 4.

140
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,580
So this, by itself, we are in
standard form, this is the

141
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,790
standard form of the equation.

142
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,030
If we want it to look, make it
look extra clean and have no

143
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,340
fractions here, we could
multiply both sides of this

144
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,860
equation by 3.

145
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,400
If we do that, what do we get?

146
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,220
2/3 x times 3 is just 2x.

147
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,440
y times 3 is 3y.

148
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,700
And then 4 times 3 is 12.

149
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,620
These are the same equations,
I just multiplied

150
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,760
every term by 3.

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,190
If you do it to the left-hand
side, you can do to the

152
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,680
right-hand side-- or you have to
