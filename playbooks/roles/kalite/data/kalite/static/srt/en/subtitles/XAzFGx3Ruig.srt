1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,835
Someone walks up to you on the street and says two thousand, nine hundred and forty-three.

2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:07,490
Quick! Is this divisible by nine? It's a matter of life and death!

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,575
And you could say "well I can do this fairly quickly

4
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:13,993
to figure out whether this is divisible by nine, I just have to add up the digits

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:17,278
and figure out if the sum of the digits is multiple

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,081
of nine or whether it is divisible by nine."

7
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:26,549
Let's do that. Two plus nine plus four plus three.

8
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:35,157
Two plus nine is eleven. Eleven plus four is fifteen. Fifteen plus three is eighteen. And eighteen is definitely divisible by nine.

9
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:37,907
So this is going to be divisible by nine.

10
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:42,245
And if you're unsure whether eighteen is divisible by nine, you can apply the same rule again.

11
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:48,547
One plus eight is equal to nine. So that's definitely (repeated) by nine.

12
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:53,996
And so the person can go save their life or whoever's life they are trying to save with that information.

13
00:00:53,996 --> 00:01:01,161
But this might lead you thinking how nice and useful this is. Why did that work? Does this work for all numbers or for only nine?

14
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:07,879
I don't think this works for eight, or seven or eleven or seventeen. Why does this work for nine?

15
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:10,947
This actually also works for three but we'll think about that in a future video.

16
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:15,497
To realize that, we just have to rewrite two thousand, nine hundred and forty-three.

17
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:25,946
So the two in 2943 in the thousands place so we can literally rewrite it as 2 x 1000.

18
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:32,165
The nine is in the hundreds place so we can literally re-write it as 9 x 100.

19
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:41,159
The four is in the tens place so literally the same thing as 4 x 10. And now finally we have our three in the ones place.

20
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,497
We can write it as 3 x 1 or just three.

21
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:48,347
So this says two thousand, nine hundred, forty and three.

22
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:59,082
Now we can re-write each of these things as thousands, hundreds, tens as the sum of one plus something that is divisible by nine.

23
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:04,554
So, a thousand, I can re-write as one plus nine-hundred ninety nine.

24
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:10,917
I can re-write a hundred as one plus ninety-nine.

25
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:16,252
I can re-write ten as one plus nine.

26
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:22,082
And so two times a thousand is the same thing as two times one plus nine-hundred ninety nine.

27
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:26,223
Nine times a hundred is the same thing as nine times one plus ninety-nine.

28
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:31,021
Four times ten is the same thing as four times one plus nine.

29
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,751
And I have this plus three over here.

30
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:44,014
But now I can distribute, I can say that, well, this over here is the same as two times one which is two plus two times nine-hundred and ninety-nine.

31
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:53,547
This thing, right over here, is the same thing as nine times one. Just to be clear doing this, I'm distributing the two over the first parentheses, these first two terms.

32
00:02:53,547 --> 00:03:00,215
Then the nine, I'm going to distribute again. It's going to be nine times one plus nine times ninety-nine.

33
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:15,947
And then, over here I'm going to distribute the four. Four times one so plus four and then four times nine so plus four times nine.

34
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:20,480
And then finally, I have this positive three, this plus three right over here.

35
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,619
Now I'm just going to re-arrange this addition. So I'm just going to take all the terms

36
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:29,014
and multiplying by nine hundred ninety nine. And I'm going to do that in orange.

37
00:03:29,014 --> 00:03:34,818
So I'll do this term, this term and this term right over here.

38
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:43,416
And so I have two times nine hundred and ninety-nine plus that nine times ninety-nine plus four times nine.

39
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:59,280
So that are those three terms and then I have plus two plus nine plus four and plus three.

40
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,080
This is just the sum of our digits. This is what we did up here.

41
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,966
And you might see where all of this is going. This orange stuff here, is this divisible by nine?

42
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:14,903
Well it sure would definitely! Nine nine nine that's divisible by nine.

43
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:17,474
So anything this multiplying this by divisible of nine.

44
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:21,160
This is divisible by nine. This is definitely divisible by nine.

45
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,592
Ninety nine. Regardless of whatever is being multiplying by nine.

46
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:29,640
Whatever is multiplying by nine. Whatever is multiplying by ninety nine is divisible by nine.

47
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,453
Because ninety nine is divisible by nine.

48
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:33,746
So this works out. And same thing over here.

49
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:38,226
You are always going to be multiplying by a multiple of nine.

50
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:43,965
So all of this business right over here is definitely going to be divisible by nine.

51
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:50,084
and so all for whole thing, and I all did was rewrote 2943 like this right over here.

52
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:55,069
In order for whole thing to be divisible by nine. This part definitely is divisible by nine.

53
00:04:55,069 --> 00:05:00,139
In order for the whole thing does the rest of the sum and it has to be divisible by nine as well.

54
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:08,449
So in order this whole thing, all of this has to be divisible by nine.
