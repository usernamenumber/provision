1
00:00:01,045 --> 00:00:09,125
we are asked to simplify nine p to the two thirds all of that over the square root of the four p cube

2
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:15,720
so lets just do this step by step the first thing we can do is well if its nine p of the two third thats

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:27,376
the same thing as nine to the two third times p to the two third that's what the stop part that we can

4
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:33,267
simplify too now the bottom part we can rewrite the bottom part right here the square root of four p

5
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:41,308
to the third this is the exact same thing as four p to the third to the one half part power this is the

6
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:51,525
exact same thing as four p to the third to the one half power this is the same thing square root of four

7
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:52,129
p to the third is same thing as four p to the third to the one half power so given that we can do the

8
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:55,380
same thing we did on the numerator we can say well this is the same thing as four to the one half

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:06,711
four to the the one half times p to the third to the one half power now lets see that we can simplify

10
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:12,516
this even more so this is going to be equal to lets do the denominator first here so whats four to the

11
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:18,553
one half power what's the principle rule of four well two squared is four so its two its positive root

12
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:23,522
is two and then p to the third and that to the one half that's the same thing p to the three times one

13
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:39,133
half or p to the three half p to the three over two nine to the two thirds so the cube root of nine is

14
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,055
anything easy well actually yo can think by this way yo could say its nine squared so we can do nine

15
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:48,553
to the two thirds le me do this this way this is the best to think about it this nine to the two thirds

16
00:01:48,553 --> 00:01:58,631
one could write it some kind of making it unsimplifying it but it will help calculate it what it actually

17
00:01:58,631 --> 00:01:59,699
means nine to the two third is the same thing as nine squared to the one third power right because two

18
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:05,179
times one third is two thirds and you have that off course times p to the two third and this is going

19
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:07,872
to be eqal to nine squared is eighty one so its eighty one to the one third power times p to the two

20
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:23,383
thirds now instead of writing this two and this p to the three half down here let me just write it as

21
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:27,841
negative exponents so you are going to just write it like this the two in the denominater is the same

22
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:34,389
thing as two to the negative one or one half so this right here somewhere in the numerator is the same

23
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:38,708
thing as one half that and that is the the same thing and p to the three half in the denominator is the

24
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:49,436
same thing as p as p to the negative p to the negative three half so this whole expressions so far simplified

25
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:58,445
to this right over here let me copy and past to the next line now so let me copy it and paste bring it

26
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:06,433
down right over there let's see if can simplify this even more so let's think about eighty one if we

27
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:14,003
can write it as well essentially we take something to the cube we take the cube root or something we

28
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:17,393
are taking some we are taking some thing one third power taking the cube root of it so we have to find

29
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:20,551
some numbers or may be we can factor it into things that do have cube root and other things they don't

30
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:29,333
so eighty one is divisible by three its three times twenty seven which is three times nine which is three

31
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:36,667
times three so eighty one is three to the fourth power or its three multiplied by itself three times

32
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:44,189
so we could rewrite this eighty one to the one third we could rewrite as three times three times three

33
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:51,805
to the well alright like this times three to the one third that's the same thing as eighty one and let's

34
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:57,378
think about this ps and i am doing more steps that if want to on piece of paper so i really want you

35
00:03:57,378 --> 00:04:03,554
to understand kind of what's going on here so p to the two thirds times p to the negative three half

36
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:13,400
so that's going to be times p to the two thirds two thirds minus three half power so we did the ps then

37
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:21,526
we just had the times one half times one half now this right over here this is the same thing this is

38
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:29,050
the same thing as we could just use this as three times three times three so its the same thing as three

39
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:35,458
times three times three to the one third times three to the one third right we done this multiple time

40
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:43,864
times the two third minus three half so lets just work that out actually three half is the larger so

41
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:50,600
lets just say its negative of the three half minus two thirds which is equal to the negative if we use

42
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:58,446
six as a common denominator if we use six as a common denominator three half well six is the denominator

43
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:04,298
as nine six minus four over six that's what two third is equal to so nine minus four is five six let

44
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:17,858
me have this negative value so equals negative five six so times p to the negative five six power times

45
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:24,200
one half times that last one half here now three time three times three are twenty seven to the one third

46
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,979
the cube root of twenty seven is three so this right here simplifies to three and then three to the one

47
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:32,858
third that's cube root of three so we can say three and then this right here is the cube root of three

48
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:46,186
the cube root of three so we get three times the cube of three time p to the negative five six to some

49
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:53,467
time you wanna right p out here infront of the radical that's actually to be separate so iwill right

50
00:05:53,467 --> 00:06:01,186
the p to the negative five six p to the negative five six

51
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,044
then i will right the radical so times the cube root of three and all that times one half so we can all

52
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:06,202
of that time one half or you can just divide it by two and we have simplified it about as far as you

53
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:07,642
can do as three half you can say three half is one point five p to the negative five six time the cube

54
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:10,800
root of three if you wanted to you can calculate it cube root of three multiply that times one half you
