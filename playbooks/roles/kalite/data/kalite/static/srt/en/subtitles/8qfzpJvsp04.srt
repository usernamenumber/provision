1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,420
Throughout our journey through
chemistry so far, we've

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,810
touched on the interactions
between molecules, metal

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,290
molecules, how they attract each
other because of the sea

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,665
of electrons and water
molecules.

6
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:16,545
But I think it's good to have a
general discussion about all

7
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:19,100
of the different types of
molecular interactions and

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,860
what it means for the boiling
points or the melting points

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,890
of a substance.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,870
So I'll start with the weakest.
Let's say I had a

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,120
bunch of helium.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,100
Helium, you know, I'll just draw
it as helium atoms. We'll

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,150
look in the Periodic Table, and
what I'm going to do now

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,360
with helium I could do with
any of the noble gases.

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,860
Because the point is that
noble gases are happy.

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,275
Their outer orbital is filled.

17
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:41,590
Let's say, neon or helium--
let me do neon, actually,

18
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,210
because neon has a full eight
in its orbital so we could

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,750
write neon like neon and
it's completely happy.

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,600
It's completely satisfied
with itself.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,950
And so in a world where it's
completely satisfied, there's

22
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,630
no obvious reason just yet-- I'm
going to touch on a reason

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,850
why it should be-- if these
electrons are evenly

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,920
distributed around these
atoms, then these are

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,040
completely neutral atoms. They
don't want to bond with each

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,080
other or do anything else, so
they should just float around

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,310
and there's no reason for them
to be attracted to each other

28
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,100
or not attracted
to each other.

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,370
But it turns out that neon does
have a liquid state, if

30
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,230
you get cold enough, and so the
fact that it has a liquid

31
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,820
state means that there must be
some force that's making the

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,060
neon atoms attracted to each
other, some force out there.

33
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,260
Because it's in a very cold
state, because for the most

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,430
part, there is not a lot of
force that attracts them so

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,210
it'll be a gas at most
temperatures.

36
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,570
But if you get really cold, you
can get a very weak force

37
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,130
that starts to connect or makes
the neon molecules want

38
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,240
to get towards each other.

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,160
And that force comes out of
the reality that we talked

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,950
about early on that electrons
are not in a fixed, uniform

41
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,990
orbit around things.

42
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,240
They're probablistic.

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,420
And if we imagine, let me say
neon now, instead of drawing

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,090
these nice and neat valence
dot electrons like that,

45
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,760
instead, I can kind of draw
its electrons as-- it's a

46
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,060
probability cloud and it's
what neon's atomic

47
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,420
configuration is.

48
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,630
1s2 and it's outer orbital
is 2s2 2p6, right?

49
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,547
So it's highest energy electron,
so, you know, it'll

50
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:21,580
look-- I don't know.

51
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,560
It has the 2s shell.

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,110
The 1s shell is inside of that
and it has the p-orbitals.

53
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,160
The p-orbitals look like that
in different dimensions.

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,130
That's not the point.

55
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,680
And then you have another neon
atom and these are-- and I'm

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,550
just drawing the probability
distribution.

57
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,350
I'm not trying to
draw a rabbit.

58
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,250
But I think you get the point.

59
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,620
Watch the electron configuration
videos if you

60
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,440
want more on this, but the idea
behind these probability

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,390
distributions is that the
electrons could be anywhere.

62
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,960
There could be a moment in time
when all the electrons

63
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,940
are out over here.

64
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,330
There could be a moment in time
where all the electrons

65
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:57,810
are over here.

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,510
Same thing for this neon atom.

67
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,590
If you think about it, out
of all of the possible

68
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,690
configurations, let's say we
have these two neon atoms,

69
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,290
there's actually a very low
likelihood that they're going

70
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,065
to be completely evenly
distributed.

71
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,760
   

72
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,770
There's many more scenarios
where the electron

73
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,560
distribution is a little
uneven in one

74
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,530
neon atom or another.

75
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,080
So if in this neon atom,
temporarily its eight valence

76
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,230
electrons just happen to be
like, you know, one, two,

77
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,710
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, then what does this

78
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,540
neon atom look like?

79
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,240
It temporarily has a
slight charge in

80
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,120
this direction, right?

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,770
It'll feel like this side is
more negative than this side

82
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,170
or this side is more positive
than that side.

83
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:45,000
Similarly, if at that very same
moment I had another neon

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,710
that had one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

85
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,940
that had a similar-- actually,
let me do that differently.

86
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,650
Let's say that this neon atom is
like this: one, two, three,

87
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,930
four, five, six, seven, eight.

88
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,620
So here, and I'll do it in a
dark color because it's a very

89
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,330
faint force.

90
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,500
So this would be a
little negative.

91
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,055
Temporarly, just for that single
moment in time, this

92
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:11,130
will be kind of negative.

93
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,400
That'll be positive.

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,530
This side will be negative.

95
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,019
This side will be positive.

96
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,399
So you're going to have a little
bit of an attraction

97
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,910
for that very small moment of
time between this neon and

98
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,340
this neon, and then it'll
disappear, because the

99
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,160
electrons will reconfigure.

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,150
But the important thing to
realize is that almost at no

101
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,580
point is neon's electrons
going to be completely

102
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,140
distributed.

103
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,460
So as long as there's always
going to be this haphazard

104
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,760
distribution, there's always
going to be a little bit of

105
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,910
a-- I don't want to say polar
behavior, because that's

106
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,285
almost too strong of a word.

107
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:45,360
But there will always be a
little bit of an extra charge

108
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,850
on one side or the other side
of an atom, which will allow

109
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,750
it to attract it to the opposite
side charges of other

110
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,040
similarly imbalanced
molecules.

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,510
And this is a very, very,
very weak force.

112
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,040
It's called the London
dispersion force.

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,500
I think the guy who came up with
this, Fritz London, who

114
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,120
was neither-- well, he
was not British.

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,470
I think he was German-American.

116
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:12,925
London dispersion force, and
it's the weakest of the van

117
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,175
der Waals forces.

118
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:18,980
   

119
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,810
I'm sure I'm not pronouncing
it correctly.

120
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,890
And the van der Waals forces
are the class of all of the

121
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,490
intermolecular, and in
this case, neon-- the

122
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,670
molecule, is an atom .

123
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,040
It's just a one-atom molecule,
I guess you could say.

124
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,760
The van der Waals forces are
the class of all of the

125
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,010
intermolecular forces that are
not covalent bonds and that

126
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,647
aren't ionic bonds like we have
in salts, and we'll touch

127
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:39,230
on those in a second.

128
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,260
And the weakest of them are the
London dispersion forces.

129
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,290
So neon, these noble gases,
actually, all of these noble

130
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,800
gases right here, the only thing
that they experience are

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,940
London dispersion forces, which
are the weakest of all

132
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,920
of the intermolecular forces.

133
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,190
And because of that, it takes
very little energy to get them

134
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,460
into a gaseous state.

135
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,520
So at a very, very low
temperature, the noble gases

136
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,140
will turn into the
gaseous state.

137
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,670
That's why they're called noble
gases, first of all.

138
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,920
And they're the most likely
to behave like ideal gases

139
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,820
because they have
very, very small

140
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,550
attraction to each other.

141
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,500
Fair enough.

142
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,880
Now, what happens when we go
to situations when we go to

143
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,230
molecules that have better
attractions or that are a

144
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,290
little bit more polar?

145
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,670
Let's say I had hydrogen
chloride, right?

146
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,480
Hydrogen, it's a little bit
ambivalent about whether or

147
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,660
not it keeps its electrons.

148
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,180
Chloride wants to keep
the electrons.

149
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,250
Chloride's quite
electronegative.

150
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,590
It's less electronegative than
these guys right here.

151
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,710
These are kind of the
super-duper electron hogs,

152
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,340
nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine,
but chlorine is

153
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,650
pretty electronegative.

154
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,940
So if I have hydrogen chloride,
so I have the

155
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:57,200
chlorine atom right here, it has
seven electrons and then

156
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,210
it shares an electron
with the hydrogen.

157
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,076
It shares an electron with
the hydrogen, and I'll

158
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:03,410
just do it like that.

159
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,710
Because this is a good bit
more electronegative than

160
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,320
hydrogen, the electrons spend
a lot of time out here.

161
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,950
So what you end up having is a
partial negative charge on the

162
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,740
side, where the electron
hog is, and a

163
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,270
partial positive side.

164
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,860
And this is actually
very analogous to

165
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,870
the hydrogen bonds.

166
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,710
Hydrogen bonds are actually a
class of this type of bond,

167
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,945
which is called a dipole bond,
or dipole-dipole interaction.

168
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,670
So if I have one chlorine atom
like that and if I have

169
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,700
another chlorine atom,
the other chlorine

170
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,732
atoms looks like this.

171
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:37,480
If I have the other chlorine
atom-- let me copy and paste

172
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,650
it-- right there, then
you'll have this

173
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,320
attraction between them.

174
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,440
You'll have this attraction
between these two chlorine

175
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,490
atoms-- oh, sorry,
between these two

176
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,930
hydrogen chloride molecules.

177
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,120
And the positive side, the
positive pole of this dipole

178
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,410
is the hydrogen side, because
the electrons have kind of

179
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,600
left it, will be attracted
to the chlorine side

180
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,030
of the other molecules.

181
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,590
And because this van der Waals
force, this dipole-dipole

182
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,790
interaction is stronger than
a London dispersion force.

183
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,540
And just to be clear, London
dispersion forces occur in all

184
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,960
molecular interactions.

185
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,630
It's just that it's very weak
when you compare it to pretty

186
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,570
much anything else.

187
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,810
It only becomes relevant when
you talk about things with

188
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,810
noble gases.

189
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,960
Even here, they're also London
dispersion forces when the

190
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
electron distribution just
happens to go one way or the

191
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,390
other for a single
instant of time.

192
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,190
But this dipole-dipole
interaction is much stronger.

193
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,130
And because it's much stronger,
hydrogen chloride is

194
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,700
going to take more energy to,
one, get into the liquid

195
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,450
state, or even more, get into
the gaseous state than, say,

196
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,530
just a sample of helium gas.

197
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,700
Now, when you get even more
electronegative, when this

198
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,220
guy's even more electronegative
when you're

199
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,920
dealing with nitrogen, oxygen
or fluorine, you get into a

200
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,720
special case of dipole-dipole
interactions, and that's the

201
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,590
hydrogen bond.

202
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:06,480
So it's really the same thing if
you have hydrogen fluoride,

203
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,140
a bunch of hydrogen fluorides
around the place.

204
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,180
Maybe I could write fluoride,
and I'll write hydrogen

205
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,100
fluoride here.

206
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,030
Fluoride its
ultra-electronegative.

207
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,220
It's one of the three most
electronegative atoms on the

208
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,950
Periodic Table, and
so it pretty much

209
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,290
hogs all of the electrons.

210
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,080
So this is a super-strong case
of the dipole-dipole

211
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,920
interaction, where here, all of
the electrons are going to

212
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,110
be hogged around the
fluorine side.

213
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,180
So you're going to have a
partial positive charge,

214
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,270
partial negative side, partial
positive, partial negative,

215
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,105
partial positive, partial
negative and so on.

216
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:52,830
So you're going to have this,
which is really a dipole

217
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,430
interaction.

218
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,990
But it's a very strong dipole
interaction, so people call it

219
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,470
a hydrogen bond because it's
dealing with hydrogen and a

220
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,640
very electronegative atom, where
the electronegative atom

221
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,690
is pretty much hogging all of
hydrogen's one electron.

222
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,720
So hydrogen is sitting out here
with just a proton, so

223
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,560
it's going to be pretty
positive, and it's really

224
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,660
attracted to the negative
side of these molecules.

225
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,530
But hydrogen, all of these
are van der Waals.

226
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,700
So van der Waals, the weakest
is London dispersion.

227
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,610
Then if you have a molecule with
a more electronegative

228
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,900
atom, then you start having a
dipole, where you have one

229
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,330
side where molecule becomes
polar and you have the

230
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,290
interaction between the positive
and the negative side

231
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,670
of the pole.

232
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,020
It gets a dipole-dipole
interaction.

233
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,390
And then an even stronger type
of bond is a hydrogen bond

234
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,780
because the
super-electronegative atom is

235
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,670
essentially stripping off the
electron of the hydrogen, or

236
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,060
almost stripping it off.

237
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,250
It's still shared,
but it's all on

238
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,420
that side of the molecule.

239
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,940
Since this is even a stronger
bond between molecules, it

240
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,660
will have even a higher
boiling point.

241
00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:01,380
So London dispersion, and you
have dipole or polar bonds,

242
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,370
and then you have
hydrogen bonds.

243
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,310
All of these are van der
Waals, but because the

244
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,360
strength of the intermolecular
bond gets stronger, boiling

245
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,300
point goes up because it takes
more and more energy to

246
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,390
separate these from
each other.

247
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,190
In the next video-- I realize
I'm out of time.

248
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,040
So this is a good survey, I
think, of just the different

249
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,370
types of intermolecular
interactions that aren't

250
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,950
necessarily covalent or ionic.

251
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,360
In the next video, I'll talk
about some of the covalent and

252
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,900
ionic types of structures that
can be formed and how that

253
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,900
might affect the different
boiling points.
