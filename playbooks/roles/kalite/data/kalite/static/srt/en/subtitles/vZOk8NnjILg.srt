1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,440
Let's say we observe some object--

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,970
let's say for the sake of argument, it's happening in space

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,870
It's traveling in a circular path with

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,100
the magnitude of its velocity being constant

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,050
Let me draw its velocity vector

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,510
The length of this arrow is the magnitude of the velocity

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,700
I want to be clear. In order for it to be traveling in the circular path

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,220
the direction of its velocity needs to be changing

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,590
So this time the velocity vector might look like that

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:36,880
After a few seconds the velocity vector might look like this

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,210
After another few seconds the velocity vector might look like this

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,450
I'm just sampling. I actually could've sampled after a less time and it would be right over there

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,780
but I am just sampling sometimes as it travels around the circle

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,330
After a few more seconds the velocity vector might look something like that

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,120
I want to think about what needs to happen

16
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,310
what kind of force would have to act

17
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,850
in particular the direction of the force would have to act on this object

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
in order for the velocity vector to change like that?

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,510
This remind ourselves if there was no force acting on this body

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,680
this comes straight from Newton's 1st Law of motion

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,900
then the velocity would not change

22
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,450
neither the magnitude nor the direction of the velocity will change

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,640
If there were no force acting on the subject

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,940
it would just continue going on in the direction it was going

25
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,230
it wouldn't curve; it wouldn't turn; the direction of its velocity wasn't changing

26
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,620
Let's think about what the direction of that force would have to be

27
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,200
and to do that, I'm gonna copy and paste these velocity vectors and keep

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,860
track of what the direction of the change in velocity has to be

29
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,990
Copy and paste that

30
00:01:52,350 --> 00:02:00,210
So that is our first velocity vector

31
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,920
Copy all of these. This is our second one right over here

32
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,810
Copy and paste it

33
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,210
I'm just looking at it from the object's point of view

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,760
how does the velocity vector change from each of these points in time to the next?

35
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,860
Let me get all of these in there

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,430
This green one

37
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,910
That. Copy and paste it

38
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,890
That. I could keep going, keep drawing velocity vectors around the circle

39
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,530
but let me do this orange one right over here

40
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,050
Copy and paste

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:57,030
So between this magenta time and this purple time

42
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,160
what was the change in velocity?

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,950
Well, we could look at that purely from these vectors right here

44
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,110
The change in velocity between those two times was that right over there

45
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,110
That is our change in velocity

46
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:15,900
So I take this vector and say in what direction was the velocity changing

47
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,440
when this vector was going on this part of the arc

48
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,640
It's roughly--if I just translate that vector right over here

49
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,850
it's roughly going in that direction

50
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,010
So that is the direction of our change in velocity

51
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,160
This triangle is delta; delta is for change

52
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,970
Now think about the next time period

53
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,020
between this blue or purple period and this green period

54
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,750
Our change in velocity would look like that

55
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,260
So while it's traveling along this part of the arc

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,180
roughly it's the change in velocity if we draw the vector starting at the object

57
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,710
It would look something like this

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,050
I'm just translating this vector right over here

59
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,310
I'll do it one more time

60
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,500
From this green point in time to this orange point in time

61
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,520
and obviously we're just sampling points continuously moving

62
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,980
and the change in velocity actually continues changing

63
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,770
but hopefully you're going to see the pattern here

64
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:21,340
So between those two points in time, this is our change in velocity

65
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,730
And let me translate that vector right over there

66
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,860
It would look something like that

67
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,590
change in velocity

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,330
So what do you see, if I were to keep drawing more of these change in velocity vectors

69
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,330
you would see at this point, the change in velocity would have to be going

70
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,590
generally in that direction

71
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,920
At this point, the change in velocity would have to be going generally in that direction

72
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,490
So what do you see? What's the pattern for any point along this circular curve?

73
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,970
Well, the change in velocity

74
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,340
first of all, is perpendicular to the direction of the velocity itself

75
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,040
And we haven't proved it, but it at least looks like it

76
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,080
Looks like this is perpendicular

77
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,870
And even more interesting, it looks like it's seeking the center

78
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:10,410
The change in velocity is constantly going in the direction of the center of our circle

79
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,560
And we know from Newton's first law

80
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,620
that if--the magnitude could stay the same but the

81
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,710
velocity change in any way, either the magnitude or the direction or both

82
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,430
there must be a net force acting on the object

83
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,790
And the net force is acting in the direction of the acceleration

84
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,770
which is causing the change in velocity

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,450
So the force must be acting in the same direction as this change in velocity

86
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,950
So in order make this object go in this circular

87
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,710
there must be some force kind of pulling the object towards the center

88
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,530
and a force that is perpendicular to its directional motion

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,300
And this force is called the centripetal force

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,850
Centripetal

91
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,490
Not to be confused with centrifugal force, very different

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,400
Centripetal force, centri- you might recognize as center

93
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:13,910
and then -petal is seeking the center. It is center seeking

94
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,650
So this centripetal force, something is pulling on this object towards the center that

95
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,340
causes it to go into this circular motion

96
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,350
Inward pulling causes inward acceleration

97
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,730
So that's centripetal force

98
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,190
causing centripetal acceleration

99
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,130
which causes the object to go towards the center

100
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,580
The whole point why I did this is that at least it wasn't intuitive to me

101
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,760
that if you have this object going in a circle

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,220
that the change in velocity, the acceleration, the force acting on this object

103
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,550
would actually have to be towards the center

104
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,780
The whole reason why I drew these vectors

105
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,220
and then translate them over here and drew these change in velocity vectors

106
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:04,830
is to show you that the change in velocity is actually towards the center of this circle

107
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,600
Now with that out of the way, you might say, well, where is this happening in in everyday life

108
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,240
or in reality in some way it perform

109
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,880
And the most typical example of this and this is something that I think most of us have done

110
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,900
when we were kid if you had a yoyo

111
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,550
My best attempt to draw a yoyo

112
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,680
If you have a yoyo and if you whip it around on a string

113
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:36,330
you know that the yoyo goes in a circle

114
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:42,080
Even though its speed might be constant, or the magnitude of its velocity might be constant

115
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,090
we know that the direction of its velocity is constantly changing

116
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,830
It's going in a circle and what's causing it to go in a circle is your hand right over here

117
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,200
pulling on this string and providing tension into the string

118
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,330
So there's a force, the centripetal force in this yoyo example is the tension in the string

119
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,180
that's constantly pulling on the yoyo towards the center

120
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,720
and that's why that yoyo goes in a circle

121
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,090
Another example that you are probably somewhat familiar with or at least have heard about

122
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,380
is if you have something in orbit around the planet

123
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,630
So let's say this is Earth right here

124
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:27,620
and you have some type of a satellite that is in orbit around Earth

125
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:33,140
That satellite has some velocity at any given moment in time

126
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,740
What's keeping it from not flying out into space and keeping it going in a circle

127
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,590
is the force of gravity

128
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,750
So in the example of a satellite or anything in the orbit

129
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,190
even the moon in orbit around the Earth

130
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,830
the thing that's keeping an orbit as opposed to flying out into space

131
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,430
is a centripetal force of Earth's gravity

132
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,010
Now another example, this is probably the most everyday example because we do it all the time

133
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,860
If you imagine a car traveling around the racetrack

134
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,860
Let's draw a racetrack. If I have a racetrack

135
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,250
Before I tell you the answer, I'll have you think about it

136
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,190
It's circular. Let's view the racetrack from above

137
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,470
If I have a car on a racetrack. I want you to pause it before I tell it to you

138
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,700
because I think it's an interesting thing think about

139
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,910
It seems like a very obvious thing that's happening

140
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,040
We've all experienced; we've all taken turns in cars

141
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,810
So we're looking at the top of a car. Tires

142
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,650
When you see a car going at a constant speed

143
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,560
so on the speedometer, it might say, 60 mph, 40 mph, whatever the constant speed

144
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,530
but it's traveling in a circle

145
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,840
so what is keeping--what is the centripetal force in that example?

146
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,340
There's no obvious string being pulled on the car towards the center

147
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,660
There is no some magical gravity pulling it towards the center of the circle

148
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,170
There's obviously gravity pulling you down towards the ground

149
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,280
but nothing pulling it to the side like this

150
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,180
So what's causing this car to go in the circle as opposed to going straight?

151
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,390
And I encourage you to pause it right now before I tell you the answer

152
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,520
Assuming you now unpaused it and I will now tell you the answer

153
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,370
The thing that's keeping it going in the circle is actually the force of friction

154
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:26,750
It's actually the force between the resist movement to the side between the tires and the road

155
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,270
And a good example of that is if you would remove the friction

156
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,770
if you would make the car driving on oil or on ice

157
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,070
or if you would shave the treads of the tire or something

158
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,990
then the car would not be able to do this

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,240
So it's actually the force of friction in this example

160
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,560
I encourage you to think about that
