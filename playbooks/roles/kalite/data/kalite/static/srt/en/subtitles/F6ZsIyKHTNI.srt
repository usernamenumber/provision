2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,664
So to recap from the last video,

3
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:12,106
Luther refused to renounce his teachings at the Diet of Worms

4
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:17,400
and was kidnapped as he left the Diet of Worms by the Elector of Saxony,

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,350
and secreted away in a castle,

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,601
where he translated the New Testament into German.

7
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:26,522
This is an enormous undertaking, which he
completes in a matter of months;

8
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:28,643
and it's important to Luther because it means

9
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:31,438
that everyone can read the Bible for themselves.

10
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:36,685
Luther's main ideas are Scripture Alone and the Priesthood of All Believers.

11
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:40,041
So you don't need to go to the Church to understand the Word of God,

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,170
to understand the path to salvation;

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,518
all you need to do is to read the Bible - Scripture Alone.

14
00:00:45,518 --> 00:00:48,381
So, putting the Bible in the hands of everyone.

15
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,385
This other idea - the Priesthood of All Believers -

16
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:55,862
is this notion that we can have a direct relationship with God

17
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:58,356
that's unmediated by the priest,

18
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:00,742
by local bishop, or by the Pope;

19
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:02,871
it's just us and our Creator.

20
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:06,383
So we've come across three major ideas, then, from Luther:

21
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:11,024
Faith Alone, Scripture Alone, and the Priesthood of All Believers.

22
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:15,093
Now, these ideas - that we can look directly at the Scriptures,

23
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:18,229
that we can have that kind of direct relationship
with God -

24
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:22,934
means that lots of people can come up with slightly varying understandings

25
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:24,604
of what that relationship is.

26
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:28,878
Right. As soon as the Word of God is not mediated by the Church,

27
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:31,422
as soon as everyone can read it for themselves,

28
00:01:31,422 --> 00:01:33,426
it becomes clear just how ambiguous

29
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,581
much of what's in the New Testament and the Old Testament really is,

30
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:39,824
and how differently it can be interpreted by different people.

31
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:43,208
And that's why we have so many different
Protestant sects.

32
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:47,402
Immediately, Luther's words spread very quickly.

33
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:51,355
If we go to Zurich, to Switzerland, we find Zwingli.

34
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:55,017
Like Luther, he looks to Scripture as the sole authority -

35
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:56,980
not the Church, but Scripture.

36
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,691
Now, he differed from Luther in one important regard: the Eucharist.

37
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:02,274
Now, Luther had already broken with

38
00:02:02,274 --> 00:02:04,524
the Catholic Church's understanding of the Eucharist,

39
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,029
that there was transubstantiation: that is,

40
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:11,357
that the bread and the wine was, by miracle,

41
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:15,521
transformed into the actual flesh and the actual blood of Christ.

42
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:19,068
Luther believed that the blood of Christ and the flesh of Christ

43
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:20,739
was present in the bread and the wine,

44
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,690
but not that the priest had this kind of special power

45
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,856
that allowed for the transformation itself.

46
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:29,087
And then Zwingli changes that interpretation,

47
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:32,188
and says that the Eucharist is entirely symbolic,

48
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:36,910
and that there is no actual blood and no actual flesh present in the church.

49
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,913
Right. And actually,

50
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:41,789
Luther and Zwingli got together to debate this issue,

51
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:44,730
to try to create a more unified Protestant church,

52
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,166
but they were unable to agree.

53
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,357
So you can see these very serious doctrinal disputes

54
00:02:49,357 --> 00:02:52,828
that are going on during this time. Everything is being questioned.

55
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:54,715
Well, in Zurich at the same time,

56
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:57,477
also we have another group, the Anabaptists.

57
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:02,233
And they're fascinating, because they take issue with the practice of baptism

58
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:06,087
close to birth: that is, an infant is brought and baptized.

59
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:09,645
They look back to the belief that Christ was baptized as an adult:

60
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:12,089
that is, he was baptized of his own free will;

61
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:14,981
and they were called the Anabaptists by people who didn't like them,

62
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:18,195
because they sought this kind of spiritual
awakening later in life,

63
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:21,026
when we could take responsibility for our spiritual
lives.

64
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:24,231
Right, and "Anabaptist" actually means "re-baptism,"

65
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:27,616
which was completely against Catholic Church doctrine.

66
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,582
And the Amish and the Mennonites actually come directly from the Anabaptists.

67
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:33,163
And those may be more familiar to us.

68
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:37,704
John Calvin, another really important reformer during this period,

69
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:41,304
who we might know for his doctrine of predestination.

70
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,497
This is really following very much what Luther also taught,

71
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:47,689
that all you needed to have was faith.

72
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:51,779
God had already decided, for Calvin, from the beginning of time

73
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:55,023
who was elect: in other words, who was blessed,

74
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:57,124
who would go to Heaven, and who would go to Hell.

75
00:03:57,124 --> 00:04:00,755
In other words, completely disregarding the possibility

76
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:02,234
of free will, of choice.

77
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:05,819
It's interesting, because we generally think that we have some agency,

78
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,514
that we can make our way into Heaven if only we are really truly good.

79
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:13,441
But Calvin and Luther are both saying,

80
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:17,039
"No, this is entirely God's will; and we only enact it."

81
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:19,220
God exists in the eternal realm,

82
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,026
and so it's not like God woke up on Monday and said,

83
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:24,698
"You're damned; and you over there, you're going to Hell,"

84
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,312
but something that's predetermined.

85
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:30,693
Now, Calvin was French. He was a lawyer originally, but he fled to Switzerland.

86
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:33,192
But let's go to England. What's happening there?

87
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:38,085
Well, Henry the Eighth wants an annulment from his first wife,

88
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:42,349
Catherine of Aragon, because she's failed to produce any male heirs to the throne.

89
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,473
Well, she had produced - or I should say, they had produced - male heirs,

90
00:04:45,473 --> 00:04:47,120
they just hadn't survived infancy.

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,235
And so, Henry the Eighth applies to the Pope for an annulment.

92
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:55,447
And the pope is actually worried about
offending the Holy Roman Emperor,

93
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:58,030
and there's all sorts of political issues, but he says

94
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,540
"Sorry, I can't grant you an annulment."

95
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,077
So Henry then goes to the head of the Church in England and says,

96
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:07,356
"Will you grant me an annulment?" and that is granted.

97
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:11,700
And so, the power of the Pope is usurped in this case.

98
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,770
And soon after that, an Act of Parliament makes the king -

99
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,867
the monarch of England - the head of the Church in England.

100
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:21,135
But I think we need to be careful, because

101
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:23,740
we don't want to say that the Anglican Church - that is,

102
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,523
the Church of England that Henry is now heading -

103
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:31,004
is entirely the result of his desire for divorce, or an annulment.

104
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:34,707
There are strong spiritual and also political issues here.

105
00:05:34,707 --> 00:05:36,385
Just like in the Germanic countries,

106
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:39,610
many felt that the pope had too much power.

107
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,245
And Henry was not only getting his annulment,

108
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:44,274
he was also getting the lands of the Church.

109
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:49,498
Protestantism is spreading in primarily German-speaking countries,

110
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:53,999
up in Scandinavia and England and Scotland, in Switzerland;

111
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:57,015
but if we look to Southern Germany and Italy,

112
00:05:57,015 --> 00:06:02,640
or France or Spain, those countries remain predominantly Catholic.

113
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,402
All true. But focusing too much on the politics,

114
00:06:05,402 --> 00:06:08,773
and focusing too much on Henry's marriages - because, you know,

115
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:10,597
ultimately Henry the Eighth will have six marriages -

116
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:14,795
is to miss the brutality, the violence of this period.

117
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:17,693
On both sides, Catholics and Protestants.

118
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:20,811
Thousands of people were hanged, burned at the stake,

119
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:24,196
tortured, simply because of their beliefs.

120
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:26,987
And each side was convinced that they were in the right,

121
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,777
and the other side was not only in the wrong,

122
00:06:29,777 --> 00:06:32,190
but actually somehow in the power of the Devil.

123
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,616
This was one of the most violent periods in Europe,

124
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:37,414
and some of the worst violence took place in France.

125
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:40,541
Now, the French Protestants were known as Huguenots.

126
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,974
And initially there was some tolerance, but that ended fairly quickly,

127
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:47,768
and the Huguenots were declared, en masse, heretical.

128
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:50,511
That is, Protestantism was outlawed in France.

129
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,751
And there was a civil war in France

130
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:55,431
for much of the end of the sixteenth century.

131
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:58,517
But just like in the German countries, and just like in England,

132
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:01,688
the issues were not only spiritual, they were also political.

133
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:05,246
And so, what you had is an alignment of the ruling families of France

134
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:08,703
pitted against each other on both the Protestant and the Catholic sides.

135
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:11,862
We also see attempts at tolerance.

136
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:14,067
So for example, in the German States,

137
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:19,023
the Peace of Augsburg in 1555 establishes this principle of

138
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:21,243
"Whose Realm, His Religion,"

139
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:24,612
this idea that the local princes in the Holy Roman Empire

140
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:27,453
could choose the religion for their area.

141
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:30,245
In other words, they could choose between Protestantism and Catholicism.

142
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:33,353
It's not going to be declared by the Holy Roman Emperor;

143
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,533
the ruler of each region is going to get to decide.

144
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:40,870
And similarly in France, we have the Edict of Nantes in 1598,

145
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,404
which establishes a principle of religious toleration.

146
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:46,428
So that really ends this long period

147
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:48,896
in the second half of the sixteenth century

148
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:53,788
known as the French Wars of Religion, and finally there is some peace.

149
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:56,452
But ultimately, things just got worse.

150
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,080
By the early seventeenth century,

151
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,769
we see the beginning of the Thirty Years War,

152
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,882
which pitted Protestants and Catholics against each other,

153
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,621
especially in the Holy Roman Empire.

154
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:15,163
