1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,059
In the last video we thought about how we would allocate our five dollars between chocolate bars and fruit.

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,578
And the way we did it was very rational: we thought about how much bang we would get for each buck.

3
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:14,503
And we saw starting off with our first dollar we got a lot of bang for our buck.

4
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:20,007
And this is just another way of saying bang for the buck: marginal utility per price.

5
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:24,905
So we got a lot of utility per price starting off with that first chocolate bar, a little less for that next chocolate bar,

6
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:28,055
but still more than we would get for a pound of fruit.

7
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:37,436
Then more for the next chocolate bar. And then, and only then, did we start buying some fruit, some pounds of fruit.

8
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:41,463
What I want to do in this video is generalize it. I want to think about maybe a more continuous case

9
00:00:41,463 --> 00:00:45,180
where we can buy very, very small increments of each of the products.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,060
It doesn't have to be in chunks, like chocolate bars.

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:56,327
And what I'm going to do is plot the marginal utility per price, which is really bang for your buck, on the vertical axis.

12
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:59,508
This right over here, on this axis.

13
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:02,169
This is the marginal utility per price.

14
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:06,996
And let's say it also goes from zero to 100. So that would be 50.

15
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:09,413
And the numbers don't actually matter so much here.

16
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:18,842
And then this will be dollars spent... dollars spent, or your buck.

17
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:21,374
So this is bang for your buck, and this is your buck.

18
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:29,632
This is one, two, three, four, five and six. Now we're going to do two arbitrary products.

19
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:33,997
So let's say one product looks something like this. And once again you have diminishing utility

20
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:38,257
as you get more and more of that product. In the case of fruit, the more pounds of fruit you get

21
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:45,502
the more tired you get of fruit, the less fruit you need or the less you want fruit for that next incremental pound.

22
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:49,776
It could be anything; this is true of most things.

23
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,910
So this is Product A. It could be a service as well.

24
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,444
So Product A. Let's write it this way.

25
00:01:55,444 --> 00:02:02,758
So this is the marginal utility for A per price of A.

26
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:05,441
Now let me get another product right over here.

27
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:15,413
So let's say my other product would look something like this. So this is my marginal utility for Product B per price of B.

28
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:17,712
So it's really saying Bang for the Buck.

29
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:22,835
So just to start off -- and I won't even constrain how much money we have.

30
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:25,445
I just want to think about how we would spend that money.

31
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:29,836
So if I were to spend -- if I had a penny, where would I spend that penny?

32
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:32,914
And I'm assuming I can buy these in super-small chunks,

33
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:36,181
as small as maybe the penny or even fractions of a penny.

34
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:41,376
So if I just had a penny, and I think about 'where am I getting the best bang for my buck for that penny?'

35
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:43,503
I'm clearly getting it with Product A.

36
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:47,251
So I would spend that penny on Product A and I would get this much bang for my buck.

37
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:52,778
Which would be this entire part, this entire part right over here.

38
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:56,995
Let me color it in. So first I'll spend it right on A.

39
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:00,827
Let me do it in a color that's more likely to be seen, this blue color.

40
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:04,256
So I'll spend it on A. In fact, where would I spend my first dollar?

41
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:07,367
Well, for the whole first dollar I'm getting a better bang for my buck on A.

42
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:14,336
So my first dollar, I'll spend on A. And the total utility I'll get is actually going to be the area under this curve.

43
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:18,848
It's going to be this whole area: it's going to be dollars times marginal utility price.

44
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:22,775
That would obviously give you the area of this rectangle right over here.

45
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:27,665
The reason why it wouldn't be the area of this larger rectangle - it would just be the area under the curve -

46
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:33,772
is you're not getting the 100 marginal utility per price for the entire dollar.

47
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:36,080
It's going down the entire time.

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,376
And so your actual total marginal utility is just the area under this.

49
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:43,666
And if you take calculus you'll get a better appreciation for that.

50
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,585
But let's just think about once again where our dollar is going to be spent.

51
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:53,776
Actually, even after we already spent a dollar our next penny we'd still want to spend on Product A

52
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:56,169
because we're still getting more bang for the buck.

53
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,337
We're still getting more bang for the buck all the way till right around there.

54
00:04:01,337 --> 00:04:05,447
Now something interesting is happening. So we've spent about two dollars.

55
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:09,083
We spent our first two dollars all on Product A because we're getting more bang for our buck,

56
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:14,341
even though that bang was diminishing every penny or fraction of a penny that we spent.

57
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:18,104
But now, where will we spend our next penny?

58
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:20,787
Well, we could spend it on Product A again.

59
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:25,511
But look. We can get about the same marginal utility spending in on Product B.

60
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:28,772
So we can jump right over there and spend it on Product B.

61
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:31,120
Now where could we spend our next dollar?

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,774
Well, we get about the same marginal utility whether we spend it on a little bit more of Product B or a little bit more of Product A.

63
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:39,763
So we could do either. If we spend a little bit too much on Product A

64
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:43,707
then we could have gotten more marginal utility spending on Product B.

65
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:49,449
So what we would do is, once we've gotten to this threshold right about here

66
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,592
we actually are going to spend every incremental fraction of a penny

67
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,839
we're actually going to want a split between Product A and Product B.

68
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:01,584
If we spend too much on one and we go down this curve we could've gotten higher utility on this one.

69
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:06,257
If we spent too much on this one we could get higher utility spending on this one right over here.

70
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:08,924
So there's a very interesting phenomenon here.

71
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:11,923
Assuming that we eventually spent enough that we buy some of both --

72
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:17,831
obviously we started just buying Product A because it had higher utility, at least for those first few dollars.

73
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:22,372
But assuming that we end up buying some mix of the two, which we do end up spending

74
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:31,036
if we spend more than $2, there's an interesting thing: the marginal utility for a project -- the marginal utility for B

75
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:34,913
or the marginal utility for price for B that I spent on that last little increment

76
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:40,772
is going to be the same as the marginal utility per price for that last increment of A.

77
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:46,980
So if B was, I don't know, if it was fruit and let's say A was chocolate

78
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,420
but we could buy it in very, very small increments

79
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,108
we're saying for that last fraction of a pound of fruit

80
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:57,858
you're spending or getting the same marginal utility per price

81
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:02,980
as you're getting for that last fraction of a bar or fraction of a pound of chocolate.

82
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,606
So there's a general principle, and it really just comes from this very straightforward thing:

83
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:11,447
that as soon as you can get better marginal utility on the other one you start spending there.

84
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:15,345
But then they start to look equal and you would keep dividing your money between the two.

85
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:19,305
So the general principal: if you're allocating money between two goods

86
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:24,712
for that last increment - not across the board, just that last increment (that's why the word marginal is so important) -

87
00:06:24,712 --> 00:06:28,173
for that last ounce of chocolate vs. that very last ounce of fruit

88
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:35,976
the marginal utility per price for that last increment of one good

89
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:44,265
would be the same as the marginal utility per price of the second good.

90
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:46,709
Now I really want to emphasize what this is saying.

91
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:51,108
This is not saying that the marginal utililties per price of the two goods are the same.

92
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,675
And not even that one is better than the other.

93
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:57,438
This is just saying as you spend money - let's say you spend enough money to buy both -

94
00:06:57,438 --> 00:07:02,016
at some point you're going to get to a threshold where you're neutral between the two,

95
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:09,008
where the marginal utility per price is the same for an incremental of B vs. an incremental of A.

96
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:14,182
And at that point you're just going to keep switching between the two products.

97
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:17,004
Because obviously if you focus too much on this right over here --

98
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:24,040
let's say you focus, at that point you switch and just start buying a bunch of Product B over here.

99
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,443
Well, that didn't make sense because you were buying Product B

100
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:30,428
when you could have gotten higher marginal utility buying some of product A.

101
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:33,586
And that's the same reason why you didn't just keep going down A,

102
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,767
because you could've gotten higher marginal utility over here.

103
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:38,774
This is closer to, I don't know, 75

104
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:42,000
while you're only getting 70 right over here.
