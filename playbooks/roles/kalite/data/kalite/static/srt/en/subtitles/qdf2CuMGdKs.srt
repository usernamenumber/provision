1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,970
I've got this 2 by 2 matrix A
here, and I've got this other

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,490
member of R2, this vector b.

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,310
Let's figure out all of the
interesting things that we can

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,370
figure out about this matrix
and this vector.

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,910
So the first thing of interest,
and this is all

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,650
going to essentially help us
visualize what we learned in

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,720
the last video, is the
null space of A.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,340
   

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,130
To figure out the null space
of A, we know that the null

11
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,730
space of A is equal to the null
space of the reduced row

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,525
echelon form of A.

13
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:35,350
So let's just find out the
reduced row echelon form of A.

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,830
Let's say we leave the
first row the same,

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,060
we get 3 minus 2.

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,600
And let's replace the second row
with the second row, minus

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,750
2 times the first, so 6,
minus 2 times 3 is 0.

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,630
And minus 4, minus 2
times minus 1 is 0.

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,240
And then let's replace the first
row with the first row

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,950
divided by 3.

21
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,070
So then that becomes 1 minus
2/3, and the second

22
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,420
row is still 0.

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,700
So that's the reduced row
echelon form of A.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,820
And we want to find
its null space.

25
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,150
So we want to find all of
the vectors that we

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,610
can multiply it by.

27
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,150
So this is the vector x1,
x2, that is equal to

28
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,460
the 0 vector in R2.

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,050
So the second row gives us no
information, 0 times x1, plus

30
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,240
0 times x2 is equal to 0.

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
No information there.

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,180
So our only constraint
is the first row.

33
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:31,710
1 times x1-- let me write it
here-- so 1 times x1, plus--

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,950
let me write it this way--
minus 2/3 times x2 is

35
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,160
equal to that 0.

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,630
Is equal to that
0 right there.

37
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:51,470
Or we could write that x1
is equal to 2/3 x2.

38
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:59,090
So if we wanted to write the
null space of A-- actually,

39
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,490
before I write that, just to
simplify things and just to

40
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,030
show you that x2 isn't some
special number, let's just say

41
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,600
that x2 is equal to t, where
t is some real number.

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,620
And then we would have x1
is equal to 2/3 times t.

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,130
So the null space of our matrix,
the null space of A,

44
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,500
is going to be equal to the set
of all x1, x2's, that are

45
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,480
equal to some real number
t times the vector.

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,990
   

47
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,480
x2 is equal to t times 1, and
x1 is equal to 2/3 t.

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,500
So 2/3, 1.

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,520
Just like that.

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,350
That is our null space.

51
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,940
All of the multiples of
the vector 2/3, 1.

52
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,910
And actually just to make this
a little bit simpler, we can

53
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,300
pick c, let's pick t,
sorry, let's pick t

54
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,620
to be equal to 3c.

55
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,435
So then what do you have?

56
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:09,870
If this is equal to 3c, if you
multiply the 3 times these, we

57
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:16,500
could rewrite this as being
equal to the x1's, x2's that

58
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,810
are equal to the scalar c, where
that is some other real

59
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:28,230
number, times 3 times 2/3
is 2, 3 times 1 is 3.

60
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,700
And the whole reason why I did
that is just to write the null

61
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,100
space with a slightly simpler
basis vector.

62
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,790
The one that didn't have
any fractions in it.

63
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,490
Or we could also write that
the null space is

64
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,470
equal to the span.

65
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,980
The span of the vector 2, 3.

66
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,580
All of these statements
are equivalent.

67
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,230
So we figured out
the null space.

68
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,800
Maybe another interesting thing,
especially if we're

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,400
going to make this relate to
what we did in the last video,

70
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,760
is find a solution set to the
equation Ax is equal to b.

71
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,990
To do that, we just set up
an augmented matrix.

72
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:07,970
So we set up an augmented
matrix, 3 minus 2, 6 minus 4,

73
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,460
and we augment it
with b, 9, 18.

74
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,290
And then we put the left-hand
side in reduced row echelon

75
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,589
form, and we get-- let's keep
the first row the same-- we

76
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,170
get 3 minus 2, and then 9.

77
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,480
Let's replace the second row
with the second row minus 2

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,690
times the first. So we get 6
minus 2 times 3, is 0, minus 4

79
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,600
minus 2 times minus 2,
that's 0 as well.

80
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
Minus 4 plus 4.

81
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,380
18 minus 2 times 9, that's 18
minus 18, that's also 0.

82
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,870
Almost there.

83
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,660
Now let's just replace the first
row with the first row

84
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,150
divided by 3.

85
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,900
So the second row is going
to stay the same.

86
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:57,800
And the first row is going to
be 1 minus 2/3, and then we

87
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,300
get a 3 there.

88
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,280
So if we wanted to rewrite this
is as an equation, we

89
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:14,080
would write that the matrix 1
minus 2/3, 0, 0, times the

90
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,420
vector that's in our solution
set, x1, x2, is equal to the

91
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,920
vector 3, 0.

92
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,560
Or another way to say it, the
second row gives us no real

93
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,950
constraint, so we don't have
to pay attention to it.

94
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,930
The first row tells us that
x1 minus 2/3, times

95
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,120
x2 is equal to 3.

96
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Or, that x1 is equal
to 3, plus 2/3 x2.

97
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,320
Let's do the same
exercise here.

98
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,790
If we say that x2 is equal
to t, then x1 is

99
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,570
equal to 3 plus 2/3t.

100
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,140
Or we could say that the
solution set to Ax is equal to

101
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:08,450
b is equal to the set of all x1,
x2's that are equal to--

102
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:15,010
let's see, x1 is equal to 3 plus
2/3, so plus t times 2/3.

103
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,520
   

104
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,770
Let's write it like that.

105
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,630
   

106
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,300
So plus right there.

107
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,900
And x2 is just equal to t, so
let's just go 1 times t plus,

108
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,660
well let's just say 0.

109
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,330
So that's our solution
set right there.

110
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,060
And you might immediately
recognize that it's some

111
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,185
particular solution plus some
scaled up version of our null

112
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:40,490
space right there.

113
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,690
That's our solution set.

114
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,620
I could do that same
substitution

115
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,950
that we did over here.

116
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,990
I could say that let's replace
t with 3c, and so we could

117
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,980
rewrite this as being equal to--
let's rewrite it neatly--

118
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:02,750
x1, x2 is equal to the vector--
I'm going to run out

119
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,140
of space-- 3, 0, plus c, times--
let me scroll over a

120
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:14,390
little bit-- plus c, times the
vector, 3 times 2/3 is 2, 3

121
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,640
times 1 is 3.

122
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,390
   

123
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,365
So it's equal to the vector 3, 0
plus some member of our null

124
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:23,060
space, right?

125
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,410
The null space was the span
of 2, 3, or all the scalar

126
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,380
multiples of our null space.

127
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,060
And this is where c is
any real number.

128
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,540
So that's our solution set.

129
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,140
That's our null space.

130
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,160
Now, one other thing that might
be of interest, just

131
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,540
because it's the orthogonal
complement to the null space,

132
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,540
and this relates to what we were
doing in the last video,

133
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,970
is what the row space of A is.

134
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,130
So the row space of
A is just the

135
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,000
column space of A transpose.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,230
This is the row space.

137
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,540
This is the row space of A.

138
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,700
And what is this equal to?

139
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,510
This is equal to the span
of the row vectors of A.

140
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:09,560
So we have 3 minus 2, and
we have 6 minus 4.

141
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,490
   

142
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,170
But this guy is just 2 times
that vector right there, so we

143
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,950
can just ignore it.

144
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:23,690
So it's just the span of
the vector 3 minus 2.

145
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,950
Now let's graph all of these.

146
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,200
So we have the row space, we
have the solution set and we

147
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,040
have the null space.

148
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,100
Let's see if we can graph it.

149
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,190
We can make a reasonable graph
of this thing right here.

150
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,309
So I have my vertical
axis right there.

151
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:47,780
I have my horizontal
axis right there.

152
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,820
Now what does the null
space look like?

153
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,310
It's all the multiples
of 2, 3.

154
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:59,800
So if I go out 1, 2 and then I
go up 1, 2, 3, the vector 2, 3

155
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,970
looks like this in the
standard position.

156
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,975
And the null space is all of
the multiples of this.

157
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:07,890
So, all the multiples of that.

158
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,290
So if you do all the multiples
of that, you get a line that

159
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,156
looks something like this.

160
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:15,400
If you do all the multiples of
that vector, you get a bunch

161
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,740
of vectors that point to
every point on this

162
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,910
green line right there.

163
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,440
So that right there is
the null space of A.

164
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,250
Now what is the solution set?

165
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,610
The solution set is
the vector 3, 0.

166
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,540
So it is the vector
3, 0, so 1, 2, 3.

167
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,070
So it is the vector 3 , 0, plus

168
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,430
members of the null space.

169
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,090
So if you take any of these --
let's say if you add 2, 3-- 2,

170
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,160
3 would look like this.

171
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,100
But you're adding any
multiple of 2, 3.

172
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,690
So when you add all the
different multiples of 2, 3,

173
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,850
you get this line right here.

174
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,020
It's shifted, essentially,
by that vector 3, 0.

175
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,630
So this right here is
the solution set.

176
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:04,320
So solution to Ax
is equal to b.

177
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,350
That's the solution
set right there.

178
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,510
Now, what's our row space?

179
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,520
The row space is all of
the multiples of the

180
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,700
vector 3 minus 2.

181
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,610
So what does 3 minus
2 look like?

182
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,940
The vector 3 minus 2, we go 1,
2, 3, and then we go down 2.

183
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,150
So you go 1, 2, and it's going
to look like this.

184
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,760
That's going to look something
like this, and then if you

185
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,920
were to graph it and you can
see, well, it's going to look

186
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,230
something like-- I want to do it
relatively neatly-- so it's

187
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,280
going to look something
like this.

188
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,420
Let me do it in another
color actually.

189
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,700
It's going to look like
that right-- I can't

190
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,090
do it at all straight.

191
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,850
Oh, this is horrible.

192
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,570
Something about the bottom right
hand side of my-- that's

193
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,760
a pretty decent attempt.

194
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,400
So that right there
is my row space.

195
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,470
Because if you have 3 minus 2
you get roughly to that point,

196
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,840
and then you want all
of the multiples of

197
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,160
that vector, right?

198
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,450
3 minus 2, if you multiplied it
by minus 1, you would get

199
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,580
the vector minus 3, 2, so
it would look like this.

200
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,160
It would be minus 3, 2.

201
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,100
It would look like this, 1, 2,
3 and then up 2, it would be

202
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,820
like that, so all of the scalar

203
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,160
multiples of that as well.

204
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,050
That is our column space,.

205
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,050
And notice-- I'm sorry that is
our row space-- and notice

206
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,940
that our row space is orthogonal
to our null space.

207
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,480
   

208
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,830
Now this is a nice visual
representation of everything

209
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,150
we can do essentially with this
matrix right here, which

210
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,900
is our matrix A.

211
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,170
But in the last video, we had
a very interesting result.

212
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,310
We had a very interesting
result.

213
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,120
We said that if we have some
b-- let me do it in a new

214
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,840
color-- we found out that if we
had some b that is a member

215
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,450
of the column space of A, then
the solution with the smallest

216
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,930
length, or we can say the
smallest, or the shortest

217
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:28,700
solution to Ax is equal to b is
a unique member of the row

218
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,570
space of A.

219
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,310
Now let's see, this is our big
takeaway from the last video.

220
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,410
And it might have seemed
a little hard

221
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,960
to visualize before.

222
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,900
But now that we have graphed
it all out, I think we can

223
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,110
visualize it.

224
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,920
This blue line right here
is a solution set.

225
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,510
The row space right here is this
line that's perpendicular

226
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,340
to the solution set.

227
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:57,600
But notice, one of the vectors
on it is both pointing to

228
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,300
something, pointing to a
position on the solution set,

229
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,110
and it is in my row space.

230
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,760
This vector right here, that
I'm doing in a bold green,

231
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,870
That vector right there, we
could call that vector r,

232
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,220
because that vector is both a
member of my row space, right?

233
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,990
It points-- if you do it as a
position vector, it points to

234
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,300
a point on the line that
represents our row space.

235
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,230
All of the members of our
row space point to

236
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,990
points on this line.

237
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,240
But at the same time, it also
points to a point right there

238
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,440
that is a member of
our solution set.

239
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,470
And notice, it is the only
vector in our row space that

240
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,820
points to a point that is a
member of our solution set.

241
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,120
And if you just look at it
from a geometric point of

242
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,880
view, all of the other solutions
point to all of the

243
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,860
other points on that line.

244
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,490
So, that's a solution right
there, this is a solution

245
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,850
right there, that is a
solution right there.

246
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,300
All of the vectors that point
to things on this solution

247
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,790
line right there, there's
all solutions.

248
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,940
But the very shortest one
is this green one.

249
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,540
This green one is essentially
orthogonal to it because it's

250
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,080
a member of the row space.

251
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,000
And this essentially has the
same slope as our null space.

252
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's orthogonal, so it's kind of
the shortest path distance

253
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,800
to getting to our
solution set.

254
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,580
And for this exact example, we
can actually figure out what

255
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,480
this shortest vector r is.

256
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,280
We've got the vector 3,
0, over here, right?

257
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,730
The vector 3, 0 is this
vector right here.

258
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,690
So if you take 3, 0 minus your
vector-- so let me say r.

259
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,010
Let me write this way.

260
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,600
Our vector r, the special
shortest solution, it's going

261
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,570
to be a member of our
column space.

262
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,585
Our column space is a
span of 3 minus 2.

263
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:42,180
So it's going to be equal
to some scalar

264
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,440
multiple of 3 minus 2.

265
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,570
Now, we know that 3, 0 points
to another solution on our

266
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,750
solution set.

267
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,970
But we know that if we take the
difference of these two

268
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:03,080
vectors-- if I take 3, 0 and
from that I subtract the

269
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,990
vector r, what do I get?

270
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,740
I get this vector right there.

271
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,690
Let me do that in
another color.

272
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,310
I get this pink vector
right there.

273
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,300
That pink vector, it's not in a
standard position, but that

274
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,390
pink vector is going to be a
member of our null space.

275
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,570
That pink vector is going to be
a member of our null space.

276
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,130
So if I take 3, 0.

277
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:30,770
That, minus my r, so minus c,
times 3 minus 2, right?

278
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,550
That's going to be this pink
vector right there.

279
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,480
So if I were to take the dot
product, so this vector right

280
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,130
here-- let me make this clear;
that vector is this pink

281
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,700
vector right there-- that's
in my null space.

282
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,220
I could shift it over.

283
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,700
It's not in standard position
there, but [? I'll have to ?]

284
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,030
do it in the standard position,
it points to

285
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,450
something on my null
space line.

286
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,700
So that's in my null space.

287
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,980
So if I were to dot it with any
member of my row space,

288
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,350
it's going to be equal to 0.

289
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,820
The row space is the orthogonal
complement of the

290
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,890
null space.

291
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,750
So let me take the dot product
of that, with some member of

292
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,140
my row space.

293
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,940
Might as well just take the
basis vector for my row space.

294
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,780
That's a member of
my row space.

295
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,990
So if I dot it with 3-- sorry, I
don't want you to write that

296
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,430
as a fraction-- 3 minus 2.

297
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,120
If I dot it with 3 minus 2,
that will be equal to 0.

298
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,640
So let's see if we
can solve for c.

299
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,770
So we get, let's see if we do
this, we get this inside part,

300
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,610
this pink vector right
there is going to

301
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,520
be 3 minus 3c, right?

302
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,180
And then you're going to
have 0 minus minus 2c,

303
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,430
so that's just 2c.

304
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,720
   

305
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
So this part right here
simplifies to that.

306
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,280
I just perform the scalar
multiplication and then the

307
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,360
subtraction.

308
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,530
And then if we dot that with
my basis vector for my row

309
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,530
space, 3 minus 2, this
should be equal to 0.

310
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,690
So what do we get?

311
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:03,090
We get 3 times 3, which is 9,
minus-- let me see, 3 times

312
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:10,140
3-- minus 3, or minus 3c times
minus 2-- let me write it this

313
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,700
way-- plus-- let me
do it this way.

314
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,950
This is probably the easiest
way to do it.

315
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,500
Sorry, I was actually
doing it wrong.

316
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,550
This is the first entry,
so you have 3 minus

317
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,180
3c, times 3, right?

318
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,359
3 minus 3c-- the first entry
times the first entry here--

319
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:34,090
plus 2c, times minus
2, is equal to 0.

320
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,930
I was performing that dot
product in a strange way.

321
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,650
I think I got a little caught
off guard by these two terms.

322
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,980
But anyway, the first term times
the first term, plus the

323
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,250
second term times
the second term.

324
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,610
That's what our dot
product is.

325
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,510
This isn't the matrix.

326
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,320
This is just a first and a
second term right there.

327
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,330
So then what do we have here?

328
00:17:51,330 --> 00:18:03,430
We have 3 times 3 is 9, minus
9c, minus 4c, is equal to 0.

329
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,190
This is 9 minus 13c
is equal to 0.

330
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,870
Or we get 13, let's see, 9
is equal to 13c, or c is

331
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,710
equal to 9 over 13.

332
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,610
So just like that we've solved
for our special vector r.

333
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,680
We said, hey look, if you take
this 3, 0 vector and the

334
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,620
difference between that and our
vector r, you're going to

335
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,620
get some vector, right here,
that is in our null space.

336
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,340
And if you take the dot product
of that with some

337
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,140
member in our row space,
you're going to get 0.

338
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,500
And the dot product is that
entry times that entry, plus

339
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,670
that entry times that entry.

340
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,030
And so you get c is equal
to 9 over 13.

341
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,700
So our special vector r, the
unique shortest solution to

342
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,140
the equation Ax is equal to 0,
is 9 over 13 times the vector,

343
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,170
times our basis vector 3 minus
2, or we could write that as

344
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,160
27 over 13, right?

345
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,530
And then we have 3 times--
and then 2 times 9 is

346
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,090
minus 18 over 13.

347
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:19,115
And that right there is our
shortest vector in our row

348
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:21,520
space that satisfies
this equation.

349
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,300
Let me write it better.

350
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,230
It's the unique member of our
row space that also happens to

351
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,980
be the shortest solution
to Ax is equal to b.

352
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,430
So this is an example of what
we talked about in the last

353
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,680
video, and hopefully you see
visually why this is so.
