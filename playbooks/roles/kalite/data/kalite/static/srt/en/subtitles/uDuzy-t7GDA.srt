1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we are looking at one of my favourite works of art

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from last 30 or 40 years.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is Damien Hirst.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'll admit that one of my favourite aspects of this work is its title.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I fell just those words could be a work of art.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean I'm not even looking at the shark.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The idea of the physcial impossibility of death

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the mind of someone living.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And there's different ways to parse that actually

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's either word play or deep and Ä± haven't figured that out yet.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It strikes me as this rage truth.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The impossibility of really coming to terms with death as someone

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who is living.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In many ways the history of art is a coming to terms with mortality of

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
transcending the physical body of the after life.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Art through history has dealt with big questions

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a work of art taking on those big questions.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly. the title I'm gonna think about all day.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's why we are so afraid of that.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because we just can't process it.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but what we are looking at is I'm assuming a non living shark.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a very large shark.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In a tank.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But what am I looking at actually?

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a real shark that was caught and

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and killed and suspended in a tank of formaldehyde.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is stationary. Although it looks like moving.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is stationary and it is in a kind of beautiful tank something that the artist

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
has sort of framing the shark in for us to see it.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so I mean well just go back to I guess both the title and it being a work of art.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'm starting to appreciate because you could put this in a natural history museum.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a shark. This is what a shark looks like.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Study it. It's like a stuffed bison or mammouth or something like it.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean the title combined with this makes me think.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean there is some obvious things here. It is dead.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean I mean I can interpret it.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I just feel like I've been making up stuff though.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think that's part of the idea.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When artists make things in the 20th and the 21st century

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they are more open to interpretation than art in the Renaissance.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are looking at art which is meant to be kind of open to interpretation.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is not just what the artist said it meant.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we are allowed to bring our own ideas and associations to it, to fill out its meaning, to complete it.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact Duchamp said that our work of art is completed by the viewer.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets talk about our associations with it.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes we are almost challenged that it is physically impossible to comprehend that in the mind of a living.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I believe I am living. So basically a title like this can.. I'm being told that I can't comprehend that.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then I'm just being faced with death right there. I mean I'm faced with a very big version of death.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
On kind of multiple dimensions I mean there's the.. The shark is dead although it looks like swimming.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But is also something that could kill me.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I were..as you know. this is poster of the movie Jaws. So it's a shark.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's few animals that according to humans as scary more than a big shark.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And when you stand in front of this it is scary to look at.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is like Oh My God I'm very close to something that could kill me.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And and I guess your brain keeps going back and forth am I really processing that here or am I fearful of this thing that I can't process and that's waht I'm afraid of.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Why couldn't he put a tiger?

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And maybe he could.He just chose to use a shark.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or a shark is more convincing or is just different. I mean he does use other animals.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is famous series where he slices sheep length wise and puts them in tanks.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is not the original shark.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In other words this sculpture now has a second shark.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because the first one dissolved.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Despite the formeldehyde it decayed and the formeldehyde is of course is trying to maintain the intactness of the shark.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And perhaps even its viciousness and its notion of livingness.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we fail. You know this still dissolves.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this still in a sense ..

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That wasn't by design though.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He intended this to be permanent.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think he is struggling to keep this shark intact.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's exactly right.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we don't have the means to do that.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But who isn't struggling to keep themselves intact?

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But but I guess here I'm feeling that there is a I guess I havent completed this level of interpretation.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because this feels like a completely inaverted side effect of how...

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The fact that you put a shark in formeldehyde. To me it implies that he was hoping that this would be around for a long time.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
His design did not hold up to time and so it is kind of falling apart.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But that wasn't the artists intention.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well it's interesting. By the time we get to the late 20th century artists are well versed in this idea of the impermenance of art.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That said a minute ago that art for its entire history it is trying to transcend human death.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And in fact one of the definitions one of the philosophical definitions about work of art is it is something that outlives us.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That it is trans generational.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But here is something that is not paint, here is something that is not marble,here is something that is flesh like we are.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And yet there is this vein attempt to have it outlive us and it doesn't.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think he knew.

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it wasnt just the design for it I mean. He could have stuck this in amber? or something. ..

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's too much too much art that has changed over time for him not to know.

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He is just too sophisticated.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The ancient Egyptians mummified bodies. I mean there's a whole history of human beings trying to stop time.

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We all know that we can use our best chemicals we can do plastic surgery we can do all sorts of things and nothing is going to stop the inevitability of...

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean he could have stuck it in the amber or something and...in that much more preserve..

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It would have been slower.

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It would have been yess..

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or he could have done something much more traditional which is he could have represented a shark and made it more permanant and that would..

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right right right.

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but by choosing the thing itself he created the impossibility of its own preservation.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yeah I mean my brain just keeps going back and forth.

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what is I mean the title by itself is all you need.

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you have a whole conceptual dimension.

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but then you have this absolutely physical dimension and you have this clash between the physical and that poetic.

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it is in that contradiction. it is in that confrontation that I think the art really exists.

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yeah I don't think it's just in the title. The title is lovely and really speaks to me. I admit it.

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But the title together with the sculpture is a really complicated experience.

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I feel like there should almost be a new type of museum called a philosophy museum.

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean especially if you look at like a classical art museum it is I mean it is about the history and the conversation that people are having in the.. but it is a lot about aesthetics.

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it seems like I mean you see that maybe actually modern art should be called philosophical art or a museum of philosophy.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because it really is I mean when I hear the word museum I feel it is wrong the museum seems to be let's preserve something that someone else has created.

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well it seems like a lot of this modern art is really about kind of put the philosophy in your face right now without an answer.

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I I I don't know whether I'm being ??

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Think that question about sort of always being a little bit worried about this being a kind of grand joke in some way.

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is always there and it is something that it gets given voice quite a bit in part because

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in art now almost nothing is off limits.

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And artists find ways of asking profound questions about things that can be very mundane or seem overtly silly.

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but can actually

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or intentionally shocking.

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
absolutely.

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think in some ways the art world asks for that cyncism.

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But on the other hand that doesn't mean the profound ideas aren't being asked.
