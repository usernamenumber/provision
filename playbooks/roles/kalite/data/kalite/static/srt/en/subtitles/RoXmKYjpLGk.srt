1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
   

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,580
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,340
I just want to do a couple more
of these problems, just so you,

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,440
I guess, see a few couple more
problems and get some practice.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,040
So let's start with
another problem.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,440
As always, let me
draw my triangle.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,270
I always like to draw
it a little different

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,240
to confuse you.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:34,410
Let's say that this angle
up here is 0.36 radians.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,990
An angle is 0.36 radians, and
then this side right here, this

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:44,390
top side-- let me do it in a
different color-- this top side

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:53,190
in pink is square root of
73 units long or whatever.

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,800
It could be inches or
feet or whatever.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,690
But it's square root
of 73 units long.

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:05,060
So my question is, what is this
side here, this green side?

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,350
Well, how did we do this
type of problem last time?

17
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,600
We should figure out what
sides we're dealing with.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,040
Are we dealing with the
adjacent and the opposite, the

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,460
adjacent and the hypotenuse,
the opposite and the

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,050
hypotenuse, and then we'll know
which trig functions we

21
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,370
should be dealing with.

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,960
So we know this side, this pink
side-- and this pink side, it

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,090
should be almost second
nature by now, is the

24
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:28,450
hypotenuse, right?

25
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,050
It's the longest side, and it's
opposite the right angle.

26
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,600
So we know the hypotenuse,
and what are we solving for?

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,480
Well, this is the angle we
know, so we're solving

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,000
for the opposite side.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,520
So we're solving for the
opposite side, and we know the

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,000
hypotenuse, so what trig
function will we probably use?

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,360
Let's write out our mnemonic.

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,540
SOH CAH TOA.

33
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,120
So what did I say before?

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,600
We're solving for the opposite
sign, and we know the

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,245
hypotenuse, so we are going to
use the opposite and

36
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:02,470
the hypotenuse.

37
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,600
So which of these is that?

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
The opposite and the
hypotenuse, the o

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,420
and the h, right?

40
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,460
It's SOH, right?

41
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,250
And SOH says that sine is
equal to the opposite

42
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,180
over the hypotenuse.

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,050
Sine of an angle-- in this
case, it's this angle-- sine of

44
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,900
0.36 radians-- remember, this
is radians we're dealing with,

45
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,910
not degrees-- is equal
to the opposite side.

46
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,730
And the opposite side is this
green side right here, so I'll

47
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,920
just write opposite instead of
writing o because o would look

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,720
like a 0-- is equal to the
opposite side over the

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,470
hypotenuse, right?

50
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,920
This is just sine is equal to
opposite over hypotenuse.

51
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,130
Well, what's the
hypotenuse length?

52
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,240
Well, it's the
square root of 73.

53
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,600
   

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,970
These are p's, by the way.

55
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,850
I know they don't look
like p's, but opposite.

56
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:58,350
So the opposite side-- we're
just multiplying both sides by

57
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,680
the square root of 73-- is
equal to the square root of 73

58
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,200
times the sine of 0.36 radians.

59
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,450
Now, once again, I don't know
what the sign of 0.36 radians

60
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,440
is in my head, but I'll
tell you the answer.

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,000
The sine of 0.36 radians is
equal to-- I'm just rewriting

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,630
this-- the sine of 0.36
radians, if you looked it up on

63
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,550
a table or if you used your
calculator in radian mode, is 3

64
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,870
square roots of 73 over 73.

65
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,560
And, of course, your calculator
is going to give you

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,420
something-- it'll give
you some decimal number.

67
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,390
I won't write it this way.

68
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,470
So just remember, this is this.

69
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,490
And I just looked that up.

70
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,270
There's no magic there.

71
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,740
And the square root-- or you
could use a calculator.

72
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,020
On the Khan Academy, when you
do problems, it'll actually

73
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,270
tell you what it is, so you
don't have to use a calculator.

74
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,350
So now we just simplify.

75
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,660
Square root of 73 times square
root of 73 is 73 over 73 is

76
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,760
equal to 1, so these
all cancel out.

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,340
And we get the answer of 3.

78
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,510
So this side right here is 3.

79
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,900
And just out of curiosity, if
you wanted to solve for this

80
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,460
side, there's two ways
we could do it, right?

81
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,680
We could use the Pythagorean
theorem, because, you know, a

82
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,520
squared plus b squared is
equal to c squared, or we

83
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,510
could use trigonometry.

84
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,400
I'll let you guess
what trig function--

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,490
actually, let's do that.

86
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,330
Let's figure out that side
using trigonometry, and then

87
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,200
let's figure out that side
using the Pythagorean theorem,

88
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,600
just to show that everything
fits together in math.

89
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,660
So I wrote that 3 there, so I
can erase all of this stuff.

90
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:51,610
   

91
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,050
Let me erase it.

92
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,110
   

93
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,840
I shouldn't have
erased the SOHCAHTOA.

94
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,570
Actually, we should have
that memorized by now.

95
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:02,920
SOHCAHTOA.

96
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,240
   

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,560
All right, so let's figure out
what this orange side is here.

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,150
And if you think about it, we
could do it a bunch of ways.

99
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,110
We could say, well, this is
the adjacent side, right?

100
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,990
Because we know the opposite
and we know the hypotenuse.

101
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,020
So we could either use-- we
know the opposite, so we could

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,260
say what trig function uses the
opposite and the adjacent?

103
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,540
Well, that's tangent
function, right?

104
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:35,970
So we could say tangent
of 0.36-- let's call

105
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,110
this side A, right?

106
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,720
A for adjacent.

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,210
Tangent of 0.36 is equal
to the opposite, 3, over

108
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,770
the adjacent, over A.

109
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,720
Is there another trigonometry
way we could think about this?

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,580
Well, we also know
the hypotenuse.

111
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,730
What trig function uses the
hypotenuse and the adjacent?

112
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,940
Well, if you remember,
SOH CAH TOA.

113
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,730
CAH, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

114
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:11,260
So we could say cosine of
0.36 is equal to adjacent

115
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,040
over square root of 73.

116
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,630
And I'll just write SOHCAHTOA
here, just so you can

117
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,900
confirm what I'm doing.

118
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,660
The TOA says the tangent is
equal to the opposite, 3, over

119
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,840
the adjacent, and CAH tells us
the cosine is equal to the

120
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,810
adjacent over the hypotenuse.

121
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,300
So we could solve
either one of these.

122
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,820
If we use the second formula,
we would get the adjacent side

123
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:48,980
is equal to the square root of
73 times the cosine of 0.36,

124
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,610
and then if you use your
calculator in radian mode, or

125
00:06:51,610 --> 00:07:01,650
I'll just tell you, that cosine
of 0.36 radians is equal to 8

126
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,810
square roots of 73 over 73.

127
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,300
And you can confirm that by
getting a decimal number and

128
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,780
then-- making sure once again
your calculator is not in

129
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,880
degree mode, but
in radian mode.

130
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,370
I think that's actually the
default mode in a lot of

131
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,960
calculators-- and
solving for this.

132
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,720
But once again, the 73, this
square root of 73 times this

133
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,100
square root of 73, is equal to
73, and then divided by 73.

134
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,720
These all cancel out.

135
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,320
How convenient, huh?

136
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,460
And you get 8.

137
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,220
So the adjacent side
is equal to 8.

138
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,500
And so if we'd solved for A
here using the tangent

139
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,300
function, we should've also
gotten the adjacent

140
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,570
side is equal to 8.

141
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,510
And just to show you that
everything works out from other

142
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:49,250
concepts, let me show you this
using the Pythagorean theorem.

143
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,990
   

144
00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:03,100
So 8 squared plus 3
squared should equal

145
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,970
the hypotenuse squared.

146
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,100
The square root of 73 squared.

147
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,530
Well, 8 squared is 64 plus 9
should equal-- what's the

148
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,820
square root of 73 squared?

149
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,690
Right, it's 73.

150
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,250
And, of course,
64 plus 9 is 73.

151
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,600
And sure enough, that
equals 73, so it works.

152
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,470
Isn't that interesting how math
just kind of fits together?

153
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,180
I think at this point you're
ready to try the modules, the

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,790
Trigonometry II modules, and I
guess let me know if you

155
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,510
have any problems, or if you
want to see more videos.

156
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,010
Have fun!

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,800
