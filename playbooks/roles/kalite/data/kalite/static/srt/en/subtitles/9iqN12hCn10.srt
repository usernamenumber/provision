1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,250
All right, let's keep
converting Cartesian functions

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,940
to polar coordinates.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:14,120
The next one I have here is
3y minus 7x is equal to 10.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,620
I cut and pasted our tool
kit here, and let's

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,110
see what we can do.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,160
We want to convert this to
a function of r and theta.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,350
So the simplest thing,
we have a y and an x,

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,320
we just substitute.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,930
We know that y is equal to r
sine of theta and x is equal

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,110
to r cosine of theta, so
let's just substitute.

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,180
So 3 times y, well, y is the
same thing as r sine of

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,740
theta minus 7 times x.

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,550
Well, that's 7 times r cosine
theta is equal to-- now,

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,860
remember, these just came from
SOHCAHTOA, nothing

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,080
fancier than that.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,320
Let's see if we can simplify
this or write it explicitly

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,590
in terms of theta.

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:59,460
So we could factor out an r, so
you get r times 3 sine theta

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,865
minus 7 cosine theta, right?

21
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:04,230
We just factored out an r,
and that's equal to 10.

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,960
And now divide both sides by
this big expression, and you're

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,860
left with r is equal to 10, 3
sine of theta-- 10 divided by 3

24
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,370
sine of theta minus
7 cosine of theta.

25
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,870
And we could also write this,
you know, we could say, well,

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,400
this r is a function of theta.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,800
We could write r of
theta, right? r is a

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,840
function of theta.

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,480
I just felt like doing that so
that you could show that the

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,130
function notation even works
in polar coordinates.

31
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,980
Let's do another one.

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,080
Let me cut and paste
our tool kit.

33
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,740
Look at that.

34
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,480
All right, next one.

35
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,760
So it says y is equal
to 2x minus 3.

36
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,880
Well, we can do the same thing.

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,390
We know what y and x are in
terms of r and theta. y is

38
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,780
equal to r sine of theta,
so let's write that.

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,130
r sine of theta is
equal to 2 times x.

40
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,420
Well, x is r cosine
of theta minus 3.

41
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,440
Let's see if we can separate
the r's and thetas, so let's

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,170
subtract this from both sides.

43
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:17,490
So we get r sine of theta
minus 2r cosine of theta

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,560
is equal to minus 3.

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,050
Just like the last problem, we
can factor an r out, so we get

46
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:31,010
r times sine of theta minus 2
cosine of theta is

47
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,990
equal to minus 3.

48
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,190
Now, divide both sides by this
expression, so you're left with

49
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,930
r is equal to minus 3 divided
by sine of theta minus

50
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,450
2 cosine of theta.

51
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,240
There you go.

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,680
Now they want us to
do some problems.

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,110
Let me clear everything.

54
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,220
I want to do some problems.

55
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,130
We're going to convert
the other way.

56
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,890
Let's write our tool kit down.

57
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,380
It's proved to be useful.

58
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,170
All right, now they want to
convert from polar to Cartesian

59
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,560
coordinates, and so they give
us the polar function r is

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,800
equal to 4 sine of theta.

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,290
So how do we convert this
into a function of x and y?

62
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:15,950
So let's see here.

63
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,190
There's no obvious-- let's
think about it a little bit.

64
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,240
So we know we have this
equation y is equal

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,510
to r sine of that.

66
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,290
So can we write sine of theta?

67
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,190
Well, let me do a
little side here.

68
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,690
So y is equal to
r sine of theta.

69
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,900
If we divide both sides
by r, what do we get?

70
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,500
We get y/r is equal to
sine of theta, right?

71
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,460
Well, that seems to be helpful.

72
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,350
We have a sine of theta there,
and then we have something that

73
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,550
at least it gets sort of the
theta out of the equation.

74
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,460
We're still left with an
r, but it makes it a

75
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,610
lot easier to look at.

76
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,250
So let's do that.

77
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,970
Sine of theta is equal to y/r,
so let's substitute that there.

78
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,470
So we get r is equal to
4 times sine of theta,

79
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,055
which is y/r, so 4y/r.

80
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:59,640
   

81
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,140
We can multiply both sides of
the equation by r, and you're

82
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,930
left with r squared
is equal to 4y.

83
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,570
And we know what r
squared is equal to.

84
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,260
It tells us right there.
r squared is equal to x

85
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,250
squared plus y squared.

86
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:16,820
So you get x squared plus
y squared is equal to 4y.

87
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,490
And there we have it.

88
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,950
We have it at least
in an implicit form.

89
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,410
We don't have an explicit
equation, but I think that's

90
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,100
good enough for now.

91
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,300
So you see, it's really just a
lot of algebra and I guess a

92
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,190
little bit of trigonometry, but
really a lot of algebra and

93
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,880
just kind of figuring out
how to use this tool kit.

94
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,610
Let's do a couple more.

95
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,780
So let's say-- let me
paste the tool kit.

96
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,020
Let's say that we have the
polar coordinates r is equal

97
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,360
to sine of theta plus
cosine of theta.

98
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,320
And just so you don't lose the
big picture of what we're

99
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,280
doing, we could graph this.

100
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,950
You could put your graphing
calculator on the polar

101
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,030
coordinates, and I'll do future
videos where we do graph it,

102
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,310
and it'll produce some graph.

103
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,200
As theta changes, as we go
around the circle, the radius

104
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,480
will change, and it'll
produce something.

105
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,810
I don't know what it might
look like, like flower

106
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,580
petals or something.

107
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,650
I don't know I'll have to-- I
don't have the intuition of

108
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,940
exactly what this'll look like,
but what we're saying is when

109
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,100
we convert to x and y, if you
actually graphed in the

110
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,210
Cartesian coordinates, it would
look the exact same way.

111
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,100
That's all we're doing.

112
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,210
How do you express the
same relationship in

113
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,010
terms of x and y's?

114
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,955
So how do we do this?

115
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:20,820
Well, in the last one, we can--
these two, we can rewrite.

116
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,540
We can divide both sides
of these equations by r.

117
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,770
This is the same thing
as sine of theta is

118
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,590
equal to y/r, right?

119
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,320
I just divide both sides by r.

120
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,120
And this is the same
thing as cosine of

121
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,140
theta is equal to x/r.

122
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,060
Just divided both sides
of this equation by

123
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,500
r, and you get this.

124
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,480
So now we can use this to
substitute back here, so r

125
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,740
is equal to sine of theta.

126
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,860
Well, we know that's equal to
y/r plus cosine of theta.

127
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,480
Well, cosine of theta
is equal to x/r.

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,200
   

129
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,762
And now we can multiply both
sides of this equation by r,

130
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:06,120
and we're left with r squared
is equal to y plus x.

131
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,980
And we know what r
squared is now.

132
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,160
That should be second
nature, hopefully.

133
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,240
So it's x squared plus
y squared, right?

134
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,760
That's r squared is
equal to x-- sorry,

135
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,990
is equal to y plus x.

136
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,570
There you go.

137
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,920
Let's do one more.

138
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,270
Let's do it without our
tool kit, and I'll do it

139
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,360
in a different color.

140
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,830
Let's say we had r is equal
to a squared, so they're

141
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,030
leaving it abstract.

142
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,990
But a is some constant, so we
hopefully know our intuition

143
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,410
from a couple of videos ago
that this should be

144
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,390
a circle, right?

145
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,630
If a was 3, then we'd say,
oh, r is equal to 9, right?

146
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,310
3 squared, and then there'd
just be a circle with a

147
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,400
constant radius of 9.

148
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,560
So how would you write this
in Cartesian coordinates?

149
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,940
Well, we know that x
squared plus y squared

150
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,490
is equal to r squared.

151
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,870
So one thing we could do,
maybe just square both

152
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,750
sides of this equation.

153
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,610
So you get r squared is equal
to-- what's a squared squared?

154
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,540
Well, it's a to the
fourth, right?

155
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,260
It's a to the 2 times
2, so a to the fourth.

156
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,220
And we know what r squared is.

157
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,750
It's x squared plus y squared,
so you get x squared plus y

158
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,920
squared is equal to
a to the fourth.

159
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,580
Not too bad.

160
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,050
Not too bad.

161
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,660
And that's really-- I mean,
that'll get you pretty far in

162
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,100
converting between Cartesian
and polar coordinates.

163
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,600
In the next video, we'll maybe
explore a couple of these

164
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,080
graphs to hopefully give you a
little intuition of really how

165
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,120
the relationships between
r and theta really works.

166
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,100
See you in the next video.

167
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,500
