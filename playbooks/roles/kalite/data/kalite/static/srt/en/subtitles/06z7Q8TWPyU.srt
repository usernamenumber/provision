1
00:00:00,837 --> 00:00:05,333
In the last video we learned that 380,000 years after the Big

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:09,600
Bang which is still roughly 13.7 billion years ago

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:17,000
every atom in space that was roughly 3000 kelvin temperature

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,933
was emitting this electromagnetic radiation

5
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:27,400
there are points in space or there are points in the universe

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,867
that that radiation is only just now reaching us, it

7
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:33,733
has been traveling for 13.7 billion years, so when

8
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,800
we look at radiation that has been traveling for

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,800
that long we can look at any direction and we will see this uniform radiation

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,234
that radiation has been red-shifted into the

11
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:46,556
microwave range from the higher frequencies that

12
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:48,600
it was actually emitted at

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,267
Now a question that might pop in your brain is

14
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,400
what happens if we wait a billion years ?

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,867
because if we wait a billion years, if we have a

16
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:59,533
billion 380.000 years after the beginning of the

17
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:02,933
universe, this stuff won't just be atoms anymore

18
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:06,333
it will have started to condense to actual stars

19
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:12,467
the universe at this point, at every point in space

20
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:15,952
will no longer be this uniform, it will actually start

21
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:22,133
having condensation into stars, so if we move

22
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,867
forward a little bit the universe will expand

23
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:26,400
maybe I will just draw a half of it since it's

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,267
expanding, it has obviously expanded much more

25
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:30,467
but now all of a sudden we actually have stars

26
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:33,467
these are no longer just uniformed atoms spread

27
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,806
through the universe, we actually have condensation

28
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:39,892
into stars and so if you look at what is being emitted

29
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,533
from the points of space from which we're only

30
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:45,000
now getting this cosmic background radiation

31
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:48,815
if we wait a billion years, the light that we see

32
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:52,467
from those points in space will not look like this

33
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:55,133
uniform radiation, it will start to look a little

34
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,200
bit more like the more mature parts of the universe

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,000
we'll essentially be looking at the universe a billion

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,823
years after the Big Bang when stars are formed,

37
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,033
other structures are formed, so the question is in

38
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,962
a billion years will this cosmic microwave background

39
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:13,143
radiation disappear ? I'm using billion just because that's

40
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:15,733
you know, just a arbitrarily used number

41
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:19,800
but will it eventually disappear ? and the answer to that is

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,067
yes and no, so to think about it, it is true that this

43
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:28,533
point in space will mature, it will mature in a billion

44
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:34,400
years, it will no longer be this uniform haze of hot

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,671
hydrogen atoms but what we have to think about is

46
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:43,333
there are further points in the universe at that same time

47
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,836
there are further points that were also emitting this

48
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:52,600
radiation and the original photons from those original

49
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,067
points still haven't gotten to us, so from those further

50
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:58,538
outpoints, right now the observable universe is

51
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:02,333
we can only see electromagnetic radiation that's been

52
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,267
travelling for 13.7 billion years and in another billion

53
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:07,600
years the universe will be a billion years older and then

54
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,067
there will be radiation that has been traveling for 14.7

55
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:13,800
billion years and so we will start to observe that

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,133
and we'll start to observe that radiation from the

57
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,800
same time period of the universe, it will just be from

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,667
further out. Now what I want to make clear is since those

59
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,667
points were even further out, where that radiation

60
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:28,800
was emitted, the stuff that we will see in a billion years

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,000
it will be even more red-shifted.

62
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:40,868
So at that point the cosmic backgroung radiation we see

63
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:44,862
will have longer wavelengths than the radio spectrum

64
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:47,800
it will be redder and I should say redder because we're

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:58,933
already more red than the microwave radiation of course

66
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,533
that's a funny thing because microwave radiation is already

67
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,600
more red than actual visible red light, it has a longer

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,873
wavelength. Now this will keep happening

69
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:13,467
we will keep getting radiation as we go further and further

70
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:16,133
into the future, we will keep getting radiation from further

71
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:20,333
outpoints in space and it will get more and more red-shifted

72
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,467
the actual wavelengths of that electromagnetic light

73
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,533
will be bigger and bigger and bigger

74
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:28,600
until we really aren't able to even see it as an electomagnetic light

75
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,667
because it will be red-shifted to infinity, it will have an

76
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:35,467
infinite wavelength and to make that point clear I want to

77
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:38,000
show you there will even be points, at some point

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,067
there will a kind of threshold where we can't even get

79
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,600
radiation from further out

80
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,133
let me show you, let me draw a diagram of that

81
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:51,000
so let's say that this is the universe 13.7 billion years ago

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,333
right with that radiation what we now see as cosmic

83
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:57,067
microwave background radiation right when it started to be emitted

84
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,600
and let's say that this is the point in the universe

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,867
where we are now, so this is "us"

86
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:07,600
let's say that this is the point in the universe that where

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,733
we now observe the background radiation

88
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,333
this is one of the points, we obviously could form a circle

89
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,511
around us, it could be any of these points over here

90
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:22,533
where the photons, the electromagnetic radiaton that

91
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:26,067
were emitted from this point 380 000 years after the

92
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:29,267
beginning of the universe is only just now reaching us

93
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:32,733
so this is the point in the universe from which we're

94
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,226
observing the cosmic background radiation

95
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:37,933
and let me be very clear, that point in the universe

96
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:41,733
has now matured into things that look, into stars

97
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,933
and galaxies and planets and if they were to look at

98
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,467
our point in space, they are also going to see cosmic

99
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,467
background radiation from us, it's not like this is

100
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:51,600
some type of permanently old place, it's just that the

101
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,242
light we're getting from them right now is old light

102
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:58,800
light that they at that point in space emitted way before

103
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,400
it was able to mature into actual structures

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,133
so this is the point in space from which we're

105
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:14,067
receiving cosmic background radiation right now.

106
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,558
Now let's take another point in space that's,

107
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:19,267
whatever this distance is, now it is estimated to be

108
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:24,801
around 46 billion light years, at that time when things

109
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,800
were just beginning to be emitted, this was only about

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,733
36 million light years. This is a very rough estimate I shouldn't

111
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:36,400
even write it down because that's really based on how

112
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,200
fast we assume the universe is expanding and all that type of thing

113
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,667
but is was just a lot smaller than 46 billion light years

114
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,956
now let's go that same distance again from this point

115
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:48,300
space, so let's see let me make it clear this is

116
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,800
380,000 years ago. Now let's fast farword, sorry not

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,000
380,000 ago 380,000 years after the Big Bang

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,333
which is approximately 13.7 billion years ago.

119
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,311
So that's then, now let's look at now, I will just draw it a

120
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:13,867
little it bigger, it's actually going to be much much

121
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:18,787
bigger now, if we do it a little bit bigger so when I

122
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:21,733
draw it like this, this is where we are now this point

123
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,933
in space from which we are only now receiving that

124
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:29,376
cosmic background radiation is over here and then this

125
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:32,933
other point in space is going to be over here, and we

126
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:35,715
saw in the video on the actual size of the observable

127
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:38,600
universe, not just what it appears to be based on how

128
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,133
long the light has been traveling, this is now on the

129
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:44,887
order of 46 or 47 billion light years

130
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,800
so this distance is also going to be

131
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,333
46 billion light years.

132
00:07:55,333 --> 00:08:00,667
Now every point in space back then was emitting this

133
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,267
radiation, we have this uniform radiation, it was

134
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:06,333
just hydrogen atoms everywhere, these hot hydrogen atoms.

135
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,933
Now we're only, maybe I should just do it in the colour

136
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:12,867
of the radiation, I'm just showing you it's coming this guy.

137
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,933
Well only now, 13.7 billion years in the future

138
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:20,133
we're receiving photons from this guy, only now we're

139
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:23,000
receiving it and frankly this green guy only now is

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,133
going to be receiving photons. When he looks at the

141
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,267
points in space when the things that he thinks are

142
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:30,932
the points in space out there, he will see that uniform

143
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:37,133
radiation and likewise this guy over here will only now

144
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,400
be receiving photons from the point in space from

145
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,467
where we are now, he will see the universe where we

146
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:46,600
are now as how it was 380,000 years after the Big Bang

147
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,183
and same thing from that point in space, the photons

148
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:52,200
will only just now reach. Now let's think about it

149
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:01,800
it took this guy's photons 13.7 billion years

150
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,200
to reach this point over here which is now 46 billion

151
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,000
light years away from us and the universe continues

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,533
to expand, depending on the, if the universe expands

153
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:17,133
fast enough there is no way that that photon that got

154
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,800
to this guy will eventually get to this, the universe

155
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,333
is expanding faster that the light can never even

156
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:26,600
catch up to us and this light will never ever get to us

157
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,133
and so there is some threshold, some distance from

158
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:32,400
which will never get light at during this time period

159
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,000
or actually from which we will never ever get any

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,733
electromagnetic radiation, so the simple answer is

161
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:43,467
the cosmic background radiation from this point

162
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:46,667
yes it will start to mature, it won't be as uniform

163
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,867
if we go fast forward 400 million years or billion years

164
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:52,504
but we will get uniform radiation from further out

165
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:54,667
but it will be even more red-shifted and the further

166
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,933
forward we will get into the future the background

167
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:59,467
radiation we get will be from further and further out

168
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,908
and it will be more and more and more red-shifted

169
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:04,800
until some point where it's going to be so red-shifted

170
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,733
we won't even observe it as electromagnetic radiation

171
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,067
and there is some threshold where we won't even

172
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,915
observe anything any more because beyond that

173
00:10:11,915 --> 99:59:59,999
the light wasn't able to actually get to us.
