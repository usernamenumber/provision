1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,707
Factor 8k squared minus 24k minus 144.

2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:10,895
Now the first thing we can do here, just eyeballing each of these terms

3
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:13,742
if we want to simplify it a good bit is

4
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:16,528
all of these terms are divisible by 8.

5
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:19,769
Clearly 8k squared is divisible by 8, 24 is divisible by 8,

6
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,266
and 144, it might not be as obvious is divisble by 8,

7
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:26,801
but it looks like it is. 8 goes into

8
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:32,024
144- 8 goes into 14 one time, 1 times 8 is 8

9
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:35,357
subtract, you get a 6 (14 minus 8 is 6),

10
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:40,083
bring down the four- 8 goes into 64 8 times.

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,846
So it goes into 144 18 times. So let's just

12
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:45,616
factor out an 8 of this, and then that'll simplify

13
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:48,957
our expression, it'll actually give us a leading one coefficient.

14
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:54,102
So this will become 8 times k squared minus

15
00:00:54,102 --> 00:01:04,607
24 divided by 8 is three k minus 18.

16
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,979
Now we have to factor this business in here,

17
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,196
and remember if anything has the form

18
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:14,034
x squared plus bx plus c, where you have a

19
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:17,006
leading one coefficient (this is implicitly a

20
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:18,700
one, we have that here in this expression in

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,915
parentheses), then we literally just need a

22
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,998
(and we can do this multiple ways) but we need

23
00:01:23,998 --> 00:01:27,490
to find two numbers whose sum is equal to the

24
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,063
coefficient on x, so two numbers whose sum is equal

25
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:35,642
to negative three, and whose product is equal

26
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,805
to the constant term, and whose product is

27
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:39,468
equal to negative 18. So let's just think

28
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:44,282
about the factors of -18 here, let's see if we

29
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:47,378
can do something interesting. So it could be

30
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:50,154
one, and since it's negative one of the numbers

31
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:51,783
has to be positive and one has to be negative.

32
00:01:51,783 --> 00:01:55,036
1 and 18 is if it was positive, and one of these

33
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:57,703
could be positive and one could be negative,

34
00:01:57,703 --> 00:01:59,376
but no matter what, we're either going to have

35
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:01,750
pos- we're either- if you, if this is negative

36
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,365
and this is positive, they add up to 17; but

37
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:07,248
if you switch them then they add up to negative 17,

38
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:09,584
so those won't work. So either (you can write

39
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:12,860
it this way) positive or negative 1 and then

40
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,507
negative or positive 18 to show that they

41
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:16,644
have to be different signs. So those don't work.

42
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:20,049
Then you have positive or negative 3 and then

43
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:22,807
negative or positive 6, just to know that they are

44
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,199
different signs. So if you have positive 3 and

45
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,116
negative 6, they add up to negative 3, which

46
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:31,761
is what we need them to add up to. And clearly,

47
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:33,619
they- positive 3 and negative 6 their product

48
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:36,814
is negative 18. So it works! So we're going to go with

49
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:41,044
positive 3 and negative 6 as our two numbers.

50
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:43,663
Now, for this example, just for the sake of this

51
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,392
example, we'll do this by grouping. So what we

52
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:50,345
can do is we can separate this middle term right here

53
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:54,342
as the sum of 3k and -6k, so I can write the

54
00:02:54,342 --> 00:03:00,376
negative 3k as plus 3k minus 6k (let me write the

55
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:04,558
rest of it)- so we have k squared up here, plus 3k

56
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:07,727
minus 6k, which is the same as this thing over here,

57
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:10,654
and we have minus 18. And then all of that's being

58
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:15,944
multiplied by 8. Now we're ready to group this thing-

59
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:18,265
we can group these first two terms, they are both

60
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:23,435
divisible by k, and then we can group these second

61
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:28,266
two terms. So then we have 8 times (let me write

62
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,788
brackets here, since we're using double parentheses

63
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:32,663
- brackets are really just parentheses that look a

64
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:35,637
little bit more serious)- OK, now let's factor

65
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:40,678
out a k from this term right here (using a different

66
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,491
color)- let's factor out the k here. So this is k

67
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:47,673
times k plus 3, and then we have a plus, and over

68
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:51,715
here it looks like we could factor out a negative 6.

69
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:53,628
So let's factor out (let me use a different color)

70
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:55,554
-let's factor out a negative 6 over here. So

71
00:03:55,554 --> 00:04:04,887
plus negative 6 times (k plus 3). So now it looks

72
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:08,188
like we can factor out a k plus 3; there's a k plus 3

73
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:11,339
times a k, and then we have a k plus 3 times the

74
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:16,483
negative 6. So let's factor that out- so we have this 8

75
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:19,432
out front, that's not changing (let me write that and

76
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:22,893
the brackets)- we're factoring out a k plus 3, so then

77
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:27,204
we have a k plus 3 that we factored out, and then inside

78
00:04:27,204 --> 00:04:31,766
of that we just have left this k (instead of writing

79
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:40,096
plus negative 6, I could just write k minus 6).

80
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:42,608
We factor out the k+3 and we're done! And then we

81
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:44,419
can rewrite this- this, the way we wrote it here

82
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:48,148
is 8 times the product of k plus 3 times k minus 6,

83
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:50,770
but we know from the properties of multiplication that

84
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,211
this is the exact same thing as 8 times k plus 3

85
00:04:56,211 --> 00:05:01,008
times k minus 6. And we are done.
