1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:03,004
We're told that the measure of angle QPR..

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:06,921
So QPR, so that's this angle right over here,

3
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:11,172
is 2x + 122 and I'll assume that these are in degrees.

4
00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:16,087
So its 2 x + 122 degrees.

5
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:23,088
And the measure of the angle RPS (that's this angle right over here)

6
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:26,839
is 2 x + 22 degrees.

7
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:30,005
And they ask us to find the measure of angle RPS.

8
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,540
So we need to figure out this right over here.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,171
So we would be able to figure that out

10
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:36,004
if we just knew what x is.

11
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,270
And lucky for us, we can use the information

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,538
given to solve for x.

13
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:42,405
And then figure out what 2 times x plus 22 is.

14
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:45,505
The main big idea here, the thing that pops out here,

15
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,671
is that the outside rays for both of these angles

16
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:52,142
form a line. These 2 angles form line.

17
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:54,754
You could say that they are supplementary

18
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,671
Both of these angles are supplementary.

19
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:02,137
2x+22 plus another 2x+122 is going to add up to 180.

20
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:08,171
We know that this entire angle right over here is 180 degrees.

21
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:15,527
So we can say that the measure of angle QPR (2x+122)

22
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:22,671
PLUS the green angle RPS (2x+22)

23
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:28,420
is going to be equal to 180 degrees.

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,755
And now we can add - we can start simplifying this.

25
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:36,670
We have 2 x's and another 2 x's so those are going to add up to 4 x.

26
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:43,603
And then we have 122 + 22, so that's going to be 144.

27
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,827
The sum of those two are going to be equal to 180 degrees.

28
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:53,912
We can subtract 144 from both sides.

29
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:58,084
On the left hand side, we are just going to be left with a 4x.

30
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,764
This 4x right here.

31
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:02,690
And on the right hand side, we're going to have...

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,633
Let's see, if we were subtracting 140, we would have 40 left.

33
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,669
And then we have to subtract another 4, its going to be 36.

34
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:17,138
Divide both sides by 4, and we get x is equal to 9.

35
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,547
Now, remember, we're not done yet.

36
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:20,013
They didn't say: "solve for x",

37
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:22,363
they said: "find the measure of angle RPS."

38
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:27,937
Which is 2x+22, which is 2 times 9 plus 22.

39
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:32,275
which is 18 + 22 = 40.

40
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:36,275
So the measure of the angle RPS is equal to 40 degrees.
