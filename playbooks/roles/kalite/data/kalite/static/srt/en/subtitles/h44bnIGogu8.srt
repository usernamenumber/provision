2
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:05,217
We're in the MusÃ©e du Louvre,

3
00:00:05,217 --> 00:00:07,350
and we're looking at Michelangelo's "Two Slaves."

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,038
These were originally intended for Pope Julius II's tomb,

5
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:13,752
and they date from 1513 to 1515.

6
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:18,902
So, Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to sculpt his tomb.

7
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:21,406
The original plans were for a very elaborate tomb

8
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:23,436
with more than forty figures;

9
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:27,539
Michelangelo was pulled off to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,633
Then the tomb was redesigned, and there were three figures made for this next version of the tomb:

11
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:37,617
the two slaves that we see here, together with Moses,

12
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:40,779
who is actually on the current version of the tomb,

13
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:44,017
which is in San Pietro in Vinculi in Rome.

14
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:47,434
These two figures were not needed for that final version,

15
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:49,191
and so here they are in the Louvre.

16
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:53,697
Immediately, I start to try to imagine what these figures would look like with the Moses,

17
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:56,507
which is this extraordinarily powerful figure,

18
00:00:56,507 --> 00:01:00,016
but interestingly, is seated, whereas these figures

19
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:02,626
are as ineffectual, and yet they're standing. They're vertical.

20
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:04,962
The figure known as the Dying Slave,

21
00:01:04,962 --> 00:01:07,562
and of course these aren't titles that Michelangelo gave them,

22
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:08,785
- right, they're later attributed titles.

23
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:10,111
- but titles that they acquired -

24
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:14,775
is a very internalized figure. His eyes are closed;

25
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,131
he seems to be in a trance-like state.

26
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:19,487
He seems to be in another place,

27
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:22,299
compared to the figure known as the Bound Slave,

28
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,133
that struggles against the ties that bind him,

29
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:29,433
and seems to look upward toward God.

30
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:32,711
There's a Neoplatonic interpretation of these figures,

31
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:35,632
struggling to be free from the earthly realm,

32
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:37,454
and struggling to be one with God.

33
00:01:37,454 --> 00:01:41,445
He does allow those figures to remain bound to the stone,

34
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:42,454
bound to the rock.

35
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:45,783
And this is a really interesting aspect of Michelangelo's sculpture;

36
00:01:45,783 --> 00:01:48,538
he's willing to allow the raw stone to remain visible.

37
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:52,264
And Michelangelo talked about how, when he looked at a block of marble,

38
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:56,287
he saw a figure struggling to be free from within that marble.

39
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:59,991
The figure of the Bound Slave is bound up in himself,

40
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:03,928
his body is really twisted in a serpentine position

41
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:06,787
that's different from the Dying Slave.

42
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:09,624
It's also that his actual anatomy is heavier.

43
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:12,044
His muscles are larger; he's a more mature figure.

44
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:16,866
That makes that yearning to transcend even more powerful.

45
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:18,783
If you look at the muscles of the arms,

46
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:21,514
they're not as athletically perfect.

47
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:23,708
And his proportions are wider.

48
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,958
They are. And he's actually distorting his own body.

49
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:27,795
Yes.

50
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:29,877
You know, the way that that arm that you mentioned just a moment ago

51
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,793
actually presses against his side,

52
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:34,802
actually sort of pushes it out and creates a kind of distortion -

53
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:38,340
And the face is wider, it's more unfinished.

54
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,869
And the head moves in an almost painful way:

55
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:45,388
up and back, in the opposite way that the shoulders move.

56
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:48,857
And then the shoulders move in the opposite direction of the hips.

57
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:54,113
If you think about how expressive the body becomes under Michelangelo,

58
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:55,616
this is the best example.

59
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,746
Looking at these sculptures for just a moment,

60
00:02:57,746 --> 00:03:01,708
you forget, even though there's raw stone still attached to them,

61
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,719
you begin to forget very quickly that

62
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,773
this is something that was once a block of marble.

63
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:07,461
Yeah.

64
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:16,294
