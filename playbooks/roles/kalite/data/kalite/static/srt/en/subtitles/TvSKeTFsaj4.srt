1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420
   

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,780
We're asked to identify the
percent, amount, and base in

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,640
this problem.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,320
And they ask us, 150 is
25% of what number?

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,650
They don't ask us to solve it,
but it's too tempting.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,800
So what I want to do is first
answer this question that

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,390
they're not even asking
us to solve.

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,140
But first, I want to answer
this question.

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,090
And then we can think about what
the percent, the amount,

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,620
and the base is, because
those are just words.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,680
Those are just definitions.

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,330
The important thing is
to be able to solve a

13
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,620
problem like this.

14
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:36,640
So they're saying 150 is
25% of what number?

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,030
Or another way to view this,
150 is 25% of some number.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:52,690
So let's let x, x is equal
to the number that

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,080
150 is 25% of, right?

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,150
That's what we need
to figure out.

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,470
150 is 25% of what number?

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,920
That number right here
we're seeing is x.

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,270
So that tells us that if we
start with x, and if we were

22
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:16,790
to take 25% of x, you could
imagine, that's the same thing

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,500
as multiplying it by 25%, which
is the same thing as

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,420
multiplying it, if you
view it as a decimal,

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,920
times 0.25 times x.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,230
These two statements
are identical.

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,290
So if you start with that
number, you take 25% of it, or

28
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:41,870
you multiply it by 0.25, that
is going to be equal to 150.

29
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,780
150 is 25% of this number.

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,760
And then you can solve for x.

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,280
So let's just start with
this one over here.

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,110
Let me just write it separately,
so you understand

33
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,780
what I'm doing.

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,190
0.25 times some number
is equal to 150.

35
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,910
Now there's two ways
we can do this.

36
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,780
We can divide both sides of this
equation by 0.25, or if

37
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,930
you recognize that four quarters
make a dollar, you

38
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,230
could say, let's multiply both
sides of this equation by 4.

39
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,200
You could do either one.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,550
I'll do the first, because
that's how we normally do

41
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,370
algebra problems like this.

42
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:28,590
So let's just multiply
both by 0.25.

43
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,050
That will just be an x.

44
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:35,040
And then the right-hand side
will be 150 divided by 0.25.

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,790
And the reason why I wanted to
is really it's just good

46
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,420
practice dividing
by a decimal.

47
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,620
So let's do that.

48
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:46,090
So we want to figure out what
150 divided by 0.25 is.

49
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,610
And we've done this before.

50
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,590
When you divide by a decimal,
what you can do is you can

51
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,950
make the number that you're
dividing into the other

52
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,660
number, you can turn this into
a whole number by essentially

53
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,980
shifting the decimal
two to the right.

54
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,715
But if you do that for the
number in the denominator, you

55
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:00,700
also have to do that
to the numerator.

56
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,150
So right now you can view
this as 150.00.

57
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,360
If you multiply 0.25 times
100, you're shifting the

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,070
decimal two to the right.

59
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,220
Then you'd also have to do
that with 150, so then it

60
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,290
becomes 15,000.

61
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,250
Shift it two to the right.

62
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,470
So our decimal place
becomes like this.

63
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,510
So 150 divided by 0.25
is the same thing as

64
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,840
15,000 divided by 25.

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,520
And let's just work it
out really fast.

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,960
So 25 doesn't go into 1, doesn't
go into 15, it goes

67
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,650
into 150, what is that?

68
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,020
Six times, right?

69
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,890
If it goes into 100 four
times, then it goes

70
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,290
into 150 six times.

71
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,290
6 times 0.25 is-- or actually,
this is now a 25.

72
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,170
We've shifted the decimal.

73
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,920
This decimal is sitting
right over there.

74
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,990
So 6 times 25 is 150.

75
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,190
You subtract.

76
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,270
You get no remainder.

77
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,390
Bring down this 0 right here.

78
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,180
25 goes into 0 zero times.

79
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,990
0 times 25 is 0.

80
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,810
Subtract.

81
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,640
No remainder.

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,620
Bring down this last 0.

83
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,140
25 goes into 0 zero times.

84
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,710
0 times 25 is 0.

85
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,440
Subtract.

86
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
No remainder.

87
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,840
So 150 divided by 0.25
is equal to 600.

88
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,470
And you might have been able
to do that in your head,

89
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,220
because when we were at this
point in our equation, 0.25x

90
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,790
is equal to 150, you could
have just multiplied both

91
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,750
sides of this equation
times 4.

92
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,170
4 times 0.25 is the same
thing as 4 times

93
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,190
1/4, which is a whole.

94
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,860
And 4 times 150 is 600.

95
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,790
So you would have gotten
it either way.

96
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,390
And this makes total sense.

97
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,710
If 150 is 25% of some number,
that means 150 should be 1/4

98
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,310
of that number.

99
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,690
It should be a lot smaller than
that number, and it is.

100
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,710
150 is 1/4 of 600.

101
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,070
Now let's answer their
actual question.

102
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,950
Identify the percent.

103
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,800
Well, that looks like 25%,
that's the percent.

104
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,820
The amount and the base
in this problem.

105
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,990
And based on how they're wording
it, I assume amount

106
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,330
means when you take the 25% of
the base, so they're saying

107
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,335
that the amount-- as my best
sense of it-- is that the

108
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:24,540
amount is equal to the percent
times the base.

109
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,130
Let me do the base in green.

110
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,410
So the base is the number you're
taking the percent of.

111
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,650
The amount is the quantity
that that percentage

112
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,610
represents.

113
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:39,670
So here we already saw
the percent is 25%.

114
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,960
That's the percent.

115
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:52,910
The number that we're taking
25% of, or the base, is x.

116
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,620
The value of it is 600.

117
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,680
We figured it out.

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,180
And the amount is 150.

119
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,980
This right here is the amount.

120
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,350
The amount is 150.

121
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,630
150 is 25% of the
base, of 600.

122
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,610
The important thing is how
you solve this problem.

123
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,950
The words themselves, you know,
those are all really

124
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,460
just definitions.

125
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,199
