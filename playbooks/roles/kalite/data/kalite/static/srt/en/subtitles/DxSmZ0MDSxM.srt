00:00:00,502 --> 00:00:05,667
Solve using the elimination method and they tell us the sum of two numbers is 70

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:12,267
Their difference is 24. What are the two numbers? So let's use this first sentence. Let's construct an equation from

3
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:17,000
this first sentence. Lets construct an constraint. The sum of two numbers, lets call them x and y.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,133
So their sum, x + y is equal to 70. That's what this first sentence tells us.

5
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:30,133
The second sentence tells us their difference is 24. So that means that x minus y is equal

6
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:35,533
to 24. We're going to assume that x is the larger of the two numbers and y is the smaller one.

7
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:39,800
So when you take a difference like this you get a positive 24. So you have system of two

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,133
equations with two unknowns and they want us to solve it using the elimination method so let's

9
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:51,467
do that. So we can literally just add these two questions. On the left side we would have a positive

10
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:56,733
y and a negative y over here, and they would just cancel out. So if we were to just add these equations, they would

11
00:00:56,733 --> 00:01:01,933
cancel out, so if we were able to just add these two equations we would be able to eliminate

12
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:04,400
the y's. So lets do that. So (x plus y) plus (x minus y). Well the plus y and the minus y

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,867
cancel out and you're left with x plus an x which is 2x. And that is going to be equal to 70 plus

14
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:17,267
24. 70 plus 24 is equal to 94. And I want to make it clear. I mentioned it in previous videos.

15
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:21,933
That this process of adding equations to each other. This is nothing new, we're really just

16
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:28,733
adding the same thing to both side of this equation. You could say we're adding 24 to both sides of t

17
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:32,800
this equation. Over here we're explicitly adding 24 to the 70. And over here you could say

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,533
we could add 24 to x plus y. But the second constraint tells us that x minus y is the same thing

19
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:43,400
as 24. So we're adding the same thing to both sides. Here we're calling it 24, here we're calling it

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:50,467
x minus y. And we were able to eliminate the y. So we get 2x is equal to 94 now we can divide both sides

21
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:58,333
by 2. And we are left with x is equal to 47.

22
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:03,067
And now we can substitute back into either one of these equations to solve for y.

23
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:08,800
So let's try this first one over here. So we have 47 plus y is equal to

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,400
70. We can subtract 47 from both sides of this equation. So we subtract 47 and we are left with

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:25,267
y is equal to 23. And you can verify that this works. If you add the two numbers

26
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:33,746
47 plus 23 you definitely get 70. If you take 47 minus 23 you definitely get 24.

27
00:02:33,746 --> 99:59:59,999
So it definitely meets both constraints.
