1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,933
Let's say I'm walking along some trail and there's some trees on the side of the road,

2
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:10,133
and let's just say that these are some plants and these are the barks of the trees,

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,667
and maybe I should do it in brown, but you get the idea.

4
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:14,533
These are some plants that are along the side of the road,

5
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,600
or at least the stem of the plant or the bark of the tree.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,533
And in the background I have some mountains,

7
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,667
maybe those mountains are several miles away,

8
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,800
and so I have some mountains in the background.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,067
We know just from experience that if I'm walking

10
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:29,333
(let me draw myself over here)

11
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:33,467
we know that if I'm walking this way,

12
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,933
the trees look like they're going past me much faster,

13
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:39,533
much faster than the mountains.

14
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:42,200
Like if I'm going past just one tree after another then

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,467
they'll just whiz pasts me, maybe if I'm running

16
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:47,800
but the mountains don't seem to be moving that quickly

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,467
And this idea that if you change your position,

18
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:54,667
the things that are closer to you seem to move more

19
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,867
than the things that are further than you

20
00:00:56,867 --> 00:01:02,867
This idea, or this, I guess, this property, is called parallax.

21
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:04,800
And what we're going to do

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,933
in this video, and maybe it's especially obvious if

23
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,867
you're driving in a car, then the things closer to you

24
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,600
are whizzing by you, maybe the curb of the street

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,800
or whatever, while the things that are further away

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,600
don't seem to be whizzing by as fast

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,467
What I want to do in this video is think about how

28
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:22,000
we can use parallax to figure out how far certain stars are.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,467
And what I want to emphasize, is that

30
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:26,200
this method is only good for relatively close stars.

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,267
We don't have instruments sensitive enough yet

32
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:33,333
to use parallax to measure stars that are really, really, far away

33
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,600
But to think about how this is done, how we use

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,933
stellar parallax (so let me write stellar up here)

35
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,667
How we use stellar parallax, the parallax of stars

36
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,733
to figure out how far away they are

37
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:46,267
Let's think a little bit about our solar system

38
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:51,133
So here is our Sun in the solar system

39
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:55,000
And here is Earth at one point in the year

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,600
And what I want to do is, and let's just say that

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,867
this is the north pole kind of popping out of the screen right here

42
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:04,467
and so the Earth is rotating in that direction

43
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:07,400
And I also want to think about the star that is

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
obviously outside of our solar system

45
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,667
and I'm really underestimating the distance to this star

46
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,600
As we'll see, or as you might already know

47
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,933
the distance to the nearest star from our solar system

48
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:25,933
is 250,000 times the distance between the earth and the sun

49
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,800
So if I wanted to draw this to scale, first of all

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,667
the Earth would be this unnoticeable dot here,

51
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,867
but you would also, whatever this distance is

52
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:36,467
you would have to multiply this by 250,000 to get

53
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:38,867
the distance to this nearest star.

54
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,267
Anyway, with that said, let's think about what

55
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:45,533
that star would look like from the surface of the Earth.

56
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:48,200
So let me pick a point on the surface, maybe we're

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,867
talking about North America, or right there in the

58
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:51,800
Northern Hemisphere.

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,000
So let's take that little patch of land, and think about

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,467
how the position of that star would look.

61
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,000
So that's the patch of land, maybe this is my house

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
right over here, jutting out the side of the Earth

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,267
maybe this is me standing, I'm drawing everything sideways

64
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,867
because I'm trying to hold this perspective, so

65
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:12,000
this is me looking up.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And, let's say at this point in time, the way I've drawn

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,600
this patch, the Sun will just be coming over the horizon.

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,400
So the Sun, this is essentially at sunrise. So let me

69
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,600
do my best to drawing the Sun from my point of view.

70
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,000
It looks like, remember the Earth is rotating in this way

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,333
it's rotating, the way I've drawn it, it's rotating counterclockwise.

72
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,133
But from the surface of the Earth, it would like the

73
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,533
Sun is coming up here, it's rising in the East.

74
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:43,333
But right at that dawn, on this day, when the Earth

75
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,733
is right over here, what would that star look like?

76
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:50,333
Well the star, so if we look at this version of the Earth

77
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:55,533
these stars are kind of skewed a little bit.

78
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,267
Not straight up, straight up would be this direction

79
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:00,867
from the point of view of my house. It is now skewed

80
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,467
a little bit closer to the Sun, so if you go in this

81
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,800
zoomed in version, straight up would look something

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,333
like that. And maybe, based on my measurement, it

83
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:16,133
would look like the star is right over there. So it's

84
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:19,267
a little bit skewed towards where the Sun is rising,

85
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:23,133
towards the East, relative to straight up. Now, let's

86
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:26,133
fast forward six months, so that the Earth is on the

87
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,600
other side of its orbit from the Sun. So let's fast

88
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,600
forward six months. We're over here, and let's wait

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,800
for a time of day, where we are essentially, that

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,000
little patch of the Earth is pointed in the same direction

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,333
at least in our galaxy, maybe. So it's pointing in the

92
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,800
same direction, and if you think about it, if we go back

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,600
to this patch of Earth, now the Earth is still rotating

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,467
on that direction, but now the Sun is on the West, the

95
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:59,800
Sun is going to be right over here, maybe I'll do it

96
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,533
like this, just to make it clear. I'll draw this side

97
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,600
of the Sun with this greenish color, obviously the Sun

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,133
is not green, but it'll make clear that the sun is going

99
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:13,600
to be over here. The patch is going to be turning away

100
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,133
from the Sun, so it'll look to that observer on Earth like

101
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:20,133
the Sun is setting, so it will look like the Sun is going

102
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:23,600
down over the horizon. But the important thing is, once

103
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,267
we're at this point in the year, what will that star

104
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:29,600
look like? Well if we have this large diagram, we see

105
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,867
that the star is now, relative to straight up, a little

106
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:40,267
bit to the West now, a little bit more now on the side

107
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:45,000
of that setting sun. So the star would now look like

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,133
it's right there. And if we have good enough instruments,

109
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:54,867
we can measure the angle between where the star was

110
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:59,200
six months ago, and where it is now. And let's call

111
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,267
that angle, well I'll call that angle, two times theta.

112
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,333
And the reason why I call it two times theta, we could

113
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,333
call that angle relative, we could call theta the angle

114
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:12,800
between the star and being straight up. So this would

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,667
be theta, and that would be theta. And I care about that,

116
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,533
because if I know theta, and if I know the distance from

117
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:22,867
the Earth to the Sun, I can then use a little bit of

118
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:26,133
trigonometry to figure out the distance to that star

119
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,333
Because if you think about it, this theta right over

120
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,533
here is the same as this angle. So if this is straight up

121
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:34,667
that is looking straight up into the night sky, this

122
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:38,600
would be the angle theta. If you know that angle,

123
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,867
from basic trigonometry, or even basic geometry, if

124
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:45,467
you say this is a right angle right over here, this

125
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:51,533
would be 90 minus theta. And then you could use some

126
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:55,667
basic trigonometry. If you know this distance right

127
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:59,000
here, and you're trying to figure out this distance

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,533
the distance to that nearest star. So this is what we're

129
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:04,667
trying to figure out. We could say, "Look, we need

130
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,533
a trigonometric function that deals with the opposite

131
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:10,200
angle, the opposite angle of what we know (we know

132
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,333
this thing right over here) and the adjacent angle

133
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,867
(we already know this thing right over here). So let

134
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:20,467
me call this the Earth-Sun distance, or let me just

135
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:25,733
call this d. And we want to figure out x. So with some

136
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:28,267
basic trigonometry, and you might want to do this if

137
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,267
you forget the basic trigonometric function.

138
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:35,933
SOH CAH TOA. Sin is opposite over hypotenuse,

139
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:40,000
cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, tangent is opposite

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,800
over adjacent. So the tangent function deals with the

141
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,200
two sides of this right triangle that we can now deal with.

142
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:54,933
So we can say that the tangent of 90 minus theta, this

143
00:07:54,933 --> 00:08:01,067
angle right over here, tangent of that angle right over here,

144
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:06,333
Let me write it over here, tangent of ninety minus theta,

145
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,200
that angle right over there, is equal to the opposite

146
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:16,133
side, is equal to x, over the adjacent side, over "d".

147
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,000
Or another way, if you assumed that we know

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,267
the distance to the sun you multiply both side times that distance,

149
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:28,467
you get "d" times the tangent of ninety minus theta is equal

150
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:32,733
to "x". And you can figure out the distance from our

151
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:36,600
solar system to that star. Now I want to make it very,

152
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
very, very clear. These are huge distances. I did not

153
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,333
draw this to scale. The distance to the nearest star

154
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:48,533
is actually 250,000 times the distance to our sun.

155
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:52,867
So this angle is going to be super, super, super super small.

156
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,933
So you need yo have very good instruments even to

157
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:58,600
measure, even to observe the stellar parallax to the nearest

158
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,133
stars. And we're constantly launching, or having better

159
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,867
instruments, and actually the Europeans right now are

160
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:08,133
in the process of a mission called GAIA to measure these

161
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:11,000
with enough accuracy that we can start to measure the

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,800
accurate distance to stars several tens of thousands of

163
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,267
light years away. So that'll start to get us a very

164
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:21,667
accurate map of a significant chunk of our galaxy, which

165
00:09:21,667 --> 99:59:59,999
is about a hundred thousand light years in diameter.
