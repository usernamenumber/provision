1
00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:01,887
Now that we have a decent understanding of

2
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:05,095
how to figure out many significant figures that we are dealing with

3
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:07,862
lets take a situation where,

4
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:11,881
significant figures will or might become relevant.

5
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:14,482
So let's say that I have a carpet here

6
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:21,100
and I'm using a may be a meter stick to measure the carpet to nearest centimeter.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:28,726
And so I get the carpet as on to the the nearest centimeter I get to be 1.69 meters.

8
00:00:28,726 --> 00:00:32,623
So this is 9, obiviously this is to the nearest centimeter.

9
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:37,555
This 9 hundredths of a meter as the same thing as 9 centimeters.

10
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:44,738
And let's say I'm able to measure the width here as 2.09 meters.

11
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:47,457
I use the same meter stick and you were to ask me:

12
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:50,951
"Sal, what is the area of your carpet?"

13
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,380
So - you know - just to the straight up calculation:

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,219
the area is going to be the length times the width,

15
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,799
so it would be 1.69 meters times 2.09 meters.

16
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,681
We could do this by hand, but let me just get the calculator out

17
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,470
to make things move along a little bit faster.

18
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:21,354
And so we have 1.69 times 2.09 and they gives us 3.5321.

19
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:26,964
Let me write that down 3.5321.

20
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:32,881
So let me write this in a new color. So this gives us 3.5321,

21
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:37,548
and we have a meters times a meters which gives us meters squared or square meters.

22
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:39,861
I might very proudly to tell you that

23
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:44,581
"Hey the area is 3.5321 square meters.

24
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:49,160
And the problem here is that it when I give you this thing

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,744
that has all of these numbers behind the decimal point

26
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,833
and all of these are significant figures

27
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:58,828
that implies that I had a really precise way of measuring the area.

28
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,979
But in reality I only was able to measure the area to the nearest centimeter.

29
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,289
So the way we would do this we don't...

30
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:10,215
so I don't make it look like my measurement is more precise than it really is.

31
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:13,258
So this calculation is derived from my measurements.

32
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:20,023
I make sure that it has no more significant figures then either of the numbers that I multiplied.

33
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:25,651
So in this situation I have 3 significant figures here,

34
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:31,276
and over here I have 3 significant figures.

35
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:36,315
And so in general you multiply or devide the significant figures in your product

36
00:02:36,315 --> 00:02:50,215
or the divisor, divident, the quotient , the quotient!

37
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:57,120
The numbers, the significant figures in your product or your quotient can not be any more than

38
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,467
the least number of significant digits,

39
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:01,067
or whatever you are using to come up with that product quotient.

40
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:04,297
So over here both of these have 3 significant figures.

41
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:08,605
So I can only have 3 significant figures in my product.

42
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,697
If one of these had 3 significant figures and this have 2 significant figures,

43
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:15,459
I can have only have 2 significant figures in my product.

44
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,308
So in order to be kind of legit here,

45
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:21,302
I have to round this to 3 significant figures.

46
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,506
I have to round it to 3 significant figures,

47
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:27,436
I need to round it to the nearest hundredth here

48
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:30,969
and so this 2 will round down, so we got

49
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:38,705
this gets us to 3.53 meters squared.

50
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:41,044
Now we're cool with the significant figures.

51
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:44,500
Let's do another situation with division!

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,574
Let's say that I'm...

53
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:48,767
Let's say that I'm laying tiles down in my bathroom,

54
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:50,569
and so the diagram will look very similar,

55
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:55,505
and I measure... I measure the...

56
00:03:55,505 --> 00:04:00,636
I measure the width of my bathroom to be,

57
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:09,108
let's say it is 10.1 feet now. 10.1 feet.

58
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:11,544
And this is the precision that I'm able to measure.

59
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,302
So I'm able to measure the 10th of a foot.

60
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:19,700
And let's say that the length of my floor is ...

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:26,103
The length of my floor - I just make up a number - is 12 point...

62
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:30,038
And for whatever reason I was able to measure this with slightly higher precision

63
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:34,701
So 12.07 feet. And let's say...

64
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:39,237
Let's say that I have tiles... I have tiles.

65
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:46,836
And the tile has an area, so someone else measure for me, it has an area of...

66
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:54,970
Let's say that the area of this tile is 1.07 feet squared.

67
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:02,872
What I want to do is to figure out how many tiles can fit on this bathroom floor.

68
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:07,452
So what I would do I would figure out the area of this bathroom floor,

69
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:10,242
and then divide by the area of the tiles.

70
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:14,454
So the area of the bathroom floor, so floor area...

71
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:25,569
Floor area is going to be equal to 10.1 feet times 12.07 feet,

72
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:31,836
so that will give us, let's calculate it.

73
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:42,406
It is 10.1 times 12.07 feet, it gives a 121.907.

74
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:46,372
So this equal to - let's scroll over a little bit to the right -

75
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:49,380
this is equal to - a little bit more over the right -

76
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:56,549
this is equal to 121.907 feet squared, or squared feet.

77
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:59,132
Now, we are not done with our calculation,

78
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:00,714
but there might be a temptation right here,

79
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:03,308
say look, I have 4 significant figures here,

80
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:05,628
I have 3 significant figures over here,

81
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:07,569
there would be a temptation to say,

82
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,833
"Look, my area should not have more then 3 significant figures."

83
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:14,903
And that temptation would be OK, if this is all you are looking for.

84
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:18,464
If the final answer you are looking for was the area of the floor.

85
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,842
But we are not done with our calculation,

86
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:25,381
we want to figure out how many of these tiles will fit into this area.

87
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:27,214
So the general rule of thumb,

88
00:06:27,214 --> 00:06:29,235
because you don't want to loose information,

89
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:31,434
the general thumb is:

90
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:35,378
don't round the significant figures until you are done with the calculation.

91
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:39,698
Especially if you are just doing a bunch of multiplying and dividing

92
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,842
because otherwise if you round here,

93
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:45,636
you actually will introduce more error into your calculation than you'd want to.

94
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:47,988
So what you do is you keep it as kind of a full number.

95
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:51,287
Now you do the division. So let's do the division.

96
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:56,253
So the tiles per floor... tiles per floor.

97
00:06:56,253 --> 00:07:00,789
I guess we could say my bathroom or tiles in the bathroom,

98
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:06,406
tiles fitting in bathroom, on the floor of this bathroom.

99
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:12,502
It would be the area of the bathroom, so 121.907 feet squared,

100
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:14,435
divided by the area of the tile,

101
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:19,002
divided by 1.07 feet squared.

102
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:21,307
And ones again, let me get the calculator out.

103
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:29,767
So we have 121.907 divided by 1.07,

104
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,701
and you get this crazy thing with all of these digits,

105
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,497
but this is going to be our final answer,

106
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,899
so here we do care about significant figures.

107
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:38,835
So tiles fitting in the bathroom,

108
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:41,010
we get something that is actually just keeps going,

109
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,090
so it's... Let me write this in a new color.

110
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:52,175
We got 113.931775701 - and actually it just keeps going - feet squared.

111
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:53,567
And this is the final answer.

112
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:57,100
We cared about how many tiles will fit onto this bathroom floor,

113
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,508
now the significant figures come into play.

114
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:01,342
And the way to think about this:

115
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:06,837
I have 4 significant figures over here, I have 2 significant figures here,

116
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:09,300
I have 3 significant figures over here,

117
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,166
and since we did just a bunch of multiplying and dividing, in general...

118
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:17,258
Since we did a bunch of multiplying and dividing we have to have the minimum,

119
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:20,774
whatever is the minimum significant figures of the things we computed with,

120
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:23,923
that's how many significant figures we can have in our final answer.

121
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:28,434
We'll make this clear: this has 2 significant figures, but this is 3: the 1, the 0 and the 1.

122
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:32,170
So our final answer can only the 3 significant figures.

123
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,034
3 significant figures.

124
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:40,844
So we need to round to the nearest foot. The next digit over is a 9, so we need to round up.

125
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:42,422
So we are going to round up.

126
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:48,767
So this would get us to 114. Actually this units aren't squared feet, this is in tiles.

127
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:56,432
This is feet divided by feet, and so this is going to be 114, 114 tiles.

128
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:59,031
Obviously it is not going to be exactly 114 tiles,

129
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:03,172
but based on the precision of the measurements we have done,

130
00:09:03,172 --> 00:09:05,031
we can say 114 tiles.

131
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:09,305
Now what I have just showed you right here what we multiply and divide measurements

132
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:11,367
that has a certain number of significant figures.

133
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:15,434
The general rule of thumb is whatever the minimum number of significant figures

134
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:18,502
in any of the numbers calculated, that is how many significant figures...

135
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:21,505
that is the least number is the number of significant figure

136
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:23,767
in your final quotient or product or answer.

137
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:29,921
When you do addition and subtraction, it's a little bit different and we will cover that in the next video.
