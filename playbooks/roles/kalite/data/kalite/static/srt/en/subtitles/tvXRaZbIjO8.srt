1
00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:04,933
We're asked to subtract, and we have the complex number two minus three i,

2
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:09,533
and from that, we are subtracting six minus eighteen i.

3
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:13,332
So, the first thing I'd like to do here is to just kind of get rid of these parentheses.

4
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:18,190
So we just have a bunch of real parts and imaginary parts that we can then add up together.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:23,867
So we have two minus three i and then we're subtracting this entire quantity,

6
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:27,102
and to get rid of the parentheses, we can just distribute the negative sign,

7
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:31,067
or, another way to think about it, we can say that this is negative one times all of this.

8
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:39,129
So we can just distribute the negative sign and negative one times six is negative six--let me do these in magenta--

9
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:41,533
so this is negative six,

10
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:45,952
and then negative one times negative eighteen i, well that's just going to be positive,

11
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:50,133
positive eighteen i: negative times a negative is a positive.

12
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:54,533
And now we want to add the real parts and we want to add the imaginary parts,

13
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:58,800
so here is a real part here: two, and then we have a minus six,

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,933
so we have two minus six,

15
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,841
and we want to add the imaginary parts.

16
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:05,759
We have a negative--let me do that in a different color--

17
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:11,902
we have a negative three i right over here, so negative three i (or "minus three i")

18
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:14,267
right over there, and then we have a plus eighteen i

19
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:19,000
or positive eighteen i, so then we have a positive eighteen i.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,133
If you add the real parts: two minus six is negative four.

21
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:29,200
And you imag-- add the--add the imaginary parts: if I have negative three of something,

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,400
and to that I add eighteen of something,

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,133
well, that's just going to leave me with fifteen of that something.

24
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,200
Or another way you can think about it:

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,933
if I have eighteen of something and I subtract three of that something,

26
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,795
I'll have fifteen of that something.

27
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:44,400
In this case, that "something" is the imag-- is i, the imaginary unit,

28
00:01:44,400 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is, so this is going to be plus fifteen--plus fifteen i--and we are done.
