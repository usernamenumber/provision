1
00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:03,020
Where we left off in the last series of videos,

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:13,050
we had the Chinese Central Bank that was trying to make sure

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,080
that the yuan does not appreciate too much.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,016
So the way they did that is that they bought up all of the excess dollars

5
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,181
using yuan that they printed.

6
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:29,491
So what they do is, they print yuan

7
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:32,532
-- I'll do the yuan in this blue color--

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:40,035
so they print yuan,

9
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:44,032
and then they use that printed yuan to buy dollars in the open market.

10
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,035
And what that does is it props up the demand for dollars

11
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:51,036
and keeps the price of yuan down, so then they get dollars.

12
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:59,990
So they print yuan and they buy dollars.

13
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:03,009
And as we saw, they have to keep doing this

14
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:08,078
in order to keep the yuan deflated,

15
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:11,162
or in order to keep the dollar inflated.

16
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:13,009
And this is so that they can maintain

17
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:15,192
a favorable balance of trade.

18
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:16,283
But as they do this,

19
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:22,339
they're just building the stockpile of dollar reserves.

20
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:24,062
And as we mentioned in the last video,

21
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:27,051
they're not just keeping a big vault of dollar bills there.

22
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:29,614
They're going to use it to buy assets,

23
00:01:29,614 --> 00:01:32,258
and they're going to buy liquid and safe assets.

24
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:36,403
And the main asset they're going to buy is U.S. Treasury bills.

25
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:41,028
So then they take these dollars and they buy U.S.Treasury bills.

26
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,955
And let me draw some of the other actors here,

27
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:45,692
because they can buy it from two separate people.

28
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:49,579
There is the United States government.

29
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,289
So there is the U.S. Treasury.

30
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,062
They are going to issue Treasury bills,

31
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,121
when they essentially just need to borrow money.

32
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:01,918
And then there's other people that have already bought Treasury bills.

33
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,875
So let me draw them over here.

34
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,985
So then there are other people who own Treasury bills.

35
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:09,739
So this is someone who owns a Treasury bill right over here,

36
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,250
wearing a hat, maybe with a little bit of hair and a moustache.

37
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,566
So this is someone who owns a Treasury bill.

38
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:17,492
So just to give a review,

39
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:21,533
when the U.S. government wants to borrow money,

40
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:27,731
people hand the U.S. government money

41
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,826
-- I'll draw it as a dollar bill, right over there--

42
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:33,230
they hand the U.S. Treasury money,

43
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,225
and then the U.S. Treasury gives them an IOU.

44
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:45,068
This IOU is what a Treasury bill is,

45
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:48,024
and what it entitles the holder of this piece of paper,

46
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:51,006
it allows them to get interest from the Treasury,

47
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,024
depending on what type of Treasury bill or bond it will be.

48
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,630
It'll be over a certain period of time.

49
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,087
I have a whole video on this,

50
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:58,024
especially the ones where I talk about the yield curve.

51
00:02:58,024 --> 00:03:00,090
And then at some future date, the U.S. Treasury is going to

52
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,019
pay them a larger amount of money than they put back in.

53
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:13,003
So this right here is a Treasury bond or bill.

54
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:15,062
T-bill if it's a shorter duration,

55
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,031
Treasury bond if it's a longer duration.

56
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,277
This is a Treasury bond.

57
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:22,021
It is a loan to the U.S. Treasury.

58
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:24,044
Now, the Chinese Central Bank,

59
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:25,967
they have all these excess dollars.

60
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,018
They can buy treasuries from either two sources.

61
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:32,463
When the U.S. Treasury itself needs to raise funds,

62
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,994
it will essentially put these IOUs for auction.

63
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:41,151
It will sell them to whoever is willing to take them for the least interest.

64
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:43,059
So let me put it this way,

65
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:45,181
so what they can do is

66
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:48,034
they can give the money directly to the U.S. Treasury,

67
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:50,701
when the U.S. Treasury puts Treasury bills

68
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:52,945
or Treasury bonds up for auction.

69
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:55,666
So it can give the money directly to the U.S. Treasury,

70
00:03:55,666 --> 00:04:04,123
and then the U.S. Treasury will give them one of these IOUs,

71
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:11,582
or it could buy it from someone already has it out in the open market.

72
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:14,009
This is a very deep, very, very liquid open market.

73
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:17,043
Or they can give these people right over here money,

74
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:22,008
and then they would transfer the IOU over to this Central Bank.

75
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:25,067
So what is happening at the Central Bank?

76
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:28,108
What is essentially happening here?

77
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:29,504
What's essentially happening is

78
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:33,630
the Chinese Central Bank printing money to buy dollars

79
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,172
that it will then essentially lend to the U.S. Treasury.

80
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:41,011
So it looks kind of convoluted,

81
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:43,226
but the essence of what is happening here

82
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:46,287
is that the Chinese government,

83
00:04:46,287 --> 00:05:01,962
you have the Chinese Central Bank lending to U.S. government.

84
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:04,037
And it might be buying other assets,

85
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,028
but the Treasury bonds and bills are

86
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:08,045
really the main form of liquid asset they might be buying.

87
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:11,023
So how does this affect the United States,

88
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:15,918
other than the fact that instead of owing other investors these IOUs,

89
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:17,341
It now owes it to the Chinese?

90
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:19,952
But what is the net effect of having this player out here,

91
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,933
having this very significant player out there,

92
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,887
that is fairly aggressively willing

93
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:30,162
to pay for U.S. government IOUs, U.S. treasuries?

94
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:31,716
What is the effect of that?

95
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:34,069
Well, we saw in the yield curve video

96
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:36,089
that the more people willing to give you a loan,

97
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:37,777
the lower the interest rates are going to be.

98
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:40,749
And I can show you a very simple example of that.

99
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:44,872
If I'm looking to borrow！and I'm no longer talking about nations,

100
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:47,267
I'm just talking about Sal now--

101
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:52,200
let's say that I'm over here,

102
00:05:52,200 --> 00:06:02,558
and I'm looking to borrow $10.

103
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:05,742
And I say, hey, who's willing to give me the best deal on $10,

104
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:07,473
and I'm going to pay you back next week.

105
00:06:07,473 --> 00:06:12,689
So you might come along and say,

106
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:16,012
I'll lend it to you for 10% interest over a week.

107
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:26,304
So you can pay me $11 next week.

108
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,630
So this would essentially be 10% interest over the week.

109
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,092
You give me $10 now, and if I agree to you,

110
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:34,364
then I'll give you $11 in a week.

111
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:35,802
That would be 10% interest.

112
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:38,088
But then let's say Mary comes along.

113
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:41,709
And she says, oh, I can do better than Mr. Orange Guy over there.

114
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:47,512
This is Mary. I can do better than Mr. Orange Guy over there.

115
00:06:47,512 --> 00:07:00,693
I'll lend you $10, and you can pay me $10.50 next week.

116
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:02,085
So notice what happened.

117
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:03,862
Both of these people have $10 to lend.

118
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:06,977
They're looking to get some return on their $10.

119
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:09,031
If he was the only player here,

120
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:10,161
I'd have to go to him and say,

121
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:11,400
OK I'm going to pay you 10% interest.

122
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,056
Then she says, no, no, no, I also have $10 and,

123
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:16,792
gee, I'd be happy with just a 5% return.

124
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:20,413
$0.50 off of my $10 in one week, that's a good return.

125
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:22,129
So right now, look at this person.

126
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,016
But the more money that's available to borrow,

127
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:27,074
the more competitive this side of the equation is going to be,

128
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:30,293
and the lower the interest rate I can get.

129
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:33,335
You can imagine even a third person says,

130
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:37,261
no, no, no, wait! I've got $10.

131
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:39,947
Let me draw this third person, who says,

132
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:42,401
I have $10, and you know what?

133
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,270
It's going to just be sitting in my bank account doing nothing

134
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,731
unless I lend it to you.

135
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:53,149
You can pay me, I don't know, $10.25 next week.

136
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:54,772
And then I'm going to go to this person.

137
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:57,496
So the larger than the number of people willing to lend to me,

138
00:07:57,496 --> 00:08:00,680
the lower my interest rate will be.

139
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,031
Or another way you could think of it,

140
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:17,424
the larger the supply of money to be lent, that leads to lower--

141
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:19,939
you can view it different ways.

142
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:26,027
You could view it as lower borrowing costs,

143
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:31,027
which is another way of just saying lower interest.

144
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,115
Or you can even view it as cheaper money.

145
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:35,009
It costs less to borrow the money.

146
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:40,774
The cost of borrowing money is the interest. Lower interest.

147
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:41,998
Now, what does that do?

148
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:43,344
What does having lower interest?

149
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:47,664
So this is just a small example with me trying to borrow $10.

150
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:49,941
The more people there are, the more competitive that is,

151
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:51,096
the better interest rate I'll have.

152
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:54,705
So you just take that same notion to kind of a macro level.

153
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:57,888
The U.S. government is constantly borrowing money.

154
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:00,011
The more people out there willing to give it money,

155
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:03,022
willing to buy the U.S. government's IOUs,

156
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:04,998
the lower the interest rate will be.

157
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:11,653
So the net effect of having this major buyer of U.S. Treasuries

158
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:15,555
is that having them out there accumulating all of these dollars,

159
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,386
taking them all out of the foreign exchange markets

160
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:20,071
and then using them to buy treasuries,

161
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:23,604
it lowers the interest rate for treasuries.

162
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,976
So the net effect is

163
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:36,264
the U.S. Treasury has lower borrowing costs.

164
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:37,256
So what does that mean?

165
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,495
So let's make it very clear.

166
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:49,073
So the Chinese buy treasuries,

167
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:52,016
which are essentially loans to the U.S. government,

168
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:54,136
then the U.S. has lower borrowing costs.

169
00:09:54,136 --> 00:10:00,069
The U.S. has lower interest or borrowing cost.

170
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:04,009
And I'm talking about the government right now.

171
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:07,029
And this has several interesting side effects.

172
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:20,994
This means that it's easier for the government to finance deficits.

173
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:25,696
They don't have to pay as much in interest to finance deficits.

174
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:28,360
So that means that they can spend more.

175
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,787
They can give out more payments to U.S. citizens,

176
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:33,973
or they could lower taxes, either one.

177
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:35,618
Both of those would lead to deficits.

178
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:44,344
So it's easier so that the government can either spend more

179
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,996
or they don't have to raise taxes.

180
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,066
Or they could they could lower taxes,

181
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,053
because they don't have to spend as much in interest.

182
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:54,060
Now, the other interesting thing

183
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,789
that the U.S. Treasury borrowing costs go down,

184
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,901
that means that the interest rate on everything goes down.

185
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:02,076
This is one of the benchmark interest rates.

186
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:05,008
And you should watch the video on the yield curve

187
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:06,581
if you want to understand more about it.

188
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:07,820
And I know some of you are saying, wait,

189
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,082
doesn't the Federal Reserve set interest rates?

190
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:14,071
The Federal Reserve only sets overnight, very short-term.

191
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,014
If you're going to borrow money overnight in your bank,

192
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:18,038
that's what the Federal Reserve sets.

193
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:23,201
If the U.S. government is borrowing money over 5 or 10 years or 20 years,

194
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:25,010
that is set by the market.

195
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,758
That is set by a market mechanism

196
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:29,964
very similar to what I showed just over here.

197
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:33,581
So this is dependent on more capital being there to be borrowed.

198
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:36,091
So this is, so 10-year, and 15-year,

199
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:39,089
and 20-year debt for the U.S. becomes cheaper.

200
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:52,168
But this makes all debt in the U.S. cheaper.

201
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:55,906
And there's two ways you can think about why this piece happens.

202
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:58,016
One is, just on a very superficial level, people say,

203
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:02,011
hey, you know, someone like General Electric is

204
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:04,061
only a little bit more risky than the U.S. government.

205
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:09,126
If the U.S. government only has to pay 3% on its on debt

206
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:11,051
that it has to pay back in 10 years,

207
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:16,000
maybe General Electric should only have to pay 0.3% more than that.

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,095
So you use the U.S. government as a baseline,

209
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:20,041
and then depending on people's risk,

210
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,157
they pay a little higher spread.

211
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:26,982
Another way to think about it is up here.

212
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:29,529
The Chinese government is just pouring dollars

213
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,098
either directly into the U.S. government,

214
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:36,745
or into the actual U.S. Treasury market.

215
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:39,315
So this guy right now, he has more dollars.

216
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:40,684
He's not going to use the Treasury,

217
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:42,085
because he thinks treasuries are too expensive,

218
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:44,024
which means that their interest is too low.

219
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:47,318
So he's going to take these dollars he got from the Chinese,

220
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:48,939
and he's going to lend it to someone else.

221
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:50,685
That dollar is still there.

222
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,050
He'll lend it to General Electric,

223
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,064
or maybe he's a credit card company and he'll lend it to the consumer.

224
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:59,588
So in general, all debt in the U.S. gets cheaper.

225
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:02,074
Now, what's the net effect of all of these points?

226
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,087
What's the net effect of this,

227
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:06,785
all debt in the U.S. becomes cheaper?

228
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:10,062
There's just more dollars for loan in the U.S.,

229
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:12,034
more dollars than people can borrow.

230
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:14,668
The government is spending more,

231
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,000
or the government will lower taxes.

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,001
What is the net effect of all of this?

233
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:21,983
Well, people will either have more money in their pockets,

234
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:23,767
because they've gotten a government job

235
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:26,009
or they've maybe gotten some type of entitlement payment.

236
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,000
Or, they're going to have more money in their pockets,

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,724
because they're paying lower taxes.

238
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:32,155
Or they're going to have more money in their pockets,

239
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:35,225
because it's easier for them to put more debt on their credit card,

240
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:37,575
or to refinance their mortgage.

241
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:47,079
So, all of these lead to more cash in American pockets.

242
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:51,003
Now, that's obviously not an unambiguously good thing,

243
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:53,058
because this is all financed with debt.

244
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:56,487
It's not just solid debt-free cash.

245
00:13:56,487 --> 00:14:08,191
So, more cash in American pockets essentially financed with debt.

246
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:10,054
And this debt, as you can see,

247
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:12,530
it's either occurring at the credit card level,

248
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,692
it could be occurring even at the corporate debt level,

249
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:18,087
or it's occurring indirectly at the government level.

250
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:20,087
But all of this is being enabled by the fact that

251
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:23,057
China is willing to buy treasuries, which means that

252
00:14:23,057 --> 00:14:26,593
China is really just willing to lend to the U.S.

253
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:28,062
So what's happening?

254
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:32,010
China is artificially keeping its currency low,

255
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,008
and it's doing that by buying dollars, taking those dollars

256
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,704
and essentially lending them to the United States.

257
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:42,057
And that eventually ends up

258
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,973
in the hands of American people and companies, and even the government.

259
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:46,552
And what are they going to do?

260
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,607
Well, they're going to buy cheap Chinese products

261
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:53,806
that are artificially cheap because the currency is lower.

262
00:14:53,806 --> 00:15:01,437
So then they will buy Chinese, artificially inexpensive.

263
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:03,750
And obviously, you know, they do have lower labor costs and all of that,

264
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,404
but it's even lower to the American than it would be

265
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:09,267
if the currency were allowed to freely float.

266
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:11,667
buy Chinese products.

267
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:15,039
So the net effect of this entire scenario

268
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,082
that I've been describing over the last few videos,

269
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:22,030
is that the Chinese are essentially lending money to the Americans

270
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,861
to then go ahead and buy more Chinese products.
