00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,300
Welcome back. We're on problem number 15.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,150
And I've tried it as best as I can to draw it.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,140
And they're pretty much saying-- well, I'll read it--

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,320
Doug's biology experiment involving timing 12 hamsters

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,060
in a maze. Each hamster received

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,180
at least one practice before being timed.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,500
The scatter plot above shows the time each hamster took

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,800
to complete the maze and the corresponding number of practices

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,650
that each hamster received. Based on the data,

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,850
which of the following functions best models

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,130
the relationship between t,

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,060
the number of seconds to complete the maze--

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,730
this is the t-axis-- and p, the number of practices?

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,100
This is p, the number of practices.

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,640
So we want to find t as a function of p.

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,750
So t is a function of p.

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,420
So, one, it looks like the hamsters didn't learn much

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,170
when they got practice.

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,970
No matter how much practice they got, the hamsters,

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,430
it looks like they roughly took about the same amount of time

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,670
We could try to draw a line here that fits this curve.

22
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,980
Maybe it would look something like this.

23
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,810
I don't know,something like that.I mean,it's not going to be

24
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,970
you could try to be cute and try to draw something

25
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,680
maybe with a little bit of a slope or anything,

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,380
but I mean, really, this looks like a flat line

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,320
when you look at it.

28
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,370
So what would be the equation of that line?

29
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,730
Well, the equation of that line would be like 45

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,470
or 44 or something. So if you said t of p is equal to--

31
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,660
and actually, they have a choice that looks just like that--

32
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,370
t of p is equal to 44.

33
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,830
No matter how many practices the mice got,

34
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,880
regardless of how many,

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,060
they on average take roughly 44 seconds.

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,640
So practice doesn't really help mice much,

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,200
as opposed to students preparing for the SAT.

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,950
And all of the other ones don't make any sense.

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,500
I mean, t of p equals p. That would be something like this.

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,820
Choice A is something like that, that has no sense.

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,680
No, sorry, choice A is our answer.

42
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:06,030
Choice B looks something like that. Choice C, 44p.

43
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,710
That will be even a super steep. That makes no sense.

44
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,780
P/44, that's going to be like a really shallow graph.

45
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,640
And then you could have p plus 44.

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,190
That would start here and then have a slope of 1,

47
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,930
so it would look like that.

48
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,360
So none of the other ones are even close.

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,940
So it's definitely choice A. t of p is equal to 44.

50
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,090
Last problem. And I'll do a new color. Problem 16.

51
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,510
And they drew this thing, so I have a big square.

52
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,650
And then we have a square like that.

53
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,440
Actually, I should just use the line tool,

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,280
that would be better. A square like that. A square like that.

55
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:08,230
And then I have a square like that, roughly.

56
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,480
It's not perfectly drawn

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,090
because these three squares look the same,

58
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,560
and they tell us they're the same.

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:23,190
They tell us that this is W. And this is L. W, W, W. L, L.

60
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,110
The pattern shown above is composed of rectangles.

61
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,580
This pattern is used repeatedly to completely cover

62
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,980
a rectangular region 12 units long and 11 units wide.

63
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:45,690
So they're covering a region that's 12L long and 10L wide.

64
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,920
So this is like a thumbnail of the floor.

65
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,050
How many rectangles of dimension L by W are needed?

66
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,310
OK.Well,when they say how many rectangles of dimension L by W

67
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,960
that's just each of these rectangles that they drew here.

68
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,060
Right? Because all of these have dimensions L by W, L by W,

69
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,330
L by W, L by W, L by W, right?

70
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,580
So if we could figure out just how many of these--

71
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,040
this pattern has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of those on it, right?

72
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,590
So if we could just figure out

73
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:30,110
how many of this pattern would fit onto this,then we're done.

74
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,830
So how can we figure that out?

75
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,880
So do we know a relationship between L and W? Well, sure.

76
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,090
We see here that two L's are the same thing as three W's.

77
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:53,300
We know that 2L is equal to three W's.

78
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,390
And since all our dimensions are given in L,

79
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,580
let's solve for W and substitute.

80
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,240
So let's say that W is equal to--

81
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,040
just divide both sides by 3-- W is equal to 2/3 L.

82
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,630
All I said is 2L is the same thing as 3W

83
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,620
and I divided it by 3. So W is equal to 2/3 L.

84
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,250
So can we represent the height

85
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,700
and the width of this rectangle now in terms of only L's?

86
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,600
Well, sure. What's the height?

87
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,140
What's the length of this rectangle?

88
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,300
Well, the length is definitely just 2L, right?

89
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,080
L plus L. That's the length. And what's the width?

90
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,820
Well, W is what?

91
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,860
It's 2/3 L plus L, so what's the width of this rectangle?

92
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,360
What's 2/3 of something plus 1 whole of that something?

93
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,840
Or 2/3 plus 3/3? So the width is 5/3 L.

94
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:03,940
So each of these rectangles is 5/3 L by 2L.

95
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,850
So how many of these rectangles are we going to have to

96
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,880
put onto this floor? How many total?

97
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,050
Well, going in this dimension they have a length of 2L.

98
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,890
So if we have to-- if they're 2L each,

99
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,740
then we're going to need six of them, right?

100
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,200
We're going to need 6 in this direction.

101
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,220
Because we're going to go a total distance of 12L,

102
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,380
and they're 2L each.

103
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,250
So they're going to be 6 in that direction.

104
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,050
And how many are we going to need in this direction?

105
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,660
Well, we have to go a total distance of 10L.

106
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,780
And the width of each of them is 5/3 L.

107
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,890
So what's 10 divided by 5/3? So the L's cancel out.

108
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,360
So 10 divided by 5/3 is the same thing as 10 times 3/5.

109
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,260
And that just equals 6.

110
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,240
So we're going to need 6 rectangles in this direction as well

111
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,700
So how many total rectangles are we going to need?

112
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,790
Well, 6 times 6 is equal to 36 total rectangles. And then,

113
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,930
how many of these smaller rectangles are in each of these?

114
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,780
We'll need 36 of this pattern.

115
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,830
And then how many of the rectangles are in that pattern?

116
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,300
Well, we counted. There's 5.

117
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,990
So we're going to need 5 times 36 total of

118
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,060
these smaller rectangles. So 5 times 36 is what?

119
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,800
150 plus 30? It's 180.

120
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,230
We will need 180 of these smaller rectangles.

121
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:34,070
So that is choice E. And we are done with this test three.

122
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,890
I'll see you in test four.
