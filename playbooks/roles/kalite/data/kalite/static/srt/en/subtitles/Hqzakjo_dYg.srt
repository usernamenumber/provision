1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,340
SAL: Let's do a couple more
of these exponential decay

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,500
problems, because a lot of this
really is just practice

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,220
and being very comfortable with
the general formula, and

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,270
I'll write it again.

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,000
Where the amount of the element
that's decaying, that

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,760
we have at any period in time,
is equal to the amount that we

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,150
started with, times
e to the minus kt.

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,660
Where the k value is specific to
any certain element with a

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,560
certain half-life, and sometimes
they don't even give

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,600
you the half-life.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,020
So let's try this interesting
situation.

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,940
Let's say that I have
an element.

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,890
Let me just give
you a formula.

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,180
Let's say that I have some magic
element here, where its

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,560
formula is, its k value I give
to you, k is equal to minus,

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,440
let me think of a-- [coughs]

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,720
Excuse me, I just had a lot of
walnuts and my throat is dry.

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,530
Let's say that k is equal to,
well k, we're putting a minus

20
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,940
in front of it, so I'll
say the k value

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,440
is a positive 0.05.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,950
So its exponential decay formula
would be the amount

23
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,760
that you start off with, times
e to the minus 0.05t.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,520
My question to you is, given
this, what is the half-life of

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,910
the compound that we're
talking about?

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,770
What is the half-life?

27
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,710
   

28
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,630
So to figure that out, we need
to figure out what t value can

29
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,330
we put here, so that if we start
off with whatever value

30
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,370
here, we end up with 1/2
of that value there.

31
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,960
So let's do that.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,370
So we're starting off with N sub
0 This is just some value,

33
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,410
our initial starting point.

34
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,790
We could put 100 there.

35
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,050
Actually, let's do that, just to
keep things less abstract.

36
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,840
So let's say we start
with 100.

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,200
I'm just picking
100 out of air.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,340
I could have left it
abstract with N.

39
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,220
Let's say I'm starting
with 100.

40
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,720
And I take the 100 times e to
the minus 0.05, times t.

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,850
t is whatever our half-life.

42
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,900
So after our half-life we're
going to have 1/2 of this

43
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,940
stuff left.

44
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,510
So this should be equal to 50.

45
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,500
We just solved for t.

46
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,170
Divide both sides by 100.

47
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,259
You get e to the minus 0.05t,
is equal to 1/2.

48
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,265
You take the natural log
of both sides of this.

49
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:17,960
The natural log of this, the
natural log of that.

50
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,770
And then you get-- the natural
log of e to anything, I've

51
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,790
said it before, is just
the anything.

52
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:29,450
So it is minus 0.05t is equal
to the natural log of 1/2.

53
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,710
And then you get t is equal
to the natural log of 1/2,

54
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,900
divided by minus 0.05.

55
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,440
So let's figure out
what that is.

56
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,190
   

57
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,490
Actually, someone just
made a comment, and I

58
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,820
might as well do that.

59
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,570
I could just put this
minus up here.

60
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,170
I could make this a plus, and
this a minus, if I just

61
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,110
multiply the numerator and the
denominator by negative 1.

62
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,436
And if I want to, just to make
the calculator math a little

63
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:58,390
easier, if you put a minus in
front of a natural log, or any

64
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,730
logarithm, that's the same
thing as the log of the

65
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,330
inverse of 2 over 0.05.

66
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,635
It makes the calculator math
a little bit easier.

67
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:08,860
The same thing.

68
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:16,550
So if I do 2 natural log,
divided by 0.05,

69
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,230
it is equal to 13.86.

70
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,310
So when t is equal to 13.86.

71
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,270
And I'm assuming that we're
dealing with time in years.

72
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,070
That tends to be the convention,
although sometimes

73
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,580
it could be something else
and you'd always have

74
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,890
to convert to years.

75
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,600
But assuming that this original
formula, where they

76
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,790
gave this k value 0.05, that was
with the assumption that t

77
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,410
is in years, and I've just
solved its half-life.

78
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,430
I just solved that after 13.86
years, you can expect to have

79
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,720
1/2 of the substance left.

80
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,840
We started with 100, we
ended up with 50.

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,370
I could have started with x and
ended up with x over 2.

82
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,140
Let's do one more of these
problems, just so that we're

83
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,520
really comfortable
with the formula.

84
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:13,060
Let's say that I have something
with a half-life of,

85
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,399
I don't know, let's say I
have it as one month.

86
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,010
Half-life of one month.

87
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:27,170
And after, well let's say that
I-- well let me just for the

88
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,910
sake of time, let me make
it a little bit simpler.

89
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,670
Let's say I just have my k value
is equal to-- I mean you

90
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,010
can go from half-life to a k
value, we did that in the

91
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,480
previous video.

92
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,140
Let's say my k value
is equal to 0.001.

93
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,130
So my general formula is the
amount of product I have, is

94
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,180
equal to the amount that I
started with times e to the

95
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,410
minus 0.001 times t.

96
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,590
And I gave you this, if you
have to figure it out from

97
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,190
half-life, I did that in the
previous video with carbon-14.

98
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,840
But let's say this
is the formula.

99
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:06,160
And let's say that after, I
don't know, let's say after

100
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:14,520
1000 years I have 500 grams of
whatever element is described.

101
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,320
The decay formula for
whatever element is

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,710
described by this formula.

103
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,110
How much did I start off with?

104
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,090
   

105
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,340
So essentially I need to figure
out N sub 0, right?

106
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:32,320
I'm saying that after 1000
years, so N of 1000, which is

107
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,330
equal to N sub naught
times e to the minus

108
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,720
0.001, times 1000.

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,020
Right?

110
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,730
That's the N of 1000.

111
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,350
And I'm saying that that's
equal to 500 grams. That

112
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,560
equals 500 grams. So
I just have to

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,590
solve for N sub naught.

114
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,830
So what's the e value?

115
00:05:53,830 --> 00:06:02,560
So if I have 0.0001 times 1000,
so this is N sub naught.

116
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
This is 1/1000 of a 1000-- so
times e to the minus 1 is

117
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,075
equal to 500 grams. Or I could
multiply both sides by e, and

118
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:17,410
I have N sub naught is equal to
500e, which is about 2.71.

119
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:23,280
So it's 500 times 2.71.

120
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,460
I don't actually have e on this
calculator or at least I

121
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,555
don't see it.

122
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:33,710
So we'll have 1,355 grams. So
it's equal to 1,355 grams, or

123
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,940
1.355 kilograms. That's
what I started with.

124
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,310
   

125
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,230
So hopefully you see now.

126
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,310
I mean, I think we've approached
this pretty much at

127
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,590
almost any direction that a
chemistry test or teacher

128
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,610
could throw the problem
at you.

129
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,870
But you really just need to
remember this formula.

130
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,370
And this applies to
a lot of things.

131
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,800
Later you'll learn, you know,
when you do compound interest

132
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,690
in finance, the k will just be
a positive value, but it's

133
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,230
essentially the same formula.

134
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,350
And there's a lot of things
that this formula actually

135
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,210
describes well beyond just
radioactive decay.

136
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,330
But the simple idea is, use
information they give you to

137
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,690
solve for as many of these
constants as you can.

138
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,160
And then whatever they're
asking for, solve for

139
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
whatever's left over.

140
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,550
And hopefully I've given you
enough examples of that.

141
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,060
But let me know, I'm
happy to do more.
