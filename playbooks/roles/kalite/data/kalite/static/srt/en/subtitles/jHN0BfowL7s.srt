00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:07,059
Dr. Steven Zucker (Dr. S.Z.): We are in the Uffizi and we are looking at Rafael

2
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:09,006
this is the "Maddona of the Goldfinch" .

3
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:10,894
Which is a really funny title

4
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:11,970
Dr Beth Harris (Dr. B.H.): It is a funny title

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,724
St. John who we see here on the left is holding out a goldfinch, the bird to the Christ Child

6
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:19,170
who strokes it's head.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,033
And the Goldfinch is a symbol of the Passion of Christ,

8
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:26,188
of Christ's suffering. And so we have that idea

9
00:00:26,188 --> 00:00:30,886
that we often have of the foretelling of Christ's terrible future.

10
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:34,410
Dr S.Z: But at the same time this is a painting of two children and a mother.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,815
And - So it exists on several different planes

12
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:39,162
because they're childern doing childlike things:

13
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:42,895
one showing a pet to another, one wanting to touch it

14
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:44,872
uh, the mother looking down protectively

15
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:48,975
Dr. B. H: and even a kind of tenderness between the mother and son.

16
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:52,428
Look at the way that Christ put his foot on his mother's,

17
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:56,273
so there is that skin-to-skin moment of human contact there,

18
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:59,418
that's really lovely, but, to me Christ doesn't look like

19
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:03,170
a child having fun. He looks very much 'all knowing'.

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,543
As opposed, if you are looking at the painting from 1300s

21
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:09,478
Christ would look - instead of looking like a baby, he would look like a little man

22
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,209
in order to indicate his sense of wisdom.

23
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:18,994
But here I think Rafael communicates that through the elegance of Christ's body.

24
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:21,120
Look at the way he lifts his arm up,

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,301
strokes the Goldfinch, tilts his head back.

26
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:27,441
He stands in this incredibly elegant 'contrapposto' (counterpose)

27
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:29,346
that no child would ever stand in.

28
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:31,655
Dr. S.Z: It's true
Dr.B.H:I mean it's such a pose

29
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:34,870
Dr S.Z: and it is a beautiful foreshortening of his head, of his face

30
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,059
as he leans back. But then there's a kind of energy and child likeness

31
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:41,109
that we see in John.

32
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:43,406
John seems to so engaged, 'Look what I can show you!'

33
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:47,538
Dr. B.H:and yet it's the symbol, this really potent symbol of Christ's suffering.

34
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:51,035
Dr S.Z: What so interesting is that unlike in the 1300s, as you mentioned before,

35
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:54,193
we don't have the Madonna on a throne.

36
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:56,923
Here the nature itself is the throne, you know?

37
00:01:56,923 --> 00:02:00,993
We have this verdant environment, this beautiful atmospheric perspective

38
00:02:00,993 --> 00:02:02,689
and she sits on a rock.

39
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,813
That is: 'divinity is all around us'.

40
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:08,435
By the time we get to the late 15th century to the early 16th century,

41
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:12,708
in the High Renaissance, nature itself has taken on the expression of God.

42
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,590
We don't need, in a sense, those kingly symbols.

43
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,176
Dr B.H: Look at how composed it is, in a way we don't even notice immediately:

44
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:22,800
We have a pyramid composition with Mary at the top

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,068
and St. John and Christ on either side.

46
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:27,964
And that sense of real stability and balance

47
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:30,681
that's also so much a part of the High Renaissance.

48
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:33,175
Dr S.Z: Even as the figures are so engaged with each other, and

49
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:39,677
this dialog that's taking place between them, there is also that sense, that High Renaissance sense or right

50
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,866
of balance, of perfection of the eternal.

51
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:45,023
Dr B.H: That interlocking of gestures and glances,

52
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:48,805
Mary looking down at John, John looking at Christ, Christ looking back at John

53
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:54,046
all of them inclosed within the pyramid structure of Mary's body,

54
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:57,708
that unified composition, that brings everythings together

55
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,805
in this really lovely landscape.

56
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,802
Dr S.Z:I'm intrigued by the book.

57
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:05,560
Mary had been reading, she's kept her place. And, of course, that reminds us

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,725
of an earlier scene, 'The Annunciation', when Gabriel interrupts her as she's been piously reading the Bible.

59
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:14,403
but here she's been reading and now she is interrupted by her charges.

60
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:18,403
She's doing a little bit of babysitting.
