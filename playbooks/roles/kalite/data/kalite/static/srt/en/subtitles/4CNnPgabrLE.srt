00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,470
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,850
I was just chugging through the
hairy math of this problem,

4
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,300
which I think we're
almost done.

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,950
But as I was saying, we're
just simplifying this.

6
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,880
We have 25 times sine
squared of 15 plus

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,010
cosine squared of 15.

8
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,730
I said well, that's
an identity, right?

9
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,690
Remember, I
undistributed this 25.

10
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,190
So sine squared plus cosine
squared of the same angle is 1.

11
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,130
So I can simplify this to --
and I will now change colors

12
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,810
just to be arbitrary.

13
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:35,240
So, 25 plus 100 minus 100
cosine of 15 degrees, and this

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,090
is what m squared is equal to,
and I used the variable m

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,910
because it stands for nothing
relevant to this problem.

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:49,440
And that equals 125 minus
100 cosine of 15 degrees.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,320
Now I have to use a calculator
if I want to get a real answer.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,060
But the possibility for error
is much lower now that I've

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,320
hopefully simplified it.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,080
So I could use my calculator,
and the cosine of 15 degrees --

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,610
I'll write that down here, you
could just use a calculator or

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:20,220
table to figure that out --
it is equal to 0.96593.

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,040
So this term would be 125
minus 100 times this, right?

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,430
So what's 100 times this?

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,600
Well that's just minus 96.593,
right, I just did 100 times

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,880
the cosine of 15 degrees.

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,970
And now let me use the
trusty calculator to

28
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,220
figure out what that is.

29
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:56,800
So if I say 125 minus
96.593, I get 28.407.

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,050
So I have m squared
is equal to 28.407.

31
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,492
And so m is equal to the
square root of that.

32
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:08,910
It's going to be 5 point
something, right?

33
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,970
Square root.

34
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,220
5.3298.

35
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,950
So 5.33.

36
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,690
m is equal to 5.33.

37
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,570
And we're done.

38
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,870
The poor guy -- he's got to
figure out the right direction

39
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,040
to go in and he probably has to
think about the current in all

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,820
of that, but he hasn't asked us
that question so we

41
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,300
won't answer it.

42
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,190
But all he has left
to go is 5.33 miles.

43
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,770
So he only has to go an extra
0.33 miles than he would have,

44
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,240
had he gone in the right
direction from the get-go.

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,490
Hopefully that
makes some sense.

46
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,740
If it doesn't, well, not much
I can do, but maybe you

47
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,960
can re-watch this video.

48
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,460
Have fun.

49
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,400
