1
00:00:02,472 --> 00:00:03,893
Let's say that you've got a blood vessel

2
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:08,090
here, and it's a longish blood vessel

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,226
and we'll give it a resistance of eight, and it has three branches

4
00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:15,956
say two big ones, and a tiny one in the middle

5
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:19,441
and this goes straight across, and this has a resistance

6
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,910
of ten, and these biggish ones, they

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:29,404
have resistance of say, half that, so they're about

8
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:36,838
five, and on this side, they all come together again

9
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:41,122
and enter a short vessel, this has a resistance of three

10
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:47,167
so my question to you is what is the total resistance of blood going in here

11
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:53,912
and out here? So, again, it's going to have to go through this eight bit, and then it has three choices here

12
00:00:53,912 --> 00:01:01,826
here, here or here, but eventually they all come together again into that three bit, and then exit out the other side

13
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:08,922
So, what is the total resistance, so what is Rt resistance, that's the question, and

14
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:13,326
what I'm going to do is to divide this into two parts: part one

15
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:19,235
i'm going to figure out in part one, what the resistance is for this part, right in here

16
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:26,106
so I can do that using an equation I introduced in the last video, which was you can basically take

17
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:41,139
Rt, which is the total resistance for that yellow box, equals one over, one over five plus one over ten plus one over five

18
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:46,057
and i can look at that and tell you that the common denominator is going to be ten

19
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:52,591
Right? For all three, and in the numerator, we got two, one and two.

20
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:58,237
So, putting it all together, I got one over..., what is that, five over ten.

21
00:01:58,237 --> 00:02:03,610
And that equals, ten over five, which equals two

22
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:10,087
So that tells me that the resistance in this middle, yellow box is two

23
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:15,261
and that makes sense with our rule, because we said that when things are in parallel, the total resistance

24
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:22,743
is going to be less than any components, and in fact two is less than five, ten and five, right?

25
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,704
It's less than any of those numbers individually.

26
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:30,781
So, we've got now in part two, we have three things in series, right?

27
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:43,693
We basically have something like this, we have eight, and we have two, and we have three.

28
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:48,041
So, we've got basically three things in the series, and so we simply add those up

29
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:54,808
and i'm going to say Rt now equals eight plus two plus three

30
00:02:54,808 --> 00:03:01,561
And so Rt equals thirteen, so if I wanted to know what is my total Rt, my total resistance

31
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:07,843
I would say it is thirteen, so that's the answer to this problem

32
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:13,200
And, what I wanted to get you thinking about is total resistance for the body, the human body

33
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,337
, which has obviously more than just a few vessels, unlike I have in this diagram here

34
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:22,399
LIterally, thousands and thousands of vessels
