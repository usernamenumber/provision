1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,060
Welcome back. We're on problem number six, on page 670.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:15,240
If the average of 6, 6, 12,16,

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,000
and x-- the average is equal to x, what is the value of x?

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,630
So if I were to average all these numbers, I get x.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,120
How do I average? I add them up, I add up the numbers,

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,010
and I divide by the number of numbers there are.

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,490
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 numbers, so I divide by that.

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,240
And they're saying that this average is going to equal x.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,340
So let's multiply both sides by 5.

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:48,170
And I get 6 plus 6 plus 12 plus 16 plus x is equal to 20

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,740
my brain is malfunctioning,the average is equal to x, right?

12
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,400
So I have to multiply both sides by 5.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,010
So I multiply both sides by 5, I get 5x. Right?

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,470
This is the average, and they say the average is equal to x.

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,000
Multiply both sides by 5, you get rid of the 5 in the

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,090
denominator here, you get 5x on the right-hand side.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,860
And what's the sum?

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,790
6 plus 6 is 12, 12 plus 12 is 24, 24 plus 16 is 40.

19
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,310
So we get 40 plus x is equal to 5x.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,050
Subtract x from both sides,40 is equal to 4x.

21
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,630
Divide both sides by 4, you get x is equal to 10.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:44,160
And that is choice D. Next problem. Let me draw this triangle.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,060
Let me try my best to draw the triangle.

24
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,020
Looks something like that.

25
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,290
And then there's an altitude right here,

26
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,070
just drop straight down.

27
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,050
And then they tell us that this is a 90-- or do they tell us?

28
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,000
My cousin who used my book drew over it, so I'm not sure.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,500
But I'm pretty sure they tell us that

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,140
this is a 90 degree angle.

31
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,780
For the figure above, what is the value of z?

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:20,040
So they say this is z, this is y, this is 2y,

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,010
and this is 40 degrees. So what is z?

34
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,220
So we know this is a 90 degree angle, and we know that z plus

35
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,410
y plus 90 is equal to 180.

36
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,640
So if we know what y is,we could figure out z.

37
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,790
And how can we figure out y? Well we know that 2y

38
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,500
if we look at this right-hand triangle

39
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:59,630
we know that 2y plus 40 plus 90 is equal to 180. Right?

40
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:09,460
So 2y plus 130 is equal to 180. 2y is equal to 50 degrees.

41
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:17,690
y is equal to 25 degrees. So this is 25 degrees.

42
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,350
I really wish I could read this problem, I'm pretty sure

43
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,590
they drew in a little perpendicular but anyway,

44
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,050
we might have been able to address it even if they didn't.

45
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:31,460
But if y is 25, then we know that z plus 25 plus 90 is

46
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,090
equal to 180. z plus 115 is equal to 180.

47
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,430
z is equal to-- subtract 115 from both sides,

48
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,900
what's 80 minus 15? 65. The choice is C.

49
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,910
Next problem, problem number eight.

50
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,000
A computer program randomly selects a positive 2 digit integer

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,030
If the integer selected is odd, twice that integer is printed

52
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,150
So odd, it prints 2 times integer.

53
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,000
If the integer is even, the integer itself is printed.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,030
So if it's even, it just prints the integer.

55
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,980
So if it's an odd and you multiply it by 2,

56
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,780
it's actually going to print an even integer no matter what.

57
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,580
If the integer printed is 26,

58
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,000
which of the following could have been the integer selected?

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,640
So all we see is 26. We just see 26.

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,750
So 26 could've been generated one of two ways.

61
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,800
It could have been generated by an even number that was

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,040
just kept the same.

63
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,230
Well, if it was an even number that was kept the same and

64
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,580
you got 26, then we know that the number is 26.

65
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,040
The number that generated was 26.

66
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,000
The other possibility is it could've been an odd number

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,070
that was doubled, right?

68
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,630
If it was an odd number that was doubled,

69
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:14,060
that means 2 times the odd number is equal to 26.

70
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,710
So that means that the number would have to be 13, right?

71
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,740
13 times odd-- sorry-- 2 times odd-- these are the two

72
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,990
situations-- 2 times odd is going to be equal to 26,

73
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,030
in which case odd is equal to 13.

74
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,110
Or 1 times even is going to be equal to 26,

75
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,080
it which case even equals 26.

76
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,490
So the number generated could've been 26

77
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,070
or it could have been 13.

78
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,330
And those are choices 1 and 2, and that's C.

79
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,560
Next problem, problem number nine.

80
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,210
They give you choice 52 in that last problem just to

81
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,470
confuse you, to actually end up doubling the 26,

82
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,580
but we know that the odd number was doubled to get 26,

83
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,000
so the number generated would have been 13.

84
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,270
Problem number nine.

85
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:15,900
How many seconds are there in m minutes and s seconds?

86
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,050
Well, how many seconds are there per minute?

87
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:30,010
Let's write this expression as m minutes plus s seconds,

88
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,940
right? Well, what does m equal in terms of seconds?

89
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,000
Or how many seconds are there per minute?

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,680
Well, we know that there are 60 seconds per m, right?

91
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:54,020
Or we could say that 60 seconds is equal to 1m, right?

92
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:01,890
So if there's 60 seconds in 1m,how many-- actually,

93
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,590
I'm confusing the issue, let me write it this way.

94
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,020
m minutes, right? There's m minutes.

95
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,570
How many seconds are there per minute?

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let me start over,because I think I confused you a little bit

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,830
So I'm going to write--actually, let me write it

98
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,000
without m and s, that's what confusing me as well.

99
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:27,970
Let's say I have x minutes plus y seconds,

100
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,030
and I want to convert it all into seconds.

101
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, we know that there are 60 seconds per minute, right?

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,880
So if we want to convert a minute to seconds, we write

103
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:53,520
x minutes times 60 seconds per minute plus y seconds.

104
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,070
And so the minutes will cancel out, and so you're left with

105
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,000
60 times x-- and this is something that you'll learn in

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,230
physics class, that you can treat units just like you

107
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,020
would treat variables, and they'll cancel out similarly.

108
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,750
So you'd get 60x-- right, the minutes have canceled out--

109
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,460
let me switch colors--you'll get 60 times x seconds,

110
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,740
plus y seconds.

111
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,450
So your total number of seconds is 60x plus y.

112
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,100
And in the problem though, in minutes they didn't say x,

113
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,880
they said m, so x is m, and then y is s.

114
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:38,600
So 60m plus s, so that's choice A.

115
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,750
And this might have been a little confusing, let me do it

116
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,040
a simpler way, or maybe a more intuitive way for you.

117
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,090
There's m minutes, how many seconds are in m minutes?

118
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,260
Think about it. If there is

119
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,160
if I'm talking about 2 minutes,there's 60 seconds per minute,

120
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,570
so if I said 2 minutes, I would multiply 2 times 60,

121
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,420
and I would get to 120 seconds. If it was 5 minutes,

122
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,680
I would multiply 5 times 60, and get to 300 seconds.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,480
So if I have m minutes,

124
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll multiply 60 times m to get 60m seconds.

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,010
And of course, they said m minutes plus s seconds.

126
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:31,030
So now I have 60m seconds,plus these s seconds.

127
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,000
So my total number of seconds is 60m plus s.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,630
This is a more intuitive way, maybe.

129
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,150
You should always try out numbers,

130
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,790
and hopefully it'll make a little bit more sense.

131
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,000
The way I did it previously is how you would do it in physics

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,410
class, where you would actually cancel out the units

133
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,620
and make sure you're doing it the right way.

134
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,070
See you in the next video.
