1
00:00:01,858 --> 00:00:03,700
We'll now learn about what is arguably the most useful concept in finance

2
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:06,800
and that is called the present value.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,681
And if you know the present value

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:12,446
then it's very easy to understand

5
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:15,418
the net present value and the discounted cash flow

6
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:16,858
and the internal rate of return

7
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:18,344
and we'll eventually learn all of those things.

8
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:20,700
But the present value, what does that mean?

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,031
Present value.

10
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:29,443
So let's do a little exercise.

11
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:32,508
I could pay you a hundred dollars today.

12
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:37,216
So let's say today

13
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:42,000
I could pay you one hundred dollars.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,480
Or (and it's up to you) in one year, I will pay you

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,607
I don't know, let's say in a year I agree to pay you $110.

16
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:00,800
And my question to you

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,700
and this is a fundamental question of finance

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,366
everything will build upon this

19
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:06,800
is which one would you prefer?

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,000
and this is guaranteed.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,200
I guarantee you, I'm either going to pay you $100 today

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,211
and there's no risk, even if I get hit by a truck or whatever.

23
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:16,500
This is going to happen, if the Earth exists, I will pay you $110 in one year.

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,149
It is guaranteed, so there's no risk here.

25
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,400
So it's just a notion of

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,375
You're definitely gonna get $100 today, in your hand

27
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:34,300
or you're definitely gonna get $110 one year from now.

28
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,500
So how do you compare the two?

29
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,200
And this is where present value comes in.

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,900
What if there were a way

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,982
to say, well what is $110

32
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:45,047
a guaranteed $110 in the future?

33
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:46,200
What if there were a way to say

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
How much is that worth today?

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,200
How much is that worth in today's terms?

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,700
So let's do a little thought experiment.

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,447
Let's say that you could put money

38
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:00,558
in some, let's say you could money in the bank.

39
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:02,600
And these days, banks are kind a risky.

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,400
But let's say you could put it in the safest bank in the world.

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,614
Let's say you could put it in government treasuries

42
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:11,400
which are considered risk free

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,047
because the US government, the treasury

44
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:17,800
can always indirectly print more money.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,877
We'll one day do a whole thing on the money supply.

46
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:21,270
But at the end of the day

47
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,700
the US government has the rights on the printing press, etc.

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,889
It's more complicated than that, but for these purposes, we assume

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,815
that the US treasury, which essentially is

50
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,905
you lending money to the US government

51
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:33,809
that it's risk free.

52
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:35,388
So let's say that

53
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,400
you could lend money

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,800
Let's say today, I could give you $100

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,286
and that you could invest it

56
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,400
at 5% risk free.

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,366
So you could invest it 5% risk free.

58
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:52,200
And then a year from now, how much would that be worth?

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,780
In a year.

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,531
That would be worth $105 in one year.

61
00:02:57,623 --> 00:03:03,271
Actually let me write $110 over here.

62
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,654
So this is a good way of thinking about it.

63
00:03:05,654 --> 00:03:09,300
You're like, okay. Instead of taking the money

64
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,300
from Sal a year from now

65
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,097
and getting $110 dollars,

66
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:16,348
If I were to take $100 today and put it in something risk free

67
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:18,902
in a year I would have $105.

68
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:22,900
So assuming I don't have to spend the money today

69
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,900
This is a better situation to be in. Right?

70
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,200
If I take the money today and risk-free

71
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,908
invest it at 5%, I'm gonna end up at

72
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:32,100
$105 in a year.

73
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,800
Instead, if you just tell me

74
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,271
Sal, just give me the money in a year and give me $110

75
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:39,939
you're gonna end up with more money in a year.

76
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,122
You're gonna end up with $110.

77
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,300
And that is actually the right way to think about it.

78
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,400
And remember, everything is risk-free.

79
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,600
Once you introduce risk,

80
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,593
And we have to start introducing different interest rates and

81
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:56,008
probabilities, and we'll get to that eventually.

82
00:03:56,008 --> 00:04:00,744
But I want to just give the purest example right now.

83
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:02,509
So already you've made the decision.

84
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,249
We still don't know what present value is.

85
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:06,503
So to some degree

86
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:07,600
when you took this $100 and you

87
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
said, well if I lend it to the government

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,519
or if I lend it to some risk-free bank at 5%

89
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,351
in a year they'll give me $105

90
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:18,577
This $105 is a way of saying, what is the one-year value of $100 today?

91
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,729
So what if we wanted to go in the other direction?

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,119
If we have a certain amount of money

93
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:31,100
and we want to figure out today's value

94
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,020
what could we do?

95
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,200
Well to go from here to here, what did we do?

96
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,500
We essentially took $100

97
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,300
and we multiplied by 1+5%.

98
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,742
So that's 1,05

99
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:49,367
So to go the other way,

100
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:50,900
to say how much money

101
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,200
if I were to grow it by 5%

102
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,700
would end up being $110, we'll just divide by 1,05

103
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,900
And then we will get the present value

104
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,503
And the notation is PV

105
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:12,308
We'll get the present value of $110 a year from now.

106
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:20,600
So $110 year from now.

107
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,900
So the present value of $110 in 2009

108
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,906
It's currently 2008

109
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:33,800
I don't know what year you're watching this video in.

110
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,300
Hopefully people will be watching this in the next millenia.

111
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,776
But the present value of $110 in 2009

112
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:47,928
— assuming right now is 2008— a year from now, is equal to $110

113
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:53,117
divided by 1,05.

114
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:57,283
Which is equal to— let's take out this calculator

115
00:05:57,283 --> 00:06:02,859
which is probably overkill for this problem— let me clear everything.

116
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:12,355
OK, so I want to do 110 divided by 1,05

117
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:16,906
is equal to 104 (let's just round) ,76.

118
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:24,894
So it equals $104,76.

119
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:28,656
So the present value of $110 a year from now

120
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:33,400
if we assume that we could invest money risk-free at 5%— if we would get it today—

121
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,500
the present value of that is— let me do it in a different color, just to fight the monotony—

122
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:47,092
the present value is equal to $104,76.

123
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:50,300
Another way to kind of just talk about this is to get

124
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,845
the present value of $110 a year from now, we discount the value by a discount rate.

125
00:06:56,845 --> 00:07:00,400
And the discount rate is this.

126
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
Here we grew the money by— you could say—

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,993
our yield, a 5% yield, or our interest.

128
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:10,916
Here we're discounting the money 'cause we're backwards in time—

129
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,099
we're going from a year out to the present.

130
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:18,021
And so this is our yield. To compound the amount of money we invest

131
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:22,400
we multiply the amount we invest times 1 plus the yield.

132
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,801
Then to discount money in the future to the present,

133
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:30,276
we divide it by 1 plus the discount rate— so this is

134
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:37,300
a 5% discount rate.

135
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,337
To get its present value.

136
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:41,300
So what does this tell us?

137
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,860
This tells us if someone is willing to pay $110— assuming this 5%, remember

138
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,108
this is a critical assumption— this tells us that if I tell you

139
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:56,427
I'm willing to pay you $110 a year from now

140
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:58,703
and you can get 5%, so you can kind of say

141
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:02,000
that 5% is your discount rate, risk-free.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,179
Then you should be willing to take today's money if

143
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:09,616
today I'm willing to give you more than the present value.

144
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:14,910
So, if this compares in— let me clear all of this,

145
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,100
let me just scroll down— so let's say

146
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:24,400
that one year— so today, one year—

147
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,164
so we figured out that $110 a year from now, its

148
00:08:31,164 --> 00:08:40,127
present value is equal to— so the present value of $110—

149
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:45,607
is equal to $104,76.

150
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:50,855
So— and that's 'cause I used a 5% discount rate (and that's the key assumption)—

151
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:53,700
what this tells you is— this is a dollar sign, I know it's hard to read—

152
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,517
what this tells you is, is that if your choice was between

153
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:03,765
$110 a year from now and $100 today,

154
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:08,800
you should take the $110 a year from now.

155
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,756
Why is that?

156
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:13,749
Because its present value is worth more than $100.

157
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:17,372
However, if I were to offer you $110 a year from now or

158
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:26,000
$105 today, this— the $105 today— would be the better choice,

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,214
because its present value— right, $105 today

160
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:31,954
you don't have to discount it, it's today— its present value

161
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:33,022
is itself.

162
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:38,700
$105 today is worth more than the present value of $110, which

163
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,981
is $104.76.

164
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:49,545
Another way to think about it is, I could take this $105 to the bank,

165
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:53,781
get 5% on it, and then I would have— what would

166
00:09:53,781 --> 00:10:04,601
I end up with?— I would end up with 105 times 1,05, it's equal to $110,25.

167
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:08,753
So a year from now, I'd be better off by a quarter.

168
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:11,614
And I'd have the joy of being able to touch my money for a year,

169
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:16,585
which is hard to quantify, so we leave it out of the equation.
