1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:04,261
Let's say there's some company A here

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:06,849
and let's think about what it's stock might be doing

3
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:11,514
let's say this is just over the course of the day let's say that it's stock is just trading right over here

4
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:15,872
so as we go through the day it's price naturally changes but then right over here

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:21,999
let's say this within the day. Maybe this is happening at 10 AM eastern time.

6
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:34,349
An announcement comes out, that B intends to acquire A at I don't know,

7
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:42,397
let's say that A right now is trading at 5 dollars a share, but a press release comes out that B

8
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:45,613
intends to acquire A at 10 dollars a share.

9
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,608
Let me right this down.

10
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:51,837
At 10 dollars per share.

11
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:55,710
So you can imagine, and they say they're going to do it with cash.

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,055
And we'll talk in future videos about how it becomes a little more involved if they were doing it with their own shares.

13
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:04,857
But they intend to do it with cash. So they're able to acquire A,

14
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:09,971
everyone who owns a share of company A will get 10 dollars for it

15
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:14,286
Those shares will go to company B. Company B will own company A all of a sudden.

16
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:19,471
So what do you think would happen to the stock of company A?

17
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:22,854
We know that B intends to buy it for 10 dollars a share.

18
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:27,639
Well you can imagine if everyone thought that this is definitely going to happen.

19
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:32,780
That anyone who holds the stock is going to get 10 dollars you can imagine that the stock

20
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,577
would just gap up immediately to something close to 10 dollars a share.

21
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:42,150
Something close to 10 dollars a share and not even trade much around it

22
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,984
because they know what they're going to get for it.

23
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:49,634
So this is if you knew that this merger or this acquisition was going to happen.

24
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:56,221
The reality is you don't now always just from this press release that B definetly will acquire A.

25
00:01:56,221 --> 00:02:00,900
Maybe they have to get approval from government bodies to make sure that they aren't getting

26
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,450
a monopoly here. Maybe they still have to get the funding from some bank, they still have to get a loan

27
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,249
in order to be able to do this deal, so there's somewhat, maybe something else happens,

28
00:02:09,249 --> 00:02:14,004
Maybe there's another bidder that wants to acquiere A and they're willing to pay more. So you don't now exactly

29
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:18,190
what's going to happen in this situation so you don't know for sure this is going to happen.

30
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:24,735
So what does normally happen is that instead of going all the way up it goes some place in between.

31
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:29,115
So in reality instead of jumping from 5 to 10 dollars it might jump from, I don't know,

32
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:36,034
5 to 8 dollars. And maybe it trades around here. And you might say why does it trade at 8 dollars?

33
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:42,764
And it would trade at 8 dollars so notice that there's a 100 percent chance it would trade all the way to 10 dollars.

34
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:47,987
Right? Because that's what stock A would be worth now because B is going to pay that. But if it trades at 8 dollars

35
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:57,353
essentially the market is saying that we're going to give you three fifths right? From 5 to 8 is 3 dollars

36
00:02:57,353 --> 00:03:02,622
So it's going to be three fifths of the total jump that it could have if there's a hundred percent chance.

37
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:10,399
Or another way to say it is that the market is saying there is a 60 percent chance that this merger will go through.

38
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:16,039
Any one who thinks that there's more than a 60 percent chance, it they do this over a bunch of security so that all the

39
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:20,606
probabilities are kinda worked out eventually, they should buy this security

40
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:27,759
because they could buy 8 and they think that it should really be worth 10. Any one who thinks that

41
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:34,302
No way that this acquisition is going to happen that they, B isn't going to get the financing or that the regulatory

42
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:39,982
authorities aren't going to allow B to do this then they should short the stock when it goes up here because if the

43
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:43,696
acquisition falls through then the stock is going to go back down here. It's gonna go

44
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:47,397
back down to the 5 dollar range before the announcement.

45
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:51,157
And so people, and specially hedge funds,

46
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:56,243
who act in this way based on they are thinking that the merger is more likely to ocur or less likely to ocur based on

47
00:03:56,243 --> 00:04:02,196
their reasearch or maybe they have some quantitative models or may they have some information other people don't have

48
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:08,496
that might be legal or might be otherwise they would place these bets; the people who think that the merger will happen

49
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:15,129
will buy expecting it to go to 10 dollars the people who think it won't they would short it expecting it to go

50
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:21,062
to 5 dollars. And this strategy of playing the probabilities of a merger happening this is called merger arbitrage.

51
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:26,788
Merger arb some times called for short. Merger arbitrage.

52
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:32,112
And it's arbitrage because someone who feels they know the merger is going to happen they can

53
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:38,295
buy some thing for 8 and then sell or they could buy some thing for 8 but it's going to be worth 10 dollars

54
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:42,379
they could sell it for 10 at some future date when B acquires the company.

55
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,648
Or if they know the merger isn't going to happen

56
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:53,827
they could short it for 8 and then buy it back for 5 dollars. Once again kind of doing an arbitrage on a prize differential.

57
00:04:53,827 --> 00:05:00,256
They think some thing that is worth 5 is trading at 8 on the downside, and on the upside they think that something that is trading at 8 is worth 10.
