1
00:00:01,059 --> 00:00:02,350
In the last couple of videos

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,651
we figured out the electron configurations for atoms

3
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:09,937
that only had electrons in the S and P subshells.

4
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:11,979
and so we have this obvious problem

5
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,348
we also have the D subshell

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,574
which we'll talk about here with these bizarre shapes

7
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:19,491
And eventually we even get into the F subshells

8
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:21,742
which are these really kinda exotic looking shapes

9
00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:22,607
and these shapes

10
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:24,050
they're interesting to look at and think about.

11
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,561
but they're not as important

12
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:27,524
for actually figuring out the configuration.

13
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:29,303
so the question arises

14
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:30,541
what happens when we start

15
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,747
going to the D and F subshells.

16
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:35,767
The general way to think about it

17
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:37,661
is the energy shell you're in

18
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:39,199
is equivelant to the period,

19
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:41,168
we are in the periodic table

20
00:00:41,168 --> 00:00:43,876
so if we were to do... so just it all fits on one page...

21
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,927
the periods would appear here on the left

22
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:47,516
but then I wouldn't be able to finish the whole table

23
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:49,590
So this is period one

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,704
let me write this in a darker color.

25
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:57,740
Period one, two, three, four, five, six

26
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,419
I think I barely am fitting on the page.

27
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:02,374
So each row is a period

28
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:05,198
and then for the porposes of

29
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,965
figuring out the electron configuration

30
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:08,920
we did this in the last video

31
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,666
we want to put helium

32
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,880
let me just copy and paste exactly helium

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,527
we want to put Helium in the S block

34
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:22,036
so we want to put Helium right there

35
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:23,994
the reason why, just in case you are curios of

36
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:27,230
why Helium is put there in the periodic table

37
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,562
is because it has very similar properties

38
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:33,534
to the other elements in this columns or this group

39
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:34,800
each column is called a group

40
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,004
and we'll talk about valence electrons

41
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,406
and why that leads to different properties

42
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:41,310
but for electron configuration purposes

43
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,856
we can put it in the S block

44
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:44,193
and that's not too hard to remember

45
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:45,339
beacuse it's just one element

46
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,559
and it kind of makes sense，1s1, 1s2, etc.

47
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:50,567
All you do is draw blocks around them

48
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:53,713
so, see, this is - I said multiple times already that

49
00:01:53,713 --> 00:02:00,457
this is - this right here is the S block

50
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:04,838
this over here on the right is the P block

51
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:07,007
that's the P block

52
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:11,668
And then this in the middle right here is the D block.

53
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:18,569
this is the D block.

54
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,416
and so if you want to figure out

55
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:23,405
the electron configuration of any atom

56
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:25,314
you just have to... the way you think about it..

57
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:27,924
they fill in this order, but when you say..

58
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:29,417
Let's say this, this,

59
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:32,011
you know when you go from Calcium:

60
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:35,026
Clacium would have filled out the 4s2 right?

61
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:38,608
4s1, 4s2, so if I just do it's 4th energy shell

62
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:39,439
it looks like this.

63
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:46,154
Calcium is: 4s2..

64
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:48,765
and the you start filling the D block, right?

65
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:51,855
Oh, what did I say? I wanted to do... so that's Calcium

66
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:52,653
instead I wanted to write

67
00:02:52,653 --> 00:02:55,113
the electron configuration for iron

68
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:57,134
which is in the D block

69
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,714
so turns out

70
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:00,076
and this is kind of an artifact

71
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:03,483
and I'll do a more detailed video on this in the future

72
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,666
that it actually goes and backfills the 3rd energy shell

73
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,632
because all of the sudden

74
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:10,374
the D orbitals can kind of fit in

75
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:12,687
the gaps of the 3rd energy shell

76
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:15,610
so what you do is you go one energy shell above it

77
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,290
So whatever period you are in in the d block

78
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,746
you go one minus that.

79
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:24,087
Sorry, you go that period minus one

80
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,950
to figure out what energy shell the D block is filling

81
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,359
so iron has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 elements in the D block.

82
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:35,399
so it's going to have d6,

83
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:42,989
but it's not going to do 4d6. It's going to be 3d6

84
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,060
And I figured that out because

85
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,886
it's in the fourth period and I subtracted one from that.

86
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:49,048
so this is kind of the

87
00:03:49,048 --> 00:03:53,366
highest energy 8 electrons in iron.

88
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,711
4s2, 3d6.

89
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,496
If I said what are the electrons

90
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:00,702
that are in the outer-most energy shell

91
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:03,353
I would say that there are two electrons

92
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,650
in the outer-most energy shell for iron.

93
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,375
But if I were to say

94
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,379
which energy shell has the highest energy electrons?

95
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,404
It would be these.

96
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:12,057
Let me actually do the

97
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:14,678
whole electron configuration for...

98
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:17,321
let me pick up another one...

99
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:23,868
let me take, this is Copper right here.

100
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:27,846
Let me do Copper.

101
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:30,297
So the most, the highest, energy electrons

102
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:37,042
it has are going to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

103
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:37,964
Actually let me not do copper

104
00:04:37,964 --> 00:04:38,857
because copper does something

105
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:40,602
very interesting in real life

106
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:42,492
it's one of the few things

107
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,117
that kind of is a special case,

108
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,835
so let me do a different one, let me do ...

109
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:52,725
let me do the whole thing for iron.

110
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,311
Sorry to be waffling around so much.

111
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:55,356
If you want to do the entire

112
00:04:55,356 --> 00:04:57,384
electron configuration for iron

113
00:04:57,384 --> 00:05:01,979
it would be 1s2. That‘s the first energy shell

114
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:02,714
now the second,

115
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:06,109
let me do that in magenta, right there.

116
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:13,731
1s2, and then in orange you have 2s2

117
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:17,581
and then you have 6 in the P section right there

118
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:20,230
so 2p6.

119
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,667
Now we are in the third energy shell.

120
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,121
The third energy shell

121
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:26,754
let me go switch to this bluish color.

122
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:32,303
So then I fill up 3s2, remember this is the S block,

123
00:05:32,303 --> 00:05:37,580
then I fill out 3p6.

124
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,815
fill out those right there: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

125
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:46,449
now I'm going to add these electrons, then I add...

126
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,721
let me pick a nice green.

127
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:51,357
Then I go to 4s2.

128
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:53,858
So it's 4s2.

129
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:55,673
And now this was the interesting thing,

130
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:57,314
you know, the D block is interesting

131
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:59,666
Now I fill out another D block,

132
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:04,041
or my first D block: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

133
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,108
but it won't be in the 4th energy shell.

134
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,445
It will be in the 4th minus one energy shell:

135
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:09,944
it will be in the 3rd energy shell

136
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,483
so this will go to 3d6

137
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:13,674
just like we did at the beginning of the video

138
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,433
and so the 3rd energy shell.

139
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,829
So I would actually write it here.

140
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:21,183
I could write it, if I wanted to write.. 3d6.

141
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,856
So if I wanted to write things in order of

142
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:24,569
which energy shell they are

143
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:25,595
I could have wirtten it this way

144
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,736
If I wanted to write it in order of

145
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:29,554
the highest energy electron...

146
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:30,844
remember the shells are kind of

147
00:06:30,844 --> 00:06:31,715
the best way to visualize

148
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,762
how far away we are from the nucleus,

149
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:35,090
so, in this case,

150
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,690
these higher energy electorns

151
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,124
are going to be further in the nucleus

152
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:40,128
even though they take..

153
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:43,508
it's a higher energy state to be in.

154
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:46,104
If I did it in terms of energy state

155
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:47,793
I could rearrange these two

156
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:49,288
but in most of chemistry

157
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:51,541
what matters is what's in the outter shell

158
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,961
so it's interesting that

159
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:55,386
although with filled outer 4s2 here

160
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:57,266
and then we kept adding more and more electrons,

161
00:06:57,266 --> 00:07:00,570
those electrons where just filling a lower energy shell,

162
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,134
so if we.. in this atom, in case of Iron,

163
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,575
when we talk about the electrons

164
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:07,929
in this outer energy shell

165
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,789
and thoses are called the Valence Electrons

166
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:11,599
and these are the ones that react.

167
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,769
These are called Valence...

168
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,271
let me use a better color...

169
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:17,594
Valence Electrons.

170
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:21,745
This iron has 2 valence electrons,

171
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,560
because the outer shell is 4s2.

172
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,019
Even though it had these...

173
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,161
even after filling 4s2 it had 6 more electrons.

174
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:31,991
but those kind of backfilled the third energy shell

175
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:33,860
so that's one way, and than you might say:

176
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,104
oh well what happens when we go to the F shell?

177
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:38,298
Or the F block?

178
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:39,637
So that's these down here..

179
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:41,627
In a lot of periodic tables

180
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,091
you see these Lanthanoids and Actinoids down here

181
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,315
and they are supposed to fill in the gap right here

182
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:47,701
and that might be a little hard to visualize

183
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,492
and I'll show you why they do this.

184
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:51,348
You could just as easily made a periodic table

185
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:53,390
that looks like this.

186
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,804
where you insert them in,

187
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:56,483
you push everything to the right

188
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:57,940
and you insert these in

189
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,302
but obviously this kind of periodic table

190
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:01,830
is a lot harder to fit in

191
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,590
you could have done the same thing

192
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,723
with the D block actually

193
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:09,188
This one is the S block, this is the F block

194
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:13,831
and this is the D block

195
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:17,967
and then this is the P block right here.

196
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,830
when we are dealing with the F block,

197
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,598
so let's say we wanted to figure out..

198
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:23,882
I don't even know what element this is...

199
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:28,639
the electron configuration for this atomic symbol La

200
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,011
So it first it's filling out...

201
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,917
this last incremental electron fills the F block.

202
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:43,484
So it's F - let me do it in a lower case.

203
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:46,919
It has one in the F orbital,

204
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,332
and this is the 6th period

205
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:50,774
but with the F block you subtract two.

206
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:56,853
You subtract 2 from it so it'll be 4f1, and then 6s2.

207
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:59,469
The S block you just look at the period, 6s2

208
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:02,585
And then if you were to keep going back

209
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:07,257
you would then go to 5p6

210
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:11,630
so then it would be 5p6

211
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,730
and then it would fill out these 10

212
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,600
in the D block right there that are in the 5th period

213
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,591
but remember you subtract one from the D block

214
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:26,832
so it'd be 4d10

215
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:31,518
and then it's 5s2

216
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:33,634
and you just keep going back that way,

217
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:35,353
and it seems complicated at first but just remember

218
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:37,019
when you are in the S or the P block

219
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,387
you just look at the period you are in

220
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:40,875
but then when you start filling the D block

221
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:46,109
it fills in a subshell that's one lower

222
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:48,017
and when you start fillng the F block

223
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:49,822
which are these really large elements

224
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:54,017
you start fillng a subshell that is two lower

225
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:55,106
so maybe in the next video

226
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:57,062
I'll do a couple of these electron configurations

227
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:58,271
because I think I'm already out of time

228
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,621
and I'll actually show another way to figure this out

229
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:02,777
that's often covered in some chemistry classes.

230
00:10:02,777 --> 99:59:59,999
See you soon.
