1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see if we can understand a thing or two

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about Futures Curves

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I've drawn two futures curves here

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and really all they show is the different

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
settlement prices for the different delivery dates of futures

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's say that this orange curve is one of them

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what this says is, if "today" for delivery today

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we wanted to buy or sell an apple the market rate is $0.10/lb so this isn't

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the futures contract at all this is called the spot price it's essentially

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
called the market price for that commodity

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or that security today we're just using the example of apples

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this tells us at time "0" you can buy or sell an apple

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
based on the current market for $0.10

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now when we move to "1" the way I've labelled

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this axis this says 1-month from now

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is not saying that the market price is going

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to go up 1-month from now

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you go to the futures market and say

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to sell or I want to buy apples
