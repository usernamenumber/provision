99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are at the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and we're looking at four of over thirty canvases that Monet made

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of Rouen Cathedral, which is a little more than an hour drive north of Paris.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Over two late winters and early springs of 1982 and 1893 he rented a space across from the Cathedral

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and painted the Cathedral in different effects of light.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so what he did was he had several canvases going at once - each for a different

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
moment of the day and different effect of light.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, that makes sense. If Monet is trying to define this ephemeral quality of light,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then as the Sun moves, he would need to change canvases - he can't paint that fast.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then he would come back to it, day after day. But in the also different weather effects

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and having this temporary studio across the street allowed him to paint the rain early in the morning, etc.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then, I think, he brought them all back to Paris and finished them in the studios.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They are really heavily raught and there's a lot of paint on this canvases,

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so this is not something that was done quickly.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Monet was always interested in capturing the fleeting effects of something that he saw,

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but here it's become the exact subject of the painting.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The irony is that as he's capturing something that's fleeting, he takes longer

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and longer to paint it

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and to finish it, not outside, but to finish it in the studio.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is another irony here, which is -

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if the subject is really about light and the way light constructs form,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I think that really is the subject, he's picked a pretty thing to render it on,

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is the Cathedral, which is all its religious connotations its historical connotations

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and is solid in the extreme and yet, in a rendering by Monet, there are not

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
such solid forms.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
No. They really appear very light, almost filigree forms, they've lack a sense of

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
heavy three-dimensionality.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The subject of a Gothic cathedral is divine light itself.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, why would he be interested in a just formal sense of a gothic cathedral

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I always thought that it had to do with enormous complexity of the surface.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's not doubt that it's the complexity of light and shadow on the facade

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of a cathedral like Rouen Cathedral, that was appealing to him.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But I don't think it's simply because the gothic church has a fabulous facade.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean, he's choosing something very identified with France, the gothic style...

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there feels for me like there's something nationalistic here, there feels to me

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like there's something poignant here.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I mean, let's face it. You know, we've had Darvin, and things are really different

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in late 19-th century.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is taking that grand history, taking all of the power of this function symbolicly

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and, in a sense, understanding them through the lands of the late 19-th century.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think so. They're meant to be seen together, and he exhibited them together

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and not that he ever exhibited them all together, but they are certainly

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
meant to be seen at least in groups. And they're really beautiful.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And one really does get that sense of optical effects of different times of day -

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the morning mist, the sun coming out, the heat of the afternoon sun...

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What happens to my eyes as I move across the canvases is different parts of

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the Cathedral protrude and recedes in different ways in different light.
