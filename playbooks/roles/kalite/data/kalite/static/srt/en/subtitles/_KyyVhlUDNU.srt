1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,390
Now that we have a little bit
of a review of oxidation and

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,840
reduction under our belts, let's
see if we can apply what

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,330
we now, maybe, re-understand
to cellular respiration.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,650
So cellular respiration, for
every mole of a glucose,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,960
C6H12O6, we combine that--
and maybe that's

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,040
in an aqueous state.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,560
It's dissolved in water.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,110
We combine that with six moles
of molecular oxygen.

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,990
And then our cells perform
cellular respiration in a

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,150
whole series of steps.

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,550
And I'll do more
videos on that.

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,470
   

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,780
I'll just abbreviate it.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,520
And then we end up with six
moles of carbon dioxide.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,720
We have to breathe this oxygen
in order to perform cellular

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,650
respiration and we have to
breathe this carbon dioxide

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,710
out because it's just a
byproduct of cellular

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,630
respiration.

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,900
Six moles of carbon dioxide,
six moles of water.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,450
And the whole point of cellular
respiration is, plus

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,400
some energy is generated
by this reaction.

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,630
And our bodies store
this energy.

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,890
Well, some of it is just
turned into heat.

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,150
But the whole point of cellular
respiration is to

26
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,650
store it as 38 ATPs, which we've
learned already is the

27
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,160
energy currency of biological
systems.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,080
And then our bodies, or
biological systems in general,

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,350
can use these ATPs to contract
muscles or generate nerve

30
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,500
impulses or grow cells or divide
cells or whatever else

31
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,300
that a biological system
has to do.

32
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,790
In the last video we learned a
little bit about oxidation and

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,060
reduction, so let's apply
those ideas here.

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,510
Now we saw in the last video
that a chemist would say-- let

35
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,810
me write it this way-- a
chemist would say that

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,510
oxidation means losing
electrons, or not being able

37
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,760
to hog them.

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,150
   

39
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,160
While a chemist will
tell you that

40
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,310
reduction is gaining electrons.

41
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:12,020
   

42
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,460
And if you have trouble
remembering, oxidation is

43
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,680
losing, that's kind of OIL,
that's the mnemonic.

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,240
Oxygen is losing electrons.

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,490
Reduction is gaining.

46
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,060
Or, RIG.

47
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,060
So OIL RIG.

48
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,760
This is what you learned
in chemistry class.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,900
Now biologists or biochemists
will say, oh, well, you know I

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,220
like to define it a little
bit differently.

51
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:40,540
A biologist will say that
oxidation is losing hydrogen

52
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:52,660
atoms. And they'll say reduction
is gaining hydrogen

53
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,730
atoms. And we saw in the last
video that this definition is

54
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,940
actually hard when you're
applying it to hydrogen

55
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,150
because it's not like a hydrogen
atom can lose itself

56
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,670
or gain itself.

57
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,870
And the reason why we said
that these two ideas are

58
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,200
consistent is because if I'm
talking about a carbon and a

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,530
carbon is losing a hydrogen.

60
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,900
So let's say I have some
compound that looks like this.

61
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,540
Maybe it's connected to a
bunch of other things

62
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,530
someplace else.

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,800
And then later on the carbon--
let's say I have a carbon that

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,910
looks like that and I have an
oxygen that's maybe bound to

65
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,710
another oxygen.

66
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,020
I'm doing a very kind of
hand-wavy explanation here.

67
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,180
And maybe that oxygen is bonded
to something else.

68
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,730
This is what I start off with.

69
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,130
And on the other side of this
equation I end up with

70
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,910
something that looks
like this.

71
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,760
Where a carbon is bonded
to an oxygen.

72
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,600
And maybe that other oxygen is
bonded to this hydrogen.

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,890
The biologist will say, oh, this
carbon has been oxidized

74
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,590
because it lost its hydrogen.

75
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,590
The hydrogen went from here--
I'll do it in a different

76
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,120
color-- went from this carbon
to this oxygen.

77
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,870
And the biologist would
also say that this

78
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,540
oxygen has been reduced.

79
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,510
It's been reduced because
it gained hydrogens.

80
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,650
But the reality, or maybe the
chemists' definition, which I

81
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,820
like a little bit more is, over
here because carbon is

82
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,360
more electronegative, we
see carbon is much more

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,440
electronegative than hydrogen.

84
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,829
And oxygen is even more
electronegative than carbon.

85
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,070
When any of these guys bond with
hydrogen they're going to

86
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,860
hog the electron.

87
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,170
So here, carbon got to
hog the electron.

88
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:31,740
So here, carbon hogs
electrons.

89
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,200
While here, carbon gets its
electrons hogged by oxygen.

90
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,610
So here, oxygen hogs.

91
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,840
   

92
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,850
So by losing the hydrogen, the
carbon actually lost its

93
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,570
opportunity to hog electrons.

94
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,930
And since it ended up bonding
with an oxygen, it not only

95
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,610
can't hog hydrogen's electrons
but then it gets its electrons

96
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,860
hogged by an even more
electronegative atom.

97
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,920
So that's why these two
definitions are consistent.

98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,150
Same thing with the oxygen.

99
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,695
Here it's bonding with another
oxygen, not hogging anything.

100
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:04,130
But when it gains the hydrogen
it's able to

101
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,020
hog hydrogen's electrons.

102
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,290
Because it's so much more
electronegative.

103
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,840
Or you could say that it's
gaining electrons.

104
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,860
So that's why these two
definitions are somewhat

105
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,370
consistent.

106
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,270
Although sometimes they fall
apart if we're not dealing

107
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,910
with hydrogen.

108
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,080
The chemistry definition applies
more consistently to

109
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,660
everything.

110
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,190
But sometimes the biologists'
definition is easier to kind

111
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,850
of glance at.

112
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,210
Or you'll actually see it
written in textbooks.

113
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,650
So let's go back to cellular
respiration and try to figure

114
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,890
out what's being oxidized
and reduced.

115
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,000
So if we look over here.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,160
Over here we have our glucose.

117
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,610
And actually I copied and
pasted from Wikipedia a

118
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,305
glucose molecule.

119
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:42,405
And actually there's
one error here.

120
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:44,060
And maybe I should edit
it on Wikipedia.

121
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,830
There should be another hydrogen
bonded to that carbon

122
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,720
right there.

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
But as you see, all of the
hydrogens, they're either

124
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,870
bonded to an oxygen or
a carbon over here.

125
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,430
On the left-hand side, they're
either bonded to

126
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,030
an oxygen or a carbon.

127
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,760
If we were to write its
oxidation state, in every case

128
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,580
it's bonded to something that's
more electronegative.

129
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,060
So it's going to be giving
up its electrons.

130
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,710
So it will have a plus
one oxidation state.

131
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,880
And oxygen, in every case,
is either bonded to

132
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
a carbon or a hydrogen.

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,870
And so, oxygen, if it's bonded
to a carbon or a hydrogen, is

134
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,520
going to hog an electron from
either one of those guys.

135
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,010
So in every situation in
glucose, oxygen has a two

136
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,940
minus or a minus two
oxidation state.

137
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,090
And carbon, since this whole
thing is neutral, one would

138
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,080
think that carbon would have
a neutral oxidation state.

139
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,030
And if you go through this, you
actually find that most of

140
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,140
these carbons do have neutral
oxidation states.

141
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,080
Let me circle a few.

142
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,710
So for example, this carbon
right here, it's hogging an

143
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,500
electron from this hydrogen.

144
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,210
But then it gets an electron
hogged by this oxygen.

145
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,760
And then of course it does
nothing with the carbon.

146
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,850
So that's neutral.

147
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,710
This is neutral for
the same reason.

148
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,810
This is neutral for
the same reason.

149
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,330
This one is also neutral
for the same reason.

150
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,130
It's bonded with two carbons.

151
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,930
It has an electron
hogged by oxygen.

152
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,360
But then it hogs an electron
from hydrogen.

153
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,420
So it's neutral.

154
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,370
So four of these carbons
are neutral.

155
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,100
This carbon right here has two
electrons hogged by oxygens.

156
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,910
And then it gets to take one
back from the hydrogen.

157
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,760
So it has a plus one
oxidation state.

158
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,410
This one is the opposite.

159
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,520
It has two hydrogens
that it hogs from.

160
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,940
Then it has to give one
away to the oxygen.

161
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,340
So this has a minus one.

162
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,870
So these two cancel out.

163
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,120
On average, you can say that the
carbons in glucose have a

164
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,910
neutral oxidation state.

165
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,580
And I'm dealing with the
chemist definition.

166
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,750
And I'm going to show you
that they're essentially

167
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,920
equivalent.

168
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,210
Here all of the oxygens have
no oxidation state.

169
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,940
Because they're just bonded.

170
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,420
Let me do it in a
better color.

171
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,500
No oxidation state or neutral
oxidation state because

172
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,690
they're double bonded
with oxygen.

173
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,850
No one's hogging from anyone.

174
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,800
They're obviously equally
electronegative.

175
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,020
If we look at the
products, carbon

176
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,340
dioxide looks like this.

177
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,050
So, in either of these cases,
oxygen is hogging two

178
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,810
electrons from this carbon.

179
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,990
So it has a minus two
oxygen state.

180
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,445
This oxygen is hogging two
electrons from carbon.

181
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,600
So it has a minus two
oxidation state.

182
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,480
And this carbon is getting all
of its valence electrons, all

183
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,960
four, hogged by the oxygen.

184
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,060
So it has a plus four
oxidation state.

185
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,380
It's lost four electrons,
you can imagine.

186
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,580
Because it's getting hogged.

187
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,300
So that's carbon.

188
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,950
So we could write this as four
plus for the carbon.

189
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,160
And then each oxygen
has a two minus.

190
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,190
And we can do the math later
on to figure out

191
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,360
what the total is.

192
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,669
And then, if we look at the
water-- we've looked at this

193
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,239
before-- the oxygen is hogging
two electrons,

194
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:39,020
one from each hydrogen.

195
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,789
So two minus.

196
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,990
And then each of the hydrogens
have a plus

197
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,010
one oxidation state.

198
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,800
So if you want to do a half
reaction for cellular

199
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,710
respiration, and in the
chemists' sense of things,

200
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,140
just dealing with electrons,
you can immediately say, I

201
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,190
start with 12 hydrogens
on this side.

202
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,760
Let me just write it this way.

203
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,030
So H12 on this side.

204
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,090
They all have a plus one
oxidation state.

205
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,360
And then cellular respiration
occurs.

206
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,890
And now I have 12 hydrogens.

207
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,440
I could write the 12 a little
bit differently here.

208
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,100
But they still have
a plus one.

209
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,770
Each of them still has a plus
one oxidation state.

210
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,870
So nothing from an oxidation
reduction point of view

211
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,680
happens to the hydrogen.

212
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,150
Now if we do the carbon.

213
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,060
   

214
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,650
On the left-hand side of the
equation, we have six carbons.

215
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,810
They have a neutral
oxidation state.

216
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,220
But then on the right-hand
side of the

217
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,900
equation, what happens?

218
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,300
I now have six carbons.

219
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,660
Written a little bit
differently.

220
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,165
But I have six carbons.

221
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:41,210
And they each have a plus
four oxidation state.

222
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,350
Which means that they have
lost four electrons.

223
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,880
Or their hypothetical charge,
by losing those four

224
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,740
electrons, has gone
up by four.

225
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,320
Because they're losing
negatively charged electrons.

226
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,800
So the six carbons, after
cellular respiration, end up

227
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,630
with six oxidized carbons,
with plus

228
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,360
four oxidation states.

229
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,390
Plus-- so each of these
lost four electrons.

230
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,600
We have six of them.

231
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,500
4 times 6 is 24 electrons.

232
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,190
These are the electrons that the
carbon lost. So we see in

233
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,730
cellular respiration that
the carbon is oxidized.

234
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,340
   

235
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,490
Oxidation is losing electrons.

236
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,620
We see in cellular respiration,
we draw the half

237
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,490
reaction, carbon is losing, the
six carbons are losing a

238
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,640
collective 24 electrons.

239
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,320
And then finally, if I were to
do the oxygen on this side.

240
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,890
I've lost my equation up here.

241
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,670
So over here I have
two oxygens.

242
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,300
And I'm going to draw them
a little bit separate.

243
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,540
So I have these six oxygens
here that have a minus two

244
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,290
oxidation state.

245
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,050
On the left-hand side.

246
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,040
So I'll draw it like this.

247
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,580
They have a minus two
oxidation state.

248
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,200
And then I have these
12 oxygens that

249
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,450
are completely neutral.

250
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,630
   

251
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,410
So I won't even write an
oxidation state or oxidation

252
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,430
number there.

253
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,930
And then after we
perform cellular

254
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,540
respiration, what happens?

255
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,400
Well now I have, in the carbon
dioxide, I have 12 carbons

256
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,280
that have a minus two
oxidation state.

257
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,030
Six times O2.

258
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,350
So let me write that down
from the carbon dioxide.

259
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,940
So I have six O2s that
all have a to

260
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,210
minus oxidation state.

261
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,990
And then I have another six
oxygens that have a minus two

262
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,900
oxidation state.

263
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,980
So plus six oxygens that have
a minus two oxidation state.

264
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,820
So if you think about it, over
here I had a collective

265
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,770
oxidation state on all
of the oxygens.

266
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,380
These were neutral.

267
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,730
I have 6 times minus 2,
that's a minus 12.

268
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,870
You can kind of view it
as collective charge

269
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,680
of all six of them.

270
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,840
6 times minus 2.

271
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,490
Here I have 6 times minus
2, which is minus 12.

272
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,270
And then I have 6 times 2
oxygens per molecule.

273
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,500
So that's 12 times minus 2.

274
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,280
That's minus 24.

275
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,060
So to go from a minus 12 to a
total oxidation or kind of

276
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,850
hypothetical charge of
minus 36, I must

277
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,790
have gained 24 electrons.

278
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,690
And those 24 electrons that
I gained, that the oxygens

279
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,070
gained, are the same 24
electrons that the carbons

280
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,600
lost. So from the chemistry
point of

281
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,210
view, it's very clear.

282
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,750
Carbon was oxidized.

283
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:41,120
And oxygen, which gained
electrons-- RIG.

284
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,760
Reduction is gaining.

285
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,160
Oxygen is reduced.

286
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,240
And this is all a
bit of review.

287
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,740
But it's nice to see it in
the context of cellular

288
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,580
respiration.

289
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,120
And this actually kind of
answers one of the questions

290
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,060
of where does this
energy come from?

291
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,860
In any of these chemical
reactions, when you see energy

292
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,340
being produced, it's because
electrons are going from a

293
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,120
higher energy state to
a lower energy state.

294
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,620
If I have an electron that's up
here in a high energy state

295
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,710
and it is able to go to a more
comfortable state, lower

296
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,850
orbital or lower
energy orbital.

297
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,840
So low energy or more
stable energy state.

298
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,250
It'll generate energy in the
form of heat, or maybe this

299
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,770
can do some work in some way,
help make ATP molecules.

300
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,200
And so when you see these half
reactions, you see these 24

301
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,550
electrons, that are being
lost by carbon,

302
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,540
carbon is being oxidized.

303
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,690
And they're going to oxygen.

304
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,590
They're going in a whole
series of steps.

305
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,880
It's not just happening
in one huge explosion.

306
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,070
It's happening over a huge
series of steps.

307
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,550
And as it does that, it's
entering lower and lower

308
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,620
energy states.

309
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,000
And as these electrons enter
the lower energy states,

310
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,700
essentially by going from the
carbons and being pushed to

311
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,730
the oxygens, that's where the
energy is coming from.

312
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,060
That's where the energy
to make the 38

313
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,590
ATPs is coming from.

314
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,550
So, so far we talked a little
bit about how a

315
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,890
chemist views oxidation.

316
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,620
I touched at the beginning of
the video of how a biologist

317
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,610
views oxidation.

318
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,990
And then we saw that cellular
respiration from a chemist's

319
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,810
point of view is clearly showing
that the carbon is

320
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,240
being oxidized.

321
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,730
It's losing electrons.

322
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,610
And that the oxygen
is being reduced.

323
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,190
It's gaining electrons.

324
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,530
It's being reduced.

325
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,760
That electrons are going from
this carbon and they're going,

326
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,100
essentially, to these
oxygens right here.

327
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,020
Now how does the biology
definition of our

328
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,770
position hold up?

329
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,580
Well here it holds
up pretty well.

330
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,920
Because you can imagine, over
here, all of the hydrogens in

331
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,490
the equation are associated
with glucose.

332
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,300
And so they're either bonded,
if you look at the structure

333
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,810
of glucose.

334
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,650
The hydrogens are either bonded
to carbons or oxygens.

335
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,350
So these are bonded to
carbons and oxygens.

336
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,620
And when you go on the
right-hand side of the

337
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,650
equation, all of the hydrogens
are only bonding with oxygen.

338
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,570
So net-net, carbon definitely
lost hydrogens.

339
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,130
And hydrogens and oxygen
definitely gained hydrogens.

340
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,560
Let me write that down.

341
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,740
We see in respiration, carbon
lost hydrogens.

342
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,760
   

343
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,463
And oxygen gained hydrogens.

344
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:21,660
   

345
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,020
And that's consistent.

346
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,030
Because we see that by losing
hydrogens we are being

347
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,970
oxidized from a biologist
point of view.

348
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,800
And by gaining hydrogens,
oxygen is being reduced.

349
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,120
And just so you can kind of
makes sense of this when you

350
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,280
see this-- and when I start
drawing out the mechanisms,

351
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,980
which I will hopefully not make
too hairy-- this process

352
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,790
of transferring these hydrogens
is facilitated by

353
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,480
molecules like NAD
plus and FAD.

354
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,180
And we'll see that.

355
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,600
But really, if we just want to
reconcile the two notions, as

356
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,520
the hydrogens are being
transferred from one

357
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,490
electronegative atom to another
electronegative atom,

358
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,480
what's really being transferred
is the opportunity

359
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,270
to hog electrons.

360
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,320
If carbon has the hydrogen, it
gets to hog the electrons.

361
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,670
But if that hydrogen goes from
the carbon-- and the whole

362
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,070
atom; not just the nucleus, but
the whole atom goes to the

363
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,110
oxygen-- now the oxygen
has gained that

364
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,530
electron that it can hog.

365
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,400
And carbon has lost
the electron.

366
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,220
So carbon has oxidized and
oxygen has been reduced.

367
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,760
And I mentioned this
in previous videos.

368
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,380
But probably the most confusing
thing about

369
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,840
oxidation is that you always
want to say, all right, that

370
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,200
must have something
to do with oxygen.

371
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,680
And it does.

372
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,120
The word really comes
from, what would

373
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,040
oxygen do to something?

374
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,680
So oxygen, when it bonds with
things, it loses, it takes

375
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,080
away their electrons.

376
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,520
Or, in a reaction, it'll often
take away the hydrogens.

377
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,920
It took away the hydrogens
from the

378
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,780
carbon in this situation.

379
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,510
So that's where the term
oxidation comes from.

380
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,130
But you don't have to have
oxygen anywhere in your

381
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,420
reaction for oxidation or
reduction to occur.

382
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,580
Anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably useful.

383
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,960
This was actually a huge pain
point for me when I learned, I

384
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,970
got comfortable with the
chemistry definition of

385
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,230
oxidation reduction.

386
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,970
And then all of a sudden you
open up your biology book and

387
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,970
they start talking about losing
and gaining hydrogens,

388
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,750
as opposed to electrons, and it
took me a while to really

389
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,470
reconcile these two notions.

390
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:07,693
