1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,790
You've probably heard the term
Ponzi scheme before, let me

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:09,810
write it down, and what we're
going to do in this video is

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,360
explain what it really is.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,050
You might have a sense it's some
type of scam, that you're

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,430
taking one person's money and
giving it to another, but

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,800
we're going to do a tangible
example of

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,290
how it actually works.

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,700
And right here, I have two
pictures of the probably the

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,530
two most famous perpetrators
of Ponzi schemes, this is

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,270
Charles Ponzi right here.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,820
It was obviously named after him
and then, more recently,

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,660
this is Bernie Madoff, who
pulled off probably the

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,310
longest-lasting and largest
Ponzi scheme of all time.

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,380
Who knows, maybe there's a
longer-lasting and larger one

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,640
out there that we have still
haven't figured out yet, but

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,130
this is the largest
one to date.

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,450
And Ponzi wasn't the first
person to come up with the

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,350
Ponzi scheme, but they decided
to name it after him because

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,890
he was the first person to
really make it famous.

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,420
This mugshot was taken in the
early 1900s when he was

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,560
finally caught for perpetrating
his scheme.

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,910
So how does it work?

24
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,600
So let's start with some
investors here.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,040
We could get rid of pictures
of these two gentlemen.

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,900
So let's say that I've got a
scheme, and what I'm going to

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,320
do is I'm going to set
up my investors, so

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,900
these are my investors.

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,960
And then, let's say, we have
several time periods.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,930
So we can see why the investors
think, at least

31
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,970
initially, that my scheme
is legitimate.

32
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,290
So, let's say, that this is the
time period, so we have

33
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,930
period one, maybe this is years,
year one, year two,

34
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,570
year three, year four,
year five.

35
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,100
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to write each investor--

36
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,970
I'm going to write down how
much money they think they

37
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,860
have with me, the person
operating the Ponzi scheme and

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,210
then I'll show you exactly how
much money I have and how I

39
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,140
can even get away with having
the first investors think that

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,640
I'm legitimate.

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,410
So let's say I have
investor A.

42
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,810
So this is going to be their
investor's perceived-- let me

43
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,720
do this in a different color--
investor's perceived holdings

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,130
or perceived value.

45
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,560
And over here, I'm going to
write total actual value.

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:29,220
   

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,310
So you can imagine, this is the
actual amount of cash that

48
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,000
I have. So we have the investor
A in blue, and let's

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,250
say in year one, he
gives me $10,000.

50
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,730
And I say I I've got a surefire
way of doubling his

51
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,860
money in the second year.

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,090
So in the second year, I
actually do nothing with the

53
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,760
money and you know, I might
actually be spending it on my

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,940
own yachts and you know, fancy
suits and whatnot.

55
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,040
But let's just say I'm just
keeping it in a bank account

56
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,520
so you know, he gives it to me,
$10,000 and I do nothing

57
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,020
with that money.

58
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,060
I don't even get
interest on it.

59
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,383
It's not even in a
bank account, I

60
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,490
stuff it into my mattress.

61
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,200
So the reality is, after a year,
it's still only $10,000,

62
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,360
but I promised him that I had
some type of a genius scheme

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,490
that could double his money
in a year, so I send him a

64
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,910
statement that says that his
$10,000 is now $20,000.

65
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,610
And I feel good about it because
I know that he's going

66
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,040
to be so excited that his money
doubled that he's going

67
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,300
to want to keep his money with
me, because he'll hope that it

68
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,400
can double again.

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,580
And not only is he going to do
that, but he's going to go to

70
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,310
the country club and show off
to all of his other friends

71
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,690
how he was able to do way better
than they did with

72
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,600
their investments.

73
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,290
So he's going to essentially
convince other

74
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,570
people to join in.

75
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,410
So let's say he convinces
investor B to join in.

76
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,830
Investor B looks at the
statement says, hey, this guy

77
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,542
running this-- well he doesn't
know it's a scheme, let's say

78
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:51,140
he says , Sal seems to know what
he's doing, he doubled

79
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,620
investor A's money in a year.

80
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,510
I'm going to give him a bunch of
money, let's say I'm going

81
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,890
to give him $15,000
in year two.

82
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,860
So how much total actual value
do I have in year two now?

83
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:13,040
I have the $10,000 from investor
A plus this $15,000,

84
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,089
so I have a total of $25,000.

85
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,279
This is the actual amount that
I have in my bank account,

86
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,720
assuming that I'm not
spending it on my

87
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,330
yacht or my fancy suits.

88
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,240
But the total perceived value,
let me write that down another

89
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:34,940
line, if everyone actually
wanted the amount of money

90
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,800
that they thought they
had back, I would

91
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,540
have to pay out $35,000.

92
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,520
But we know that's not going
to happen, because people

93
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,560
think I'm such a good investor,
they want their

94
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,650
money to ride as long
as possible.

95
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,450
So you already see
this discrepancy.

96
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,830
There's only $25,000 in this
little pile of money that I'm

97
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,160
collecting, but people think
that there should be $35,000.

98
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,770
This is their perceived value,
because the this guy thought

99
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,050
his money doubled, although it
didn't, it just sat there.

100
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,270
Now, let's say that the next
year I sent them statements

101
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,710
that say, look, I made
super-awesome investments

102
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,250
again, the money
doubled again.

103
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,140
So this guy's money, his
perceived value, he gets a

104
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,170
statement that says you
now have $40,000.

105
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,690
This guy down here, investor B,
gets a statement that says

106
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,920
you now have $30,000.

107
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,990
And then they go back to the
country club, and they get

108
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,120
investor C onboard.

109
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,680
They're like, look, both of us
have tried out this guy, he's

110
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,630
doubled our money two years in
a row for both of us, you

111
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,190
probably want in on
this as well.

112
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,610
And investor C is like yeah,
well you know, my two buddies,

113
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,200
they look like legitimate
guys, let me

114
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,720
put my money there.

115
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,160
Let's say it gets bigger every
time because that's usually

116
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,030
how these things go, you know,
you normally don't don't have

117
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,330
just three investors, you'll
have hundreds of investors.

118
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,810
And the more fake positive
returns you get, the more

119
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,750
people that want to put
their money in.

120
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,870
So investor C, let's
say he comes in

121
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,320
and he puts in $20,000.

122
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,750
So what's the reality?

123
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,470
Let's focus on it.

124
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,330
So there's a perception
on year 3, this guy

125
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,840
just put his $20,000.

126
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,840
A think he's got $40,000, B
thinks he has $30,000, so the

127
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,170
perceived value here's $40,000
plus $30,000, $70,000 plus

128
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,700
$20,000 is $90,000.

129
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,490
That's the perceived value.

130
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,200
But the actual value is just
going to be this $25,000 we

131
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,990
had in period two, assuming we
didn't spend the money or do

132
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,190
anything with it plus
the $20,000 that

133
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,310
this guy just deposited.

134
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,890
So the reality is $45,000.

135
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,700
Now let's say that as we go from
period three to period

136
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,900
four, or let's say right when
this guy gets his statement

137
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,790
for $40,000, and it's the exact
same time period that

138
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,200
this guy had put
in his $20,000.

139
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,520
Let's say person A, he says, you
know what, I felt like my

140
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,940
ride has gone long enough, I
don't want to test fate, let

141
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,960
me take my money out and you
might say, oh you the scheme

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,920
will be ruined, but it's going
to work because enough money

143
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,190
is coming in from new investors
to pay this guy off.

144
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,800
We now have $45,000 actual
value, even though the people

145
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,510
think there's $90,000.

146
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,710
So if this guy withdraws all
of his money, so if he

147
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,930
withdraws all of his money so
it goes to zero, I have the

148
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,680
cash to pay them.

149
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,000
I have $40,000 even though
people think there's $90,000.

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,720
So I subtract out $40,000 right
here, and there's only

151
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,880
$5,000 dollars left in the bank
account and since this

152
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,000
guy withdrew his money, the
perceived value-- this $40,000

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,830
is no longer there, I gave the
guy the cash-- the perceived

154
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,050
value now is $50,000.

155
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,740
So I essentially owe people
$50,000, investors B and C

156
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,220
think that they have $50,000
invested with me, but the

157
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,790
reality is that I only have
$5,000 in my bank account.

158
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,090
And probably a more realistic
reality is I was probably

159
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,730
spending a lot of this money on
my own little luxuries the

160
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,500
whole time.

161
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,880
But let's continue another way,
once again this guy, not

162
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,290
only did he double his money for
two years, they're all the

163
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,610
same country club.

164
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,820
This guy doubled his money
again, this guy just

165
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,670
invested his money.

166
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,140
And now this guy says, look,
the scheme is legitimate.

167
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,740
This legitimized the scheme
This is legit.

168
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,570
Because, look, I doubled my
money for two years and I was

169
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,410
able to withdraw the money.

170
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:24,450
   

171
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,540
So he was able to withdraw his
money, so when he goes back to

172
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,080
the country club, he gives this
guy and that guy more

173
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
conviction that this is
all on the up and up.

174
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,840
And then investor D will
probably jump in too and say,

175
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,640
wow, now that he's doubled money
two years in a row, I

176
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,549
see it's legitimate.

177
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,539
Investor A was able to withdraw
his money, I'll give

178
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,290
even more money, I'll
give $100,000.

179
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,140
Maybe this is a ton of
people who are now

180
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,740
going to put in a $100,000.

181
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,400
And then the next year, I
double the money again.

182
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,290
And obviously, I won't make it
exactly double, I'll make it,

183
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,790
you know 40% one year and 30%
percent the next year so

184
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,460
doesn't look too suspicious.

185
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,590
I want to make it look like real
returns, but for the sake

186
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,190
of our math, let's say
I double it again.

187
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,210
So now and we're in year four.

188
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,840
And this guy withdrew all of his
money, but investor B now

189
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,800
thinks he has $60,000.

190
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,990
Investor C thinks
he has $40,000.

191
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:23,890
And investor D thinks
he has $200,000.

192
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,330
Oh, and I forgot to put investor
D's deposit here.

193
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,230
So when he put a $100,000, I
only had $5,000 in my bank

194
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,100
account, but then if I add
$100,000 I'll now have

195
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,140
$105,000 in my bank account
after this guy comes in at,

196
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,830
you know, at the end of period
three, we can imagine.

197
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,130
And, with the perceived amount,
I owe is $150,000.

198
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,480
So the green is what happens
after D comes in, so these are

199
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,350
no longer valid.

200
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,220
But you can see that as more
money comes in, I have more

201
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,810
and more money to pay
out, even though

202
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,870
I'm not doing anything.

203
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,980
Even though all of these
returns are fake.

204
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,050
So now I actually have $105,000
even though people

205
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,810
think, well that's at the end of
period three, at the end of

206
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,470
period four, what
do people think?

207
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,760
People think that I have
$300,000 of holdings.

208
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,010
Let me write that down.

209
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,850
   

210
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,870
But the reality is I still only

211
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,610
have $105,000 of holdings.

212
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,610
This is the total
actual value.

213
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,750
But notice, if this guy or this
guy, some of the early

214
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,740
investors, wanted to pull out
some of their money, although

215
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,910
they probably don't want to,
because where else can you

216
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,310
double your money every year
and this guy already showed

217
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,930
that I'm good for paying
back the money.

218
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,070
But even if this guy or this guy
wanted to pull out their

219
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,030
money, I would be able to give
it to them because I have at

220
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,110
least enough for those
withdrawals.

221
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,390
Now, everything would be
ruined if everyone gets

222
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,720
freaked out or scared and if I
have mass withdrawals or if

223
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,170
more people withdraw money than
there is in the bank plus

224
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,240
the amount of money
that comes in.

225
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,500
So in order for a Ponzi scheme
to keep going, and Bernie

226
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,060
Madoff was able to do this for
very long time, you have to

227
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,250
have good, believable,
legitimate returns.

228
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,710
Although they're not legitimate,
they just need to

229
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,660
look legitimate.

230
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:19,970
So that you have more money
coming in that out.

231
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,480
And the whole point of the doing
this Ponzi scheme, if

232
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,050
you're a stylish criminal, isn't
just to keep the cash

233
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,780
there, you know, the $10,000
from one period to the next.

234
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,600
The whole point of it is to
take a lot of that for

235
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,260
yourself, for you to live off
of and put into some Swiss

236
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,870
bank account to be able
to escape the

237
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,580
country at some point.

238
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,610
Anyway, hopefully you found
that enjoyable.

239
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:41,866
