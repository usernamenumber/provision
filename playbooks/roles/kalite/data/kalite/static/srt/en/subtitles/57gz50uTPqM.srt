00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:04,667
In the last series of examples we go into month 2 with $100 of cash

2
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:08,707
and the way we set up the example we spend $200 in month 2

3
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:10,379
and what we've been doing so far is saying

4
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:15,720
"Oh! That gets us to a cash balance of negative $100 at the end of month 2"

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,039
It's a little unrealistic, I kept it simple here and allowed us to have a negative cash balance

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,867
just for simplicity, but usually you will not see a negative cash balance.

7
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:27,376
The fact that you have a negative cash balance and you're allowed to operate

8
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:30,720
essentially means that someone is lending you money,

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,739
so to make this example a little more realistic,

10
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:37,933
let's imagine a situation where in month 2 you only have $100.

11
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:41,800
The person you are catering for, that you're buying those $200 of supply for,

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,267
they're not going to pay you until next month, so you tell the people that you need to buy stuff from

13
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:51,267
"Look,I only have $100 dollars, I have this customer, I'm doing thec atering for him this month.

14
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:57,333
Can I pay $100 for it to you this month, and then maybe pay another $100 to you next month?"

15
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,302
And let's say that they agree to that. So on month 2, on a cash basis,

16
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:06,082
instead of spending $200, you're actually spending $100.

17
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:12,400
and then in month 3, you'll also spend $100.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:21,067
Now this will change your cash accounting numbers, this will now be -$100, and this would now be $500.

19
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:25,800
but the more important thing is how this can be accounted for in Accounts Payable.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,324
The fact that you essentially told your vendors, "even though you gave me $200 worth of stuff,

21
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:35,364
I'm only going to pay you $100 now and I'm going to give you $100 later"

22
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:38,987
That means that you've increased your Accounts Payable by $100.

23
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:43,816
You've increased this liability that you owe things to other people.

24
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:46,649
So let me add Accounts Payable over here.

25
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:54,823
I'll just write A period, so I don't have to write the whole thing.

26
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,553
Accounts Payable

27
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,742
And going into the period, you didn't have any Accounts Payable,

28
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:05,333
and then now that you're essentially borrowing $100 from your vendors,

29
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,585
you're allowing to push back when you pay them,

30
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:12,000
you now have an Accounts Payable of $100.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,733
and I'm not going to work it through on all of this stuff over here.

32
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:17,467
But let's see how that would have affected the income statesments and the balance sheet.

33
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,854
So over here you had another liability.

34
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,800
Accounts Payable is a liability

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,933
So you have an Accounts Payable liability of $100

36
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:33,067
sorry, at this point we had no Accounts Payable liability

37
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,575
and then after the end of the month

38
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:37,408
we have an Accounts Payable liability of $100.

39
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:41,400
We owe $100 to our vendors.

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,533
And our cash is now at $0

41
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:46,232
So notice, it still does not change our Equity.

42
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:50,736
We essentially added $100 cash, and we added a $100 liability

43
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:51,990
They cancel out

44
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,267
Now if you take this part over here all of the assets are $400,

45
00:02:56,267 --> 00:03:01,000
$400-$100 in Liabilities still gets you to $300 in Equity.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,990
But now the reconciliation is to go from $100 in cash to $0 in cash.

47
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,383
We're not allowing ourselves to go negative.

48
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:12,981
And the reason that we can do that is that we actually have a source of cash.

49
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:24,133
So let me erase that and then let's add a line right over here

50
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:29,374
so we can say Accounts Payable increase

51
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:31,733
and now this is a source of cash.

52
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,740
And it might not be obvious. We're increasing a liability.

53
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,919
But it's a source of cash because we don't have to use our own cash.

54
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,052
Increasing the Accounts Payable is allowing us to not use all of our cash

55
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:45,907
So we have an Accounts Payable increase of $100.

56
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:49,251
So this is a source of cash, so now the cash from operations:

57
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:53,059
$200 net income-$400+$100

58
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:57,533
This whole thing is now -$100 cash from operations

59
00:03:57,533 --> 00:04:00,667
so you start with $100, you use $100

60
00:04:00,667 --> 99:59:59,999
Our ending cash is now 0, and it all works out.
