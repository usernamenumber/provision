1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,110
We're on problem 27.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:08,080
They tell us if i is equal to
the square root of minus 1,

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:16,750
then what is 4 times i-- that's
an i-- times 6 times i?

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,330
Well, multiplication
is associative.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,780
You can switch the
order around.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,720
So this is the same thing as 4
times 6 times i times i, or

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,670
the same thing as 24 times
i squared, right?

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,010
If we square both sides of this,
you get i squared is

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,940
equal to negative 1.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,160
So this is 24 times
negative 1.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,220
So this is minus 24,
which is choice C.

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,550
Next problem, 28.

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,120
They want to know what
an equivalent

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,660
form of 3 plus i is.

16
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,830
A lot of times, people don't
like either when you have a

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,640
square root in the denominator
or they don't like it when you

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,950
have an a complex number
in the denominator.

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,300
A complex number is just
something that has part real

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,230
and part imaginary.

21
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,350
So the way you can do it with
this case is you multiply

22
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,270
times the conjugate
of this number.

23
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,450
I know that sounds like a fancy
word, but all it means

24
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,700
is you take the opposite
of the imaginary part.

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,950
So what's the conjugate?

26
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,220
   

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,610
Remember, the only way you
cannot change a fraction is if

28
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,220
you multiply the numerator and
the denominator by the same

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,540
thing, because then you're
multiplying by 1.

30
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,690
So what's the conjugate
of this?

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,980
The conjugate of 3 plus
i is 3 minus i.

32
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,480
You have to do 3 minus
i over 3 minus i.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,510
I'm doing that because when you
multiply a complex number

34
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,150
by its conjugate, you end up
actually with a real number.

35
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,010
Then you're going to end up with
a complex number up here.

36
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,050
A conjugate, all it means is
you keep the real part the

37
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,330
same, and you change the sign
on the imaginary part.

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,160
That's all that word means.

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,540
All right, now let's figure
out what this is equal to.

40
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,570
2 times 3, just same
distributive

41
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,440
properties as always.

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,740
Let me do it in green.

43
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,540
2 times 3 is 6.

44
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,240
2 times minus i is minus
2i, all of that over

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,790
3 times 3 is 9.

46
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,960
3 times minus i is minus 3i.

47
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,680
i times 3 is plus 3i.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,910
Then i times minus i, you can
view that as minus i squared.

49
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,190
   

50
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,930
Let's think about what
this is equal to.

51
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,390
Well, this plus 3i and the
minus 3i cancel out.

52
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,230
What's i squared?

53
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,360
Well, this is equal
to negative 1.

54
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,980
So you end up with a minus
of a negative 1.

55
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,360
Minus a negative
1 is a plus 1.

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,690
So you're left with 6 minus
2i over 9 plus 1 over 10.

57
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,250
Actually, we can reduce
this some.

58
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,880
We can divide the top
and the bottom by 2.

59
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,300
So that becomes 3
minus i over 5.

60
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,690
We just divided both the
numerator and the

61
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,340
denominator by 2.

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,730
That is choice B.

63
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,260
   

64
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,110
Problem 29, these go
fast. No systems of

65
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,060
equations and all that.

66
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,530
What is the product of the
complex numbers 3 plus

67
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,040
i and 3 minus i?

68
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,020
They just asked us that.

69
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,035
That was in the last problem.

70
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:28,740
When we multiplied 3 plus
i times 3 minus

71
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,740
i, what did we get?

72
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,440
We got 10.

73
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,110
We did this whole thing.

74
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,590
3 times 3 is 9.

75
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,800
We did the whole thing.

76
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,570
They're just repeating
the same question.

77
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,430
That equals 10.

78
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,170
That's choice B.

79
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,300
Rewind the video and see
what I did here.

80
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:48,010
3 times 3 is 9 times minus 3i
plus 3i minus i squared.

81
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,400
These terms cancel out and you
get a minus i squared, which

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
is minus negative 1.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,090
So you have 9 plus 1,
so that equals 10.

84
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,420
So that is choice B.

85
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,520
That's crazy.

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,220
They just gave us the same
problem twice in a row.

87
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:13,700
   

88
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,120
All right.

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,360
They're giving us more and more
imaginary problems. But

90
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,920
these are fun, especially if
they're going to repeat the

91
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,019
same question.

92
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,980
Problem 30, if i is equal to
the square root of negative

93
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,710
1-- well, I'll just keep writing
it because they keep

94
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,120
writing it.

95
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,190
It's good as a reminder. i is
equal to the square root of

96
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,860
negative 1 and a and b are
non-zero real numbers.

97
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,140
What is 1 over a plus bi?

98
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,490
Well, once again, if they kind
of want us to rewrite this,

99
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,980
they probably just want us to
get rid of the i's in the

100
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,410
denominator.

101
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,850
So we multiply times
the conjugate of

102
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,270
this complex number.

103
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,780
So we multiply times a plus
bi, the conjugate over the

104
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,580
conjugate, a plus bi.

105
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,330
The conjugate isn't
this whole thing.

106
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,570
The conjugate is
just a plus bi.

107
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,410
Oh sorry, we should be
multiplying times a minus bi.

108
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,860
a minus bi over a minus bi.

109
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,720
The conjugate of a plus bi,
just so you get the

110
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,940
terminology right, is
just the a minus bi.

111
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,490
But I'm doing a minus
bi over a minus bi.

112
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,150
So I'm not changing this
fraction because this

113
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,020
obviously is 1.

114
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,690
x over x is the same
thing as 1.

115
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,450
So let's see what this
is equal to.

116
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,350
Well, the numerator just becomes
a minus bi times 1,

117
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,840
which is a minus bi.

118
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,720
Then you have a times a,
which is a squared.

119
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,810
a times minus bi, so
it's minus abi.

120
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,830
Then you have bi times
a, which is plus abi.

121
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,800
I'll write it down here.

122
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,600
They cancel out.

123
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,450
Then you have bi
times minus bi.

124
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:48,830
So that's minus b squared
i squared.

125
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,420
These cancel out.

126
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:56,810
So you're left with a minus
bi over a squared

127
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,970
minus b squared i squared.

128
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,360
We know what i squared is.

129
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,970
i squared is equal
to negative 1.

130
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,970
You square both sides of that
and you get i squared is equal

131
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,470
to negative 1.

132
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,100
So if we multiply, this
becomes a negative 1.

133
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,990
But then this negative and this

134
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,100
negative, they cancel out.

135
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,270
You get a plus.

136
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,830
So then we get a minus bi over
a squared plus b squared.

137
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,980
That is choice B.

138
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,750
   

139
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,000
Next problem.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,100
   

141
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,510
All right, what are the
solutions to the equation x

142
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:46,140
squared plus 2x plus 2?

143
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,610
All right, now, if you see an
equation like this and you're

144
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,130
like, OK, let's see,
can I factor it?

145
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,130
Oh, that is equal to 0.

146
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,370
You say, OK, what number when
I multiple them equal 2 and

147
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,540
when I add them equal 2?

148
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,430
Well, that's a hard one.

149
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,720
Whenever you get stuck, the
easiest thing to do is just

150
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,540
use the quadratic equation,
just as a reminder.

151
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,260
   

152
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,400
If the equation is Ax squared
plus Bx plus C-- maybe I

153
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,750
should have done them all in in
capital letters-- is equal

154
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,560
to 0, the solution to this and
the proof of this we've done

155
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,805
in the Khan Academy, it comes
from completing the square,

156
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:26,580
but it's useful to memorize,
is negative B.

157
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,200
So the solutions are x are equal
to negative B plus or

158
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:37,710
minus the square root of B
squared minus 4AC, all

159
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,820
of that over 2A.

160
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,340
So in this case, what is A?

161
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,720
A is the coefficient
on x squared.

162
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,650
So A is equal to 1.

163
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,260
What is B?

164
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,590
B is the coefficient on x.

165
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,540
So B is equal to 2.

166
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,210
What is C?

167
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,410
C is just a constant term.

168
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,930
So C is equal to 2.

169
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,740
We could just solve like that,
just substitute these values.

170
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,780
So you get x is equal to minus
B, which is minus 2, plus or

171
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,170
minus the square root of
B squared, so that's 4,

172
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,230
minus 4 minus A.

173
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:20,080
So 4 minus 4 times A, 4 times
1, times 2, all of that--

174
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,100
that's an ugly looking radical--
all of that over 2A,

175
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,780
2 times 1 is 2.

176
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:29,760
So that equals, let's see, we
get minus 2 plus or minus the

177
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,929
square root of 4 minus--
this is 8, right?

178
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,240
4 times 1 times 2.

179
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:45,410
4 minus 8, which is minus 4, all
of that over 2, which is

180
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,990
equal to minus 2
plus or minus.

181
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,380
So the square root of minus 4,
we could rewrite that as the

182
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,210
square root of 4
times minus 1.

183
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,290
So that equals 2 plus or minus
the square root of 4 times the

184
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,960
square root of minus 1, all of
that over 2, which is equal to

185
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,750
minus 2 plus or minus-- the
square root of 4 is 2 and the

186
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,950
plus or minus is dealing with
positive or negative 2-- times

187
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,560
the square root of negative 1.

188
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,620
Well, we learned that's
i multiple times.

189
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,510
The square root of negative 1
is i, all of that over 2.

190
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,560
We can simplify this
a little bit.

191
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,750
I'll do it in a different color,
just because I've run

192
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,600
out of space at the
bottom here.

193
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,390
So this is equal to divide
everything by 2, you get

194
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,140
negative 1 plus or minus i.

195
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,770
Let's see what the
choices are.

196
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,520
That's choice C, because
negative 1 plus or minus i

197
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,660
could also be written as
negative 1 plus i as one value

198
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,670
for x, and then the other one
could be negative 1 minus i.

199
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,460
They separate it out.

200
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,010
They don't write plus or minus
in the actual problem.

201
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,760
I'm out of time.

202
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,860
I'll see you in the next video.
