00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,320
What I want to do in this video is prove to ourselves

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,989
that vertical angles really are equal to each other,

3
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:09,218
their measures are really equal to each other.

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:14,234
So let's have a line here and let's say that I have another line over there,

5
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:19,389
and let's call this point A, let's call this point B, point C,

6
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:23,568
let's call this D, and let's call this right over there E.

7
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:26,494
And so I'm just going to pick an arbitrary angle over here,

8
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:31,231
let's say angle CB --what is this, this looks like an F--

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:35,132
angle CBE. What I want to do is if I can prove that angle

10
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:39,126
CBE is always going to be equal to its vertical angle

11
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:42,655
--so, angle DBA-- then I'd prove that vertical angles

12
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:45,395
are always going to be equal, because this is just a generalilzable

13
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,299
case right over here.

14
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:56,076
So what I want to prove here is angle CBE is equal to, I could say

15
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:58,909
the measure of angle CBE --you will see it in different ways--

16
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:00,395
actually this time let me write it without measure

17
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:02,485
so that you get used to the different notations.

18
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:07,349
I will just say prove angle CBE is equal to angle DBA.

19
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:12,455
Is equal to angle DBA.

20
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:15,627
So the first thing we know...the first thing we know

21
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:17,392
so what do we know?

22
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:24,600
We know that angle CBE, and we know that angle DBC are supplementary

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,000
they are adjacent angles and their outer sides, both angles,

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,867
form a straight angle over here.

25
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:37,533
So we know that angle CBE and angle --so this is CBE--

26
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:45,133
and angle DBC are supplementary. I will just write "sup" for that.

27
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,754
They are supplementary.

28
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:53,375
Which means that angle CBE plus angle DBC

29
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:57,152
is equal to 180 degrees. Fair enough.

30
00:01:57,182 --> 00:02:01,298
We also know --so let me see this is CBE, this is what we care about

31
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:03,800
and we want to prove that this is equal to that--

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,733
we also know that angle DBA

33
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,000
--we know that this is DBA right over here--

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,933
we also know that angle DBA and angle DBC are supplementary

35
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:22,867
this angle and this angle are supplementary,

36
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:26,333
their outer sides form a straight angle, they are adjacent

37
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,133
so they are supplementary

38
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:33,733
which tells us that angle DBA, this angle right over here,

39
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:39,000
plus angle DBC, this angle over here, is going to be

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,467
equal to 180 degrees.

41
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:47,800
Now, from this top one, this top statement over here,

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,133
we can subtract angle DBC from both sides

43
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:59,933
and we get angle CBE is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC

44
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:02,067
that's this information right over here, I just put

45
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:04,000
the angle DBC on the right side

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
or subtracted it from both sides of the equation

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,333
and this right over here, if I do the exact same thing,

48
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,400
subtract angle DBC from both sides of the equation,

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,467
I get angle DBA is equal to 180 degrees

50
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,133
--let me scroll over to the right a little bit--

51
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:26,400
is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,200
So clearly, angle CBE is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,000
angle DBA is equal to 180 degrees minus angle DBC

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
so they are equal to each other!

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,200
They are both equal to the same thing

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,800
so we get, which is what we wanted to get,

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,067
angle CBE is equal to angle DBA.

58
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:53,667
Angle CBE, which is this angle right over here,

59
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,267
is equal to angle DBA

60
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:58,867
and sometimes you might see that shown like this;

61
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:01,533
so angle CBE, that's its measure, and you would say that

62
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,733
this measure right over here is the exact same amount.

63
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,087
And we have other vertical angles

64
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:08,754
whatever this measure is, and sometimes you will

65
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:10,733
see it with a double line like that,

66
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,267
that you can say that THAT is going to be the same

67
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:15,133
as whatever this angle right over here is.

68
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:17,667
You will see it written like that sometimes, I like to use colors

69
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:20,200
but not all books have the luxury of colors,

70
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,933
or sometimes you will even see it written like this

71
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,733
to show that they are the same angle;

72
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,333
this angle and this angle

73
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,333
--to show that these are different--

74
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,667
sometimes they will say that they are the same in this way.

75
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:33,498
This angle is equal to this vertical angle, is equal to its vertical

76
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:34,785
angle right over here

77
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:37,400
and that this angle is equal to this angle that is opposite

78
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,800
the intersection right over here.

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,333
What we have proved is the general case

80
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,133
because all I did here is I just did two general intersecting lines

81
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:47,800
I picked a random angle, and then I proved that it is equal

82
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,452
to the angle that is vertical to it.
