1
00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:08,971
We are in a Louvre and we are looking at painting by one of the David followers one of his students.

2
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:13,530
An artists whos name is quite long but is usually just shortened to Giordet

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,049
And the title of the paiting is "Sleep of Endymion" .

4
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:22,747
So this is an ancient myth and it speaks of a sheepard who was an ideal beauty.

5
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:27,360
And he got into an disagreement with godness Juno

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,060
Who as punishment put him into the 30 years long sleep.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,304
But rather kindly and to futher the story I guess doesn't have him age.

8
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:41,071
So he mantains his ideal beauty durning this 30 years sleep.

9
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:46,060
And in this sceen he is visited by the chase godness Diana.

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,204
She is the godness of the hunt and apparently was so in love with him

11
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:51,654
that she visited every night.

12
00:00:51,654 --> 00:00:53,652
She takes the form of the moonbeam.

13
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:55,646
Well she is associated with the moon

14
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:59,940
and so that is how she is personified here and she baths him in light .

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,276
The beam is coming down from the moon light sky

16
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:07,677
but it got to get through all of that underbrush, and you notice that there is another figure.

17
00:01:07,677 --> 00:01:11,682
That is a Zephyr who is personification of the west wind.

18
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:15,058
Who helps Diana by pulling the branches back

19
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:19,301
so the light could bathe him in that extraordinary glow.

20
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:23,642
So we see this intres in the ideal male nude.

21
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:26,904
We kow that David's followers in this time were looking back

22
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:32,081
at ancient greek sculptures of nude athletes and gods.

23
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:34,978
And there is a real interes here in nudity.

24
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,153
But the form is soften to we don't really have a lot of anotomical

25
00:01:39,153 --> 00:01:44,804
details and terms of masculature and we will see a little bit at the abdomen.

26
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:49,904
But as we look at the arms and legs they look rather soft and in a way a litte bit feminine.

27
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:51,171
There is no question in fact the

28
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:56,110
entire painting glows so that all the clarity of lines has been removed.

29
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,056
And I think, it is quite clear

30
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:01,431
that Giordet has been looking at some of the earlier Italian masters I am thnking about

31
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:05,694
Leonardo's use of sfumato, and I am thinking about of some of the later manners, painters.

32
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:09,514
And I think we have in some ways the begginings of romanticism.

33
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:14,539
In the figure that is really languid and sensual.

34
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:17,605
And we have emotionalism here that is very different

35
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:22,192
from the severity and rationalism of Davide in neoclassicism.

36
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:25,948
I think that it is right in some ways at least in terms of temperament.

37
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:29,379
It is a return to the more lascivious

38
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,607
or actually you can't say lascivious because of course Diana was chased.

39
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:38,630
But to the emocionalism and the intres of a heart that has been so much apart of the rococo.
