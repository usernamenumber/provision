1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,680
So I have got this block of wood here that has a mass of 5 kilograms

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,830
and it is sitting on some dirt and we are near the surface of the earth

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:16,720
and the coefficient of static friction between this type of wood and this type of dirt is 0.60

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,030
and the coefficient of kinetic friction between this type of wood and this type of dirt is 0.55

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,630
This was measured by someone else long ago

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,060
or you found it in some type of a book someplace

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,300
And let's say we push on this side of the block with a force of a 100 N

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,440
What is going to happen?

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,250
So the first thing you might realize is if there is no friction

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,310
if this was a completely frictionless boundary and there is

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,640
no air resistance, we are assuming that there is no air resistance in this example

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,320
That in this dimension, in the horizontal dimension

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,220
there would only be one force here, this 100 N force

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,810
It would be completely unbalanced and that would be the net force

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,350
and so you would have a force going in that direction of a 100 N on a mass of 5 kilograms

16
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,540
Force = Mass times acceleration

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,580
acceleration and force are vector quantities

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,110
So you would have the force divided by the mass

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,640
would give you 20 meters per second of acceleration in the rightward direction

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,950
That is if there were no friction

21
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,040
but there is friction in this situation

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,160
So let's think about how we'll deal with it

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,950
So the coefficient of friction tells us

24
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,740
So this right here is the ratio between the magnitude of the force

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,460
that I have called the budging force

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,820
The amount of force you need to apply to get this thing to budge

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,670
to get this thing to start moving. So we can start using the coefficient of kinetic friction

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,200
It's the ratio between that and the magnitude of the force of contact

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,100
between this block and the floor or ground here

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,040
And the magnitude of that force of contact is the same thing

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,410
as the normal force that the ground is applying on the block

32
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,810
the magnitude of the normal force the ground is applying on the block

33
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,150
Then once its moving

34
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,650
then we can say that this is going to be--this will then be equal to

35
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,710
this over here will be equal to the force of friction

36
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,140
So this is the force that really overcome friction

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,360
and this over here will be equal to the force of friction

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,280
The magnitude of the force of friction over the force of contact

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,720
the contact force between those two, so over the normal force

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,140
and it makes sense

41
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,030
that the larger the contact force

42
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,050
the more that these are being pressed together

43
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,210
the little at the atomic level, they kind of really get into each others grooves

44
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,430
the more budging force you would need

45
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,620
or the more friction force would go against your motion

46
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,650
And in either situation

47
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,920
the force of friction is going against your motion

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,320
So even if you push it in that way

49
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,420
sounds like force of friction is all of a sudden going to help you

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,160
So let's think about what the necessary force will we need

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,500
to overcome the force of friction right here in the static situation

52
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,960
So the force of gravity on this block

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,760
is going to be the gravitational field which is 9.8 m/s^2 times 5 kilograms

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,550
9.8 m/s times 5 kilograms gives 49 kilogram meters per second or 49 newtons down

55
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,390
This is the force, the magnitude of the force due to gravity

56
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,540
the direction is straight down towards the center of the earth

57
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,140
The normal force, and that force is there because this block is not accelerating downwards

58
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,390
So there must be some force that completely balances off the force of gravity

59
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,030
And in this example, it is the normal force

60
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,100
So it is acting 49 newtons upward

61
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,060
and so these net out. And that's why this block does not accelerate upwards or downwards

62
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,970
So what we have is the budge the

63
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,050
magnitude of the budging force, needs to be equal to, over the magnitude of the normal force

64
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,620
well this thing right over here is going to be 49 newtons

65
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,810
Is equal to 0.60

66
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,370
Or we could say that the magnitude of the budging force

67
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,700
is equal to 49 newtons times the coefficient of static fiction

68
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:06,710
Or that's 49 newtons times 0.60

69
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,910
And remember coefficient of friction are unitless

70
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,040
So the units here are still going to be in newtons

71
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:22,580
So this 49 times .6 gives us 29.4 newtons

72
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:30,550
This is equal to 29.4 newtons

73
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,520
So that's the force that's started to overcome static friction

74
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,790
which we are applying more than enough of

75
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,920
so with a 100 newtons, we would just start to budge it

76
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,100
and right when we are in just in that moment

77
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,190
where that thing is just starting to move

78
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,580
the net force--

79
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,670
so we have a 100 newtons going in that direction

80
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,090
and the force of static friction is going to go in this direction--

81
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,580
maybe I could draw it down here to show it's coming from right over here

82
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,970
The force of static friction is going to be 29.4 newtons that way

83
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,650
and so right when I am just starting to budge this

84
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,030
just when that little movement--

85
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,930
because once I do that, then all of a sudden it's moving

86
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,180
and then kinetic friction starts to matter, but just for that moment

87
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,930
just for that moment I'll have a net force of 100 - 29.4

88
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:28,660
to the right, so I have a net force of 70.6 N

89
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,820
for just a moment while I budge it

90
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,250
So just exactly while I'm budging it

91
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,380
While we're overcoming the static friction, we have a 70.6 N net force in the right direction

92
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,980
And so just for that moment, you divide it by 5 kg mass

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,430
So just for that moment, it will be accelerating at 14.12 m/s^2

94
00:05:53,050 --> 00:06:00,280
So you'll have an acceleration of 14.1 m/s^2 to the right

95
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,250
but that will just be for that absolute moment, because once I budge it

96
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,420
all of a sudden the block will start to be moving

97
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,880
And once it's moving, the coefficient of kinetic friction starts to matter

98
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
We've got the things out of their little grooves

99
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,160
and so they're kind of gliding past each other on the top, although there still is resistant

100
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,550
So once we budge it, we'll have that acceleration for just a moment

101
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,550
Now all of a sudden, the coefficient of kinetic friction comes to play

102
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,080
And the force of friction, assuming we're moving

103
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,120
the magnitude of the force of friction will always go against our movement

104
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,460
is going to be--remember, our normal force is 49 N

105
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,850
So we can multiply both sides of this times 49

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:57,780
We get 49 N times 0.55 which is equal to 26.95 N

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,400
This is the force of friction; this is the magnitude

108
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,400
and it's going to go against our motions

109
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,690
So as soon as we start to move in that direction, the force of friction

110
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,480
is going to be going in that direction

111
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,050
So once we start moving, assuming that I'm continuing to apply this 100 newtons of force

112
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,280
what is the net force? So I have 100 N going that way

113
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,180
and I have 26.95 going that way

114
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,080
Remember, with vectors, I don't have to draw them here

115
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,890
I can draw all of their tails start at the center of mass of the

116
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,810
object. I can draw them whatever, but remember this is acting on the object

117
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,140
If we want to be precise, we can show it on the center of mass because

118
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,940
we can view all of these atoms as one collective object

119
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,150
But anyway, what is the net force now?

120
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,420
We have 100 N to the right; we have 26.95 to the left

121
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,750
100 minus 26.95

122
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,600
100 N that I'm applying to the right

123
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,260
- 26.95 N which is the force of friction to the left always acting against us

124
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,410
means that there's a net force to the right of 73.05

125
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:10,840
So once we're moving, we have a net force to the right of 73.05 N

126
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:18,070
This is the net force and it's acting to the right

127
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,850
Right after we budge it, how quickly will this accelerate?

128
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:32,700
Well, 73.05 divided by the mass, divided by 5 kg, gives us 14.61

129
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:40,430
So the acceleration once we're moving is going to be 14.61 m/s squared

130
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,450
to the right

131
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,190
So I really want to make sure you understand what's happening here

132
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,270
We always have enough force to start budging it

133
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,510
but right when we budged it

134
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,430
we overcome the static friction for just a moment

135
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,810
our acceleration was slower

136
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,900
because we're overcoming that static friction

137
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,900
but once we budged it and once it's moving

138
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,600
and assuming that we're continuing to apply a constant force over here

139
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,480
then all of a sudden, the force of friction since

140
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,400
we're kind of bump it along the top now and not stuck in their grooves

141
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,570
we're now using the coefficient of kinetic friction

142
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,780
And so once it's moving, the net force becomes greater in the rightward direction because

143
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,590
you can kind of view that force of friction will become less once it starts moving

144
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,820
And so now the force of friction went down a little bit to 26.95 N

145
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:38,630
And so now we're accelerating to right at a slightly faster rate 14.61 m/s^2

146
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,860
So right when you budge it, it accelerates at 14.1 m/s^2

147
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,870
but just for a moment, almost unnoticeable moment once it starts moving

148
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,780
Then you're going to be going to the right with this constant acceleration
