99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's talk about the acid/base definitions for Bronsted Lowry and also Lewis. So we will start with Bronsted Lowry.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So a Bronsted Lowry acid is a proton donor

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A Bronsted Lowry base is a proton acceptor

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets really quickly review what these definitions mean by protons

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we look at this diagram right here I am going to draw the hydrogen atom, the most common isotope

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So hydrogen has one proton in the nucleus and one electron somewhere around our nucleus, a negative charge like that

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so we would say that this is hydrogen, right? and then we put its one valence electron right there

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to represent the hydrogen atom, the most common isotope

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we were to

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
somehow take away this electron, we would only be left with the proton here, we would only be left with the proton in the nucleus

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so when we talk about a proton, we are talking about the

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
nucleus of a hydrogen atom which is equal to H+

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, no longer are we talking about the electron

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lets see how this applies to an acid base reaction

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so we start over here with water and then we have HCL over here on the right

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now in this bond between the H and the CL,right? One of those electrons came from the hydrogen and one that came from the chlorine, so let me just go ahead and

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
draw those in so the one from the hydrogen I am going to put in blue here

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's this hydrogen, that's this electron from hydrogen right here

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in blue

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then for chlorine, I am going to make that electron green

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so right in here like that

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so for this acid base

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
reaction

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a lone pair of electrons in the oxygen is going to take this proton, right

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So just the nucleus of the hydrogen atom

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
leaving the electron in blue behind

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that electron in blue stays behind

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and ends up on the chlorine

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets go ahead

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and draw what we would form from that

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we would have oxygen here the oxygen had two bonds to

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hydrogen and the oxygen just picked up another bond to hydrogen

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let me go ahead and mark

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
those electrons

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so these electrons over here in magenta formed

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a new bond with a proton

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so thats this bond here

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we had some electrons on oxygen

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me go ahead and make those in red

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So these electrons in red

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the oxygen didn't do anything so they're still there

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right here

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's going to give that oxygen a +1 formal charge

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is the hydronium ion

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
H3O+

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Our other product we would also make

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we would have our chlorine, which had three lone pairs of electrons around it already

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then it picked up both of those electrons so lets go ahead and

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
mark that one in green that it had originally brought to the dot structure

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and also the one in blue, the one it took from hydrogen like that,

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so chlorine now has a negative charge

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so its really the chloride anion

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is the Cl-

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like that

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lets identify our Bronsted Lowry

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
acid and our Bronsted Lowry base for this reaction

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lets go back over here and see what happens

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the H2O (the water) acted as a proton acceptor

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it accepted a proton from HCL

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so water would be
