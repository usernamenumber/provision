1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:08,589
In the last video I spoke a
bunch about the determining factor on whether we have
inflation or deflation.

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,352
It isn't so much the money
supply, although the money supply will have an effect,

3
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:17,819
it's really capacity utilization. Capacity utilization is
driven by demand.

4
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:20,550
And I made that distinction
because-- I gave that example of the island,

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,515
where you could
have a very small money supply, for example, one
seashell,

6
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:30,501
but if the velocity is really high, the people are
expressing that demand.

7
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:34,271
And you'll have very high
utilization of all of the capacity in the island

8
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:37,678
and you
might have inflation, even though the money supply
is one seashell.

9
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:39,990
On the other hand, let's say, we
found a bunch of seashells,

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,443
but everyone stops transacting,
so the velocity were to slow down a bunch.

11
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:47,960
So in that case, even though the
money supply is huge,

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,060
or a lot larger than it was, people
aren't expressing demand.

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,550
So demand will be a lot
lower than capacity.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,918
As we showed in the cupcakes
economics video, when you have a lot of unused capacity,

15
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:05,185
it's
everyone's incentive to try to sell that extra unit and
they all lower prices.

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,994
So you can have an increased
money supply but, if the velocity slows down or if
demand is slowing down--

17
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:16,870
because that's what's causing
the velocity to slow down--then you could still have a
deflationary situation.

18
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,350
Actually, we touched on the
chart where we showed that

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,030
every major inflationary bout
was actually stimulated,

20
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,720
or was actually preceded, by a
pretty big upturn in capacity utilization.

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,442
And the inflation really started
going once capacity utilization got into
the 80% range.

22
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:38,300
You could imagine that if, on
average, the world is running at 80%

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,979
that means that some
people are running at 70%, some people are running
at 90%, 95%.

24
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,998
And those people who are running
at 95%, those are the people who say, gee,

25
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:50,472
instead of
trying to run at 96%, 97%, 98% utilization,

26
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:54,185
why don't I
just raise price and not have to worry about producing
that extra unit?

27
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:58,289
And obviously their inputs go
into other people's; their outputs go into other
people's inputs.

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,580
And then you get a generalized
price inflation.

29
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,390
Now with that said, actually, I
want to make another point.

30
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,646
In the early `70s-- everyone
always talks about the oil shock.

31
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:11,390
In 1973 you had the
Yom Kippur War.

32
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,790
We resupplied Israel, and then
you had all the OPEC countries

33
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,314
that essentially stopped selling
oil to the U.S. and a lot of other western nations.

34
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,350
And people say, you know, oil
prices shot through the roof

35
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,860
and that's what drove inflation,
that supply shock.

36
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:30,219
That probably contributed
to it, but 1973 is right around there.

37
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:35,717
So if you actually look at this
chart, we're already kind of on an inflationary
spectrum.

38
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,800
The generalized prices were
already increasing.

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,640
And capacity utilization had
really preceded that.

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,700
That probably just added
fuel to the flame. With that said,

41
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,612
the question
that everyone's wondering about is, what's going
to happen now?

42
00:02:48,620 --> 00:03:00,588
So before the current financial
crisis, we had a certain amount of capacity.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:08,260
Let's say this is everything,
this is the U.S. output.

44
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,922
Let's say this is
U.S. GDP, right? GDP is just output.

45
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,222
So in a normal developed
environment, so that you go back into the `60s--

46
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:21,025
and I
should probably get the Bloomberg chart on this too,
because it's pretty interesting--

47
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:36,565
About 60% of our
GDP was on consumption. And consumption always
isn't a bad thing.

48
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,420
Consumption isn't always
a bad thing.

49
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,707
It's actually what
we use to have a good standard of living.

50
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,098
If I have a nice sofa, and a TV
set, and I go on vacations, that's consumption.

51
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:47,050
But it improves our standard of
living

52
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,425
and the goal of all countries is really
to improve that average standard of living.

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,840
But the remainder is savings.

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:02,071
In a traditionally responsible,
developed nation you save 40%, maybe 30% to
40%,

55
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:04,646
depending on whether you're Japan or whether
you're Western Europe.

56
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:09,702
Now what savings turns into, is
essentially new investment to raise your ouput.

57
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:21,321
So this savings is what allows
you to increase your output in the next year.

58
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:28,065
If you don't save even a little
bit, your output will actually decrease, because no
one will invest in factories

59
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:33,150
and the factories will get old
and the roads will stop being usable and all the rest.

60
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,418
Whenever someone's investing, that's someone else's savings.

61
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:41,232
And it's very important to
realize that investment and savings are really two sides
of the same coin.

62
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:45,620
If no one's saving, then
there's no money for investment. But just going back to this
example,

63
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,142
when people are saving that's what not only
maintains output, but actually increases total output.

64
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:54,120
So this would be in the next
year or the next decade.

65
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,185
And then, when we consume 60%
of this, we're consuming 60% of a larger number

66
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:05,199
and our
standard of living will go up. And this is a very sustainable
and good situation.

67
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:12,705
What happened, unfortunately,
really since the early `80s, is that we had a constant
expansion of credit.

68
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:15,690
We started lending more and
more money to everyone

69
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,165
and other countries started
lending more and more money to us.

70
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:21,990
And most of that got expressed
in more and more consumption.

71
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:32,940
So if you look at U.S.
output-- This is GDP.

72
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,135
If you actually go to 2007, the
average American consumed more than we produced.

73
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:47,599
We had a negative savings. If I were to draw that,
it looks like this.

74
00:05:47,599 --> 00:06:00,605
In 2007, consumption was larger
than our total output. So the question is, how
did this happen?

75
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,030
Everyone talks about money
and currencies. Essentially we borrowed output
from other people.

76
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,270
When we borrow money from the
Chinese, which we use to buy their goods,

77
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,214
we're essentially
just borrowing their output, right? We're borrowing their goods.

78
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:18,590
So when we give them a dollar
bill, that's a promise that,

79
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,022
in the future, they could use
that dollar bill to come back and use some of our output.

80
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,884
But over the course of the last
several decades, we were just borrowing other
people's output.

81
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:30,939
And we became net debtors. So when your consumption is
actually larger than your output,

82
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,445
you immediately start
to realize that this isn't a sustainable situation
for too long.

83
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:38,608
And maybe we borrowed a little
bit more money and, actually it did turn out that way,

84
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:43,308
that
we borrowed some people's output even more to fuel some
of our investment as well.

85
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,737
It's not like no investment
was going on for the last 20, 30 years. We had a lot of investment.

86
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:55,234
But essentially, the consumption
and investment was being financed by other
people's output.

87
00:06:55,234 --> 00:07:01,828
And, of course, when you have
consumption touching up against-- you're fully utilized,

88
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:05,985
that makes it even more an incentive to invest.
So all of these people were willing to invest in the U.S.

89
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:13,374
What happened now is, you
realize that a lot of the financing or a lot of the debt
that was being taken on,

90
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:17,810
it was being facilitated by
people's homes and home equity loans but people really
aren't good for it.

91
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,584
And now all of a sudden, the
banks dried up, liquidity is gone,

92
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:23,941
people can't borrow
money, and you have a demand shock.

93
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:28,507
So what you have is a situation
where a considerable amount of this consumption,

94
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:35,645
and
actually a considerable amount of that investment that
was being fueled by financing, disappears.

95
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:38,805
And now that we're in a global
world, we really should think about global output.

96
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:44,192
But it doesn't matter,
we could talk about just U.S. output. But now that this demand has
disappeared--

97
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:50,725
if this is U.S. output and let's say, this is
output that we were taking from China or Japan or wherever
else--

98
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:55,933
and our consumption has now
fallen down here. And it's not because, all of a
sudden,

99
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,360
people became prudent. It's because people aren't
willing to lend them,

100
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,870
to go to Williams-Sonoma and buy a $50
spatula or whatever else.

101
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,477
They just can't get another
credit card loan or a home equity loan.

102
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,740
So you have the situation
now, where you have low utilization.

103
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,965
And this comes back
to what we talked about in the last video.

104
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,157
That when you have low
utilization, it's everyone's incentive to lower prices.

105
00:08:16,157 --> 00:08:18,915
When you have a bunch
of vacant houses, people lower rents.

106
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,535
When the car factories are
empty, people lower the price of car factories.

107
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:26,620
When people are underutilized,
wages go down.

108
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,610
You see this shock, more
recently, right here.

109
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,957
As we said in the last video,
the orange line is U.S. capacity utilization.

110
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,610
And it dropped from about
the 80% range.

111
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,685
If it had gone up here, I would
have started getting worried about hyperinflation.

112
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:50,885
But, you see, right around
summer of 2007 it dropped off of a cliff and it's down
here someplace.

113
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:53,230
Now you see a little bit later,
inflation dropped.

114
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,629
So that dynamic that we've been
talking about, capacity utilization falling off,

115
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:59,326
because
we essentially had a demand shock.

116
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:02,550
And then that's led to
a decrease in prices.

117
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,941
So the question is, everything
that the Treasury is doing, and the Fed is printing money,

118
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:12,270
and Obama spending a trillion-dollar stimulus,
is that going to lead to inflation?

119
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,110
My answer is, just watch the
capacity utilization numbers.

120
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:22,738
And, just you know, the stimulus
plan, the whole idea about it is,

121
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:25,765
the government
doesn't want us to enter into a deflationary spiral.

122
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:30,250
If consumption drops like this,
we have all of this capacity and prices go down.

123
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,771
If prices go down a little
bit, it doesn't affect people's behavior
in aggregate.

124
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:37,233
But if people start having
expectations that wages will go down,

125
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:43,592
that prices will go
down then, they all go into panic mode and they
stop spending.

126
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:51,731
Let's say they stop spending,
then utilization goes down even more,

127
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:56,584
then unemployment
goes up even more, and this also makes fear go
up even more.

128
00:09:56,584 --> 00:10:01,090
Unemployment going up and fear
going up makes people stop spending even more.

129
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:07,612
And this is that deflationary
cycle that all the economists and all of the government
officials are afraid of.

130
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:11,250
You saw that during the
Great Depression.

131
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:24,226
Let me draw a zero point
to show you where. That is zero.

132
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,002
That's the dividing
line between inflation and deflation.

133
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,500
You see we've had a couple
of bouts of deflation.

134
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,740
And they normally aren't good
times in the world.

135
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,260
This is the Great Depression
right here.

136
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:41,412
This is post World War I, and
the Great Depression actually lasted all the way until--

137
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:47,917
we
entered the war in the late `30s-- right about
here to here. We had a little bit
of inflation.

138
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:50,400
You had the first wave of the
New Deal stimulating some spending,

139
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,428
but it really never
got us to any significant level of inflation.

140
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:58,825
Just so you have a sense, I
would consider anything above 5% inflation as really,
really bad.

141
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:03,328
And let me draw a line there. So that's the 5%
inflation mark.

142
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:09,032
So we really didn't get above 5%
inflation until you end up with World War I,

143
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:14,125
and then you
have the postwar period, we're under Bretton Woods, and then
in the `70s we had,

144
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:19,271
as I talked about before, the oil
shock and all of the rest. The rest is history.

145
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:26,999
But as you see, the deflationary
periods are things that government officials
want to avoid altogether.

146
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:32,673
So the idea of the stimulus is
for the government to borrow money, because no-one
else can.

147
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:38,734
And they can essentially fill
up the gap where the consumers left off.

148
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:41,497
Now the question is, are
they going to fill up enough of a gap?

149
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:44,290
Actually I realize that I'm
running out of time again.

150
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,397
I don't like to make these
videos too long, so I'll talk about that in the next video.
