1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,275
We have a hairy looking expression here

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:05,800
and your goal is to try to simplify it

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,890
as much as you can. I'll give you a little

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,025
bit of time to do it

5
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:14,406
Let's just think about it step by step

6
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:16,006
It might help if you were actually to

7
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:17,402
reorder the terms

8
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:18,936
in this expression

9
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,201
So let me put all the "x" terms first

10
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:23,272
so I have"5x" that's that term

11
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:26,069
minus 2x

12
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:31,750
plus 7y

13
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:35,274
plus 3y

14
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:39,673
then I have "+ 8z"

15
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:43,409
And then I have minus Z

16
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,007
and the last term that I haven't included yet

17
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:49,867
is "+5". Right over here

18
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,670
Now let's just think it through.

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,606
If I have 5 x and I were to take away 2 x

20
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:58,669
how many x would I be left with?

21
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:00,943
Well I would be left with 3 x. That's true

22
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:02,329
of anything. There's not same fancy

23
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,003
algebraic magic going on.

24
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:06,465
5 of anything minus two of that same thing

25
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:08,323
You're going to be left of 3 of that same thing

26
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:11,413
In this case that "thing" is x

27
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:17,326
So this is going to simplify to 3x

28
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:19,337
Now in a lot of algebra classes you will hear

29
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:21,961
people say, "Oh, well the coefficient on 5x

30
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:29,942
is 5 and the coefficient here is negative two

31
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:32,987
and we have to add the coefficient

32
00:01:32,987 --> 00:01:37,738
(let me write that word down)

33
00:01:37,738 --> 00:01:39,161
these right over here are the coefficient

34
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:40,872
they're the number that your mutiplying

35
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:43,003
the variable by

36
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,803
So the 5 or the negative 2 in this case

37
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:47,244
you could just so

38
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:49,071
Oh I can just add the coefficient

39
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:51,005
and that's ok. There's nothing wrong with that

40
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:52,668
but I really want to emphasize

41
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:54,709
there's a very common sense intuition here

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,872
You have 5 of something

43
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:57,909
you take away two of that something

44
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,669
you are left with three of that something

45
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:03,826
you have to make sure that your adding

46
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,823
and subtracting the same thing

47
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:08,086
here we're dealing with x's

48
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,743
so we can take 5x and take away 2x

49
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:13,866
we can't think about merging the x and the y

50
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,200
at least, not in any simple way right now

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,609
because frankly that would make any intuitive sense

52
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:20,908
now let's think about the y

53
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:22,204
if I have 7 of something

54
00:02:22,204 --> 00:02:24,243
and I were to add 3 more of that something

55
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:25,913
then I would have 10 of that something

56
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,004
so this part right over here

57
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:30,167
is going to simplify to

58
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,819
10 y

59
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,162
once again you could say the coefficient

60
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:35,210
on 7y is 7

61
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,078
the coefficient on 3y is 3

62
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:39,340
we added the coefficients (7+

63
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,201
3) to get to 10y

64
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:43,497
but I really want to emphasize the intuition here

65
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,671
If you have 7 of something you add another

66
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:48,413
3 of something, you have 10 of something

67
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:50,336
now let's look at the Z

68
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,336
if I've got 8 of something

69
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:53,831
and I take away one of them

70
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:55,489
I'm going to have 7 of that something

71
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:56,939
that is 7z and you might say hey

72
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:59,603
what was the coefficient here on the -Z

73
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:01,267
I don't see any number out front

74
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:03,403
of the z. Well implicitly I could have put

75
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:04,755
a one here.

76
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,276
It's exactly the same thing.

77
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:07,603
Subtract a Z is the same thing as

78
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:09,339
subtracting 1z

79
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:11,410
the word 1z strikes a part of my brain

80
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,155
because I have very young children

81
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:14,911
but that's a different type of 1z

82
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:16,470
and then you can see yeah you definetly

83
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,609
did add the two coefficients

84
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,496
The 8 and the -1

85
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:22,603
but once again common sense tells you

86
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,163
that if you have eight of something

87
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,269
and you take away one of them

88
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,273
you have 7 of that something

89
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:32,006
and then finally you have a plus 5

90
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:33,007
so we're done

91
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:39,496
this simplified to 3x plus 10 y plus 7z

92
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:43,000
plus 5
