1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,580
We're on problem 87.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,780
Machine A produces parts twice as fast as machine B does.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,930
So machine A produces 100 parts twice as fast as machine B,

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,000
let me just keep reading,machine B produces 100 parts

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,990
in 40 minutes.

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,500
So that's equal to what?

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,060
100 divided by 40,that's 2.5 parts per minute.

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,690
And they told us A produces it twice as fast,

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,160
so A is going to be twice that,

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,190
so A is going to be 5 parts per minute.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,310
If each machine produces parts at a constant rate,

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,570
how many parts does machine A produce in 6 minutes?

13
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,690
So 5 parts per minute times 6 minutes.

14
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,720
6 minutes is equal to what?

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,870
Minutes cancel out,6 times 5 is 30 parts. Choice A. 88.

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,710
A necklace is made by stringing n individual beads together

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,850
in the repeating pattern red bead,green bead, white bead.

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:24,570
Let's see. So,red,green,white,blue,and then yellow,

19
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,580
and you keep repeating.

20
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,740
If the necklace begins with a red bead,

21
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,720
and ends with a white bead,then n could be equal to?

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,980
So let's think about it,it starts with a red bead,

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,240
and ends with a white bead.

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,850
So let's think about this,if it's exactly a multiple of 5,

25
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:53,270
if n is equal to exactly the number of beads in this pattern,

26
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,240
then it'll always end with a yellow.

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,950
So if n is equal to some multiple of 5,it could be 5,

28
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,300
it could be 10,or whatever,

29
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,500
then you're going to end with a yellow bead.

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,020
That makes sense.

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,600
If you have 10,you'd just have the pattern twice.

32
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,850
If n is equal to some multiple of 5 plus 1,

33
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,320
then you're always going to complete the cycle completely,

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,140
and then your going to have one more,

35
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,500
and you're going to end with a red bead.

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,250
I think you see the pattern here.

37
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,700
If n is equal to some multiple of 5,

38
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,330
and then it has 2 left over,

39
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,400
or when it's divided by 5,it has a remainder of 2,

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,170
you're going to end with a green bead.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,460
The multiple of 5 parts,

42
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,560
you're going to complete all the way to yellow,

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,880
and you're going to have 1,2 left.

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,010
And so if n is equal to a multiple of 5 plus 3,

45
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,780
then you're going to end with a white bead.

46
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,380
So a multiple of 5 plus 3 is essentially any number

47
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,710
that ends with either an 8 or 3,because a multiple of 5

48
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,320
ends with either a 5 or a 0.

49
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,960
So let's see what choices they give us.

50
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,870
They give us 16,not a multiple of 5 plus 3.

51
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,530
32,not a multiple of 5 plus 3,41 is not,54 is not.

52
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,180
68,that is a multiple of 5 plus 3. It's 65 plus 3.

53
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,770
65 is 13 times 5,that's equal to 13 times 5 plus 3,

54
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,680
so the choice is E. Problem 89.

55
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:44,490
In the x-y coordinate system,if a,b and a plus 3,b plus k

56
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,190
are two points on the line defined by the equation x is

57
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:57,070
equal to 3y minus 7,then k is equal to what?

58
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,120
Well I think an easier thing to do is to--

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,880
well actually we could just stay--

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,730
let's just define y in terms of x.

61
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,780
So you get x plus 7 is equal to 3y,

62
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,270
y is equal to 1/3 x plus 7 over 3.

63
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,550
OK,let's see what we can do.

64
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,490
So the slope of this line is 1/3,if you remember from algebra

65
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,030
this mx plus b form,but this is how fast the line

66
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,450
goes up or down, this 1/3. Every move to the right in x by 1,

67
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,640
you're moving up in y by 1/3. So what's the slope?

68
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,280
If you give me two points,what's the slope?

69
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,370
What's the change in y over the change in x?

70
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,770
So I'll call this y1 and this is y2.

71
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,030
Or point 1 and point 2,so you could say change in y is

72
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,610
b plus k,the latter y point minus the first y point,

73
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:03,380
over a plus 3 minus a. And what does this reduce to?

74
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,480
b plus k minus k,b's cancel out,a plus 3 minus a,

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,400
a's cancel out,I'm left with k over 3,

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,890
and that equals the slope.

77
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,850
We already know the slope is equal to 1/3.

78
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,810
k over 3 is equal to 1/3,so k is equal to 1.

79
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:33,510
It's choice D. Problem 90.At the rate of m meters per second,

80
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,750
how many meters does a cyclist travel in x minutes?

81
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,010
So remember,this is tricky. They said x meters per second,

82
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,490
how many meters does a cyclist travel in x minutes,

83
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,110
so let's get x in terms of seconds.

84
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,870
So x minutes is going to be 60x seconds,

85
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,910
because you have 60 seconds per minute. So 60x seconds.

86
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,890
And distance is equal to rate times time,

87
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,280
hopefully that's a little bit of intuition for you now,

88
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,720
but the rate is equal to m meters per second,

89
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,600
and he's traveling for 60x seconds,so you get m times 60x,

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,590
which is 60mx in seconds,times meters per second,that's meters

91
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,380
So 60mx meters.

92
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,190
How many meters does a cyclist travel in x minutes?

93
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,810
x minutes is 60x seconds.

94
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,630
How many meters does a cyclist travel--

95
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:53,240
right,rate times time,at a rate of m meters per second.

96
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:01,070
I think they made a boo-boo here,because they have to

97
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:11,320
have the 60m-- oh,I see the mistake I made.

98
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,430
Let me redo it,my bad.

99
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:24,260
They said,at the rate of m meters per s seconds,

100
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:31,110
so the cyclist's rate is actually m over s meters per second.

101
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,030
That's confusing because they said that s seconds,

102
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,310
and I thought they said,m meters per second,

103
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,880
but it's a rate of m meters per s seconds,

104
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,360
how many meters does a cyclist travel in x minutes,

105
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,180
which we know is 60, if it's x minutes, it's 60x seconds.

106
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:56,120
So you multiply the rate times the time,and you get 60mx

107
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,050
over s,which is choice E. And it saved me that

108
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,650
my original answer wasn't anywhere in any of the choices.

109
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:14,060
Problem 91. If Sam were twice as old as he is,

110
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,050
he would be 40 years older than Jim.

111
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,340
So 2 times Sam,so if Sam were twice as old as he,

112
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,980
so s is Sam's current age. If Sam were twice as old as he is,

113
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,100
he would be 40 years older than Jim,

114
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,740
so he would be Jim plus 40.

115
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,360
If Jim is 10 years younger than Sam,how old is Sam?

116
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,180
Jim is 10 years younger than Sam,

117
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,450
so we can say Sam is Jim plus 10.

118
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,140
We could've also said Sam minus 10 is equal to Jim,

119
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,370
same thing. Let's see what we can do here,

120
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,660
let's see how best we can solve this equation.

121
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,390
They want to know how old is Sam.

122
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,850
We want to solve for s,so let's do something.

123
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,220
Let's subtract this equation from that equation.

124
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:08,290
So 2s minus s is s,j minus j is 0,40 minus 10 is 30.

125
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,960
So Sam is 30,and we're done.

126
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,360
And there's a lot of ways you could've done that.

127
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,670
You could have solved for j,and substituted here then solved,

128
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,870
it would've taken a little bit more time,

129
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,800
but we just subtracted this equation from that,

130
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,880
and you got s is equal to 30,which is choice B.

131
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,400
And I think I'm about out of time,

132
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,520
so I'll continue into the next video. See you soon.
