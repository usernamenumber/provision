1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:09,420
This right here is a picture of Henrietta Swan Leavitt.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,078
And she made,

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:14,095
a little over a hundred years ago -- this is in the early 1900's --

4
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:18,692
while working for Edward Charles Pickering, who was a Harvard astronomer,

5
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:20,944
while working for his observatory,

6
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:23,667
she made what is arguably -- well, defintely

7
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:27,353
one of the most important discoveries in all of astronomy.

8
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:31,200
And probably, well, I would say it ranks in the top three,

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,017
because it really enabled people like Hubble to start

10
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:36,200
realizing that the universe is expanding.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,123
Or even be able to think about how to

12
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:42,098
measure distances to objects in space well beyond

13
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:44,025
the reach of our tools of paralax.

14
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:45,697
We saw with paralax you have to have

15
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:47,133
extremely sensitive instruments

16
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,366
just to even measure distances to stars

17
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:51,133
relatively close to us,

18
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:53,133
very sensitive instruments to get to stars

19
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,867
maybe further out into our galaxy.

20
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:58,282
And we don't have the intstruments even today

21
00:00:58,282 --> 00:00:59,733
to measure things beyond our galaxy.

22
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:02,000
But because of Henrietta Swan Leavitt,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,533
we're able to approximate or get good senses

24
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,000
of the objects beyond our galaxy.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,533
So let's just think about what she did.

26
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:16,800
So her job was literally to classify stars in the Large Magellanic

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,000
(I have trouble saying that, "Magellanic Cloud.")

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,358
and the Small Magellanic Clouds.

29
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:27,200
And this is what they look like from the Southern Hemisphere.

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
This is the large, right over here.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,949
And this is the small, right over here.

32
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:36,688
And remember, this is before Hubble realized,

33
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:39,683
or showed the world,

34
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,667
that there are stars beyond our galaxy,

35
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,352
that there are galaxies beyond our galaxy.

36
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:46,022
So at this point in time people didn't even fully appreciate

37
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,800
that these were separate galaxies.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
We just said, "Hey these are kind of these blobs,

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,477
or these clusters of stars that we see

40
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,200
in the Southern Hemisphere."

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,133
And just to get a sense of where they are relative to

42
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,200
our galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy,

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
this is obviously not an actual picture --

44
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,950
we can't take a picture from this vantage point.

45
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,273
This would have to be very, very far away,

46
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:06,688
but this is the milky way right here,

47
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:09,358
and this is the small magellanic cloud,

48
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:12,067
and this is the large magellanic cloud

49
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,026
(I'm getting better at saying it.)

50
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:19,733
So her job was just to classify the different stars

51
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:21,133
that she saw.

52
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,133
But while she was classifying,

53
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,940
she looked at these things called variables.

54
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,200
And it turns out what she was looking at were a

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:34,761
class of stars called Cepheid variable stars.

56
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:37,106
And what's interesting about them is two things:

57
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,521
They're super-dooper bright;

58
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:42,667
they're up to 30,000 times as luminous as the sun,

59
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:45,800
and they're five to twenty times more massive than the sun,

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,108
5 - 20 X the sun's mass.

61
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:53,200
But what makes them interesting is, one,

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,933
they're really bright so you can see them from really far way.

63
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,354
You can see these Cepheid variable

64
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:59,133
stars is other galaxies,

65
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:03,113
in fact we can see them well beyond even the Small Magellanic Cloud

66
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:04,533
or the Large Magellanic Cloud.

67
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:06,800
You can see these stars in other galaxies.

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,867
And what's even more interesting about them is that

69
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,031
their intensity is variable,

70
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:12,772
that they become brighter and dimmer

71
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:15,349
with a well-defined period.

72
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:17,267
So if you're looking at a Cepheid variable star

73
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,800
(and this is just kind of a simulation,

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,933
a very cheap simulation)

75
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,800
it might look like this [large circle],

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,356
and then over the course of the next three or four days,

77
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:29,000
it might reduce in intensity to something like this [small circle].

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,535
And then after three, four days again,

79
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:32,867
it will look like this [large].

80
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:34,761
And then it'll look like this again [small].

81
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,733
So it's actual intensity is going up and down

82
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:38,933
with a well-defined period.

83
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:40,400
So if this takes three days,

84
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,467
and this is another three days,

85
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:43,771
then the period --

86
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:45,350
one entire cycle

87
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,533
of its going from low-intensity back to high intensity --

88
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,133
is going to be six days.

89
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:55,533
So this is a six-day period.

90
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:59,200
And what Henrietta Leavitt saw --

91
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,600
this wasn't an obvious thing to do.

92
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,867
She plotted . . .

93
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,867
She assumed that everything in each of these clouds

94
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:06,533
were roughly the same distance away;

95
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,533
everything in the Large Magellenic Cloud is

96
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,032
roughly the same distance away.

97
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:11,774
And it's obviously not exact.

98
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:13,800
This is an entire galaxy so you have obviously things

99
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,768
futher away in the galaxy,

100
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:16,933
and things closer up.

101
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:17,867
You have stars here,

102
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:18,800
and here.

103
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,690
And their distance isn't going to be exactly the same to us.

104
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,200
We're sitting maybe over here someplace.

105
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,615
But it's going to be close.

106
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,200
It wasn't a bad approximation.

107
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,804
And by making that assumption, she saw something pretty neat.

108
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:31,206
If she plotted . . .

109
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:34,110
Let me plot this right over here.

110
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,899
So she plotted on the horizontal axis

111
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:47,010
the relative luminosity.

112
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,200
So, really,

113
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,364
the only way she could measure this is how bright did they look to her,

114
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:53,000
and she's assuming that they're the same distance.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,613
So, obviously if you have a brighter star but it's much

116
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,267
much further away,

117
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:58,575
it's going to look dimmer.

118
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:00,338
So if you assume that they're all the distance

119
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:01,591
roughly the same distance

120
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:03,652
then how bright it is will tell you how bright it is

121
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,400
at the actual star.

122
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,133
So she plotted relative luminosity of the star

123
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,118
on one axis.

124
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:11,841
And on the other axis

125
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:19,518
she plotted the period of these variable stars.

126
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:20,133
And what I'm going to do is,

127
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,954
I'm going to do this on a logarithmic scale.

128
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,873
So let's say that this is in days.

129
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:26,449
So this is one day, this is ten days,

130
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:30,713
this is one-hundred days, right over here.

131
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:33,256
So a logarithmic scale 'cause I'm going up in powers of ten.

132
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:34,821
I could say that . . .

133
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,768
If we take the log of these,

134
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,462
this would be zero,

135
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:40,521
this would be 1, this would be two.

136
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:42,200
And so that's what I'm using as a scale.

137
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,282
So I'm using the log of the period.

138
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:46,533
Or I'm just marking them as 1, 10, 100

139
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,021
but I'm giving each of these factors of ten

140
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:49,133
an equal spacing.

141
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,800
When you plot it on this scale:

142
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,133
the relative luminosity vs. the period --

143
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,200
she got a plot that looks something like this.

144
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,267
And this is obviously not exact.

145
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:02,267
She got a plot that looks something like this.

146
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,112
It was a fairly linear relationship,

147
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,533
when you plot the relative luminosity against

148
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,200
the log of the period.

149
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,867
So this is obviously a logarithmic scale over here,

150
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:14,770
and so you could fit a line.

151
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,347
And why, I'd argue --

152
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:18,867
and I think most people would argue --

153
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:22,781
this is one of the most important discoveries in astronomy is

154
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:24,200
if you know . . .

155
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,800
'cause think about what the problem here is:

156
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,193
We can look at all these stars in space.

157
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:30,211
Let's say you look at a fraction of the sky,

158
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,267
and you look at something that looks like that,

159
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,267
so it's really bright.

160
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:35,273
And then you see something dim

161
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:36,467
that looks like that.

162
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,733
So if you had a very superficial understanding,

163
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,684
you'd say, "oh, this star is brighter."

164
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:44,352
You would say that this is a fundamentally brighter star.

165
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:45,281
But how do you know that?

166
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,600
Maybe instead of being brighter,

167
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,133
maybe it's just a dimmer, closer star.

168
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,200
Maybe this is a closer star.

169
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,617
Maybe this is an entire galaxy,

170
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:55,933
but it's so far away you can't even tell.

171
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,448
But all of a sudden,

172
00:06:57,448 --> 00:07:02,441
by the work that Henrietta Leavitt did,

173
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:06,933
if you see one of these Cepheid variable stars in another galaxy,

174
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:10,010
you know it's relative brightness

175
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,067
compared to other Cepheid variable stars.

176
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,400
So if you can place just one of these Cepheid variable stars,

177
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,533
if you know exactly the distance to one of them,

178
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,267
and then you know its absolute luminosity,

179
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:21,800
you then know the absolute luminosity

180
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,133
of any other Cepheid variable stars.

181
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,682
So let's say using parallax,

182
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:29,800
which is our other tool,

183
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,733
we find . . .

184
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,933
Let's say there is some star in our galaxy

185
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,667
and let's say using parallax

186
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:39,430
we're able to come up with a pretty good measure

187
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,473
that it is -- I don't know --

188
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:45,625
let's say it's 100 lightyears away.

189
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:50,877
And this star is a Cepheid variable star.

190
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:55,000
And let's say it's period is one day.

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,267
So we know, we now know something interesting.

192
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:02,696
We know variable stars, with a period of one day,

193
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:04,200
at 100 lightyears away,

194
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,221
will look like this.

195
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:09,329
Will look like this drawing right over here.

196
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:14,933
So if we later on see a Cepheid variable star

197
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:21,200
with a period of one day --

198
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
so it get's brighter and dim over the course of one day

199
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,358
(and maybe it's red-shifted as well)

200
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:28,467
but maybe it looks a little bit dimmer;

201
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,351
it looks like this --

202
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:34,800
we now know that if it was 100 lightyears away,

203
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,016
it would have this luminosity.

204
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,933
So based on how much dimmer it is,

205
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,777
we can then figure out how much further away

206
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:43,200
this cepheid variable star is.

207
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,267
If that confuses you a little bit,

208
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:46,350
I'll do a little bit more details in the next few videos,

209
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,533
and we can get a closer sense of how the math worked.

210
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:50,800
But this was a big discovery.

211
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,333
Discovering this class of stars, this Cepheid variable class --

212
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,333
She wasn't the one who discovered them;

213
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,267
people knew before her that there were

214
00:08:58,267 --> 00:08:59,667
these stars that got brighter and dimmer. --

215
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,933
But what her big discovery was is seeing this

216
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:05,867
linear relationship between the relative luminosity of these stars

217
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,333
and their period.

218
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,616
Because then, if we see Cepheid variable stars in

219
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,533
completely different galaxies

220
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,355
or galactic clusters,

221
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:14,600
by looking at their period,

222
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,533
we know what their real relative luminosity is.

223
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,951
And then we can guess how far those things really are.

224
00:09:18,951 --> 99:59:59,999
No, we can ESTIMATE how far those things really are.
