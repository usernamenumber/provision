1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's imagine that I'm here,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is me, at the age--

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
actually I'll do this right now,

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
--let's say at the age of 31.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then, then I go into the future.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is a line from the present.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then I go into the future,

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is me again,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is now at the age of 71.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I've-- I've got fourty extra years

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I even picked up a --a cane,

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to help me walk around.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And finally I go even further in the future

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and -and being very optimistic.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm gonna go ahead and say

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is at the age of 101

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I live to be a centenial

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and sitting in a wheelchair at the age of 101

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm gonna wave out at you.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, that's me in a wheelchair

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're gonna apply that formula

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we've been talk about so much

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
delta P equals Q times R

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so as I said Q is cardiac output

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we got R is Resistance

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we got this formula

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and let's say I go to the doctor's office

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I go today, and I go when 40 years,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I go again when I'm a 101

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And today they tell me

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
my boold pressure is 120/80

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and actually I went not too long ago

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's pretty much what they told me it was.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I go in the future,

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in 40 years they tell me it's actually gone up

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
my blood pressure's now 150/90

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
an in fact I go again mhen I'm 101

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they say it's 180/ --let's say /105.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, the blood pressure is raising

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's bawically what I'm told.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they say, well-- you know,

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you gotta make sure you eat well,

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and excersice, and--

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that should help your blood pressure.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'm left to wondering

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what the connection is between the two.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let's figure out what the connection is exactly

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, my blood pressure I just said it's 120/80

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if I wanna figure out my mean arterial pressure

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so my [mean arterial pressure]

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
meaning the average pressure in my arteries

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I've actually used my blood pressure

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to keep me a guess as to what it's gonna be.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I know that I spend about 1/3 --

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
my mean arterial pressure is gonna equal

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1/3 times my systolic

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
'cause I know I spend about 1/3 of the time--

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
my heart does, anyway--

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it spends about 1/3 of this time beating

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it spends 2/3 of the time relaxing

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the relaxing pressure is the diastolic pressure,

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's 80.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so that works at about 95

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so that's how I came up with that 95 number

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's also why it's not exactly 100
