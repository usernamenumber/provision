99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're in San Lorenzo in Florence in the Old Sacristy

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a room that is traditionally used when a church

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for the priest of fast. That is, to put on the garments

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for a religious ritual, But in this case, it was

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
intended to be a mausoleum for the founder of the

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Medici dynasty. Giovanni di Bicci de Medici who is baried here along

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with his wife, in the early 1400s when a group of people decided to

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
rebuild the church that was here and the families contributed money.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, it wasn't that they were chipping in. Each was in control of its own

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
chapel. Giovanni di Bicci de Medici decided to

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pay for the building of the Sacristy. He got a bigger space. He got a

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
bigger space, he paid more money and he hired Brunelleschi. He was smart. We should

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
say that when you enter the church, the Sacristy is off

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the left transept. It is now known as the Old Sacristy.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because Michaelangelo designed the New Sacristy. But here we are in Brunelleschi's

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Old Sacristy which is the epitome of Renaissance architecture

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, Brunelleschi has done some extraordinary things here. First of all, there is a sense

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of solemnity, of calmness, that is in part a

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
result of the extraordinary sense of geometry here, and order

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
rationalism, so many of the characteristics that we associate with 15th century

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Florentine Renaissaince thinking humanism. So instead of

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the mysterious basis of a Gothic church we have

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a space built on the fundamental geometric shapes

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the square and the circle and a sense of

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
clarity. This notion of geometry having a kind of

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
philosophical importance. And of course, this is a burial

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
site. And so the idea of the eternal, the idea in fact of resurrection

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is crucial here. The room itself is a perfect square.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact, one could argue it comes close to being a cube but then it's

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
surmounted by this beautiful hemispheric dome and one of the ways

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which historians understand this is that the circles reference

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the spirituality of the geometry of heaven. If you think about a circle, it has no

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
beginning and no end. like God. Whereas we inhabit the

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
much more rectilinear space, the earthly space, the space of gravity.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So how do you get the circle down to the square

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is the room itself? He has done this by borrowing a technique

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we find in Byzantine architecture, thinking about Aya Sofia, which is
