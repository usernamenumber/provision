1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,110
Near the end of the last video,
I wasn't as articulate

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,710
as I would like to be.

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,430
Mainly because I think 15
minutes into a video my brain

5
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,590
starts to really warm
up too much.

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,060
But what I want to do
is restate what I

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,820
was trying to say.

8
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,750
We got this confidence
interval.

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,000
I'll rewrite it here.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,150
   

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,020
I'll just restate the
confidence interval.

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,620
So there's the 95% confidence
interval for the mean of this

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,870
distribution.

14
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:39,045
   

15
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:46,620
So, the mean of that
distribution, we got as being

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,990
1.91 plus or minus 1.21.

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,460
And near the end of the
video I tried to

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,780
explain why that is neat.

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,450
Because here we have this
confidence interval for this

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,870
weird mean of the difference
between the sampling means.

21
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,260
So it seems kind of confusing.

22
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,450
But I just want to
restate what we

23
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,220
saw in previous videos.

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,370
This thing right over here, the
mean of the difference of

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:17,220
the sampling means, we saw
two or three videos ago.

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,170
It's the same thing as the mean
of the difference of the

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,715
means of the sampling
distributions.

28
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:28,330
   

29
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,910
And we know that the mean
of each of the sampling

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,160
distributions is actually the
same as the mean of the

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,170
population distributions.

32
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,570
So this is the same thing as
the mean of Population One

33
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,860
minus the mean of
Population Two.

34
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,350
And this was the neat result
about the last video.

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,730
This isn't just a 95% confidence
interval for this

36
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,130
parameter right here.

37
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,600
It's actually a 95% confidence
interval for this parameter

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,200
right here.

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,910
And this is the parameter that
we really care about.

40
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:08,180
The true difference in weight
loss between going on the

41
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,930
low-fat diet and not going
on the low-fat diet.

42
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,390
And we have a 95% confidence
interval that that difference

43
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,250
is between 0.7 and
3.12 pounds.

44
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,320
Which tells us that we have a
95% confidence interval that

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,300
you're definitely going
to lose some weight.

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,410
We're not 100% sure.

47
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,210
We're confident that there's
a 95% probability of that.

48
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,230
Anyway, hopefully that clarifies
it a little bit.

49
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,490
I didn't want to confuse you
too much with that bungled

50
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,620
language that I had at the
end of the last video.

51
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:40,934
