1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
   

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,360
We're on problem number 7.

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,100
Ahmed has two containers of--
oh, look at that, they're

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,070
doing ethnic names now.

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,930
For the first time, someone on
the SAT sounds like they might

6
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,730
be related to me.

7
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,860
Anyway, Ahmed has containers
of two different sizes.

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,210
The total capacity of
16 containers of

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,760
one size is x gallons.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,250
So let's see, so it's
container 1 size

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,700
and container 2 size.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,990
So it's 16 containers of size 1,
so 16 times size 1 is equal

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,240
to x gallons.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,680
   

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,940
And the total capacity of 8
containers on the other side

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,520
is also x gallons.

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,170
So 8 times c2 do is
also x gallons.

18
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,350
   

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,770
And x is greater than
0, of course.

20
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,480
You can't have negative
gallons.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,030
In terms of x, what is the
capacity, in gallons, of each

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,939
of the larger containers?

23
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,010
Let me see what it is.

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,160
Ahmed has containers of
two different sizes.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,700
The total capacity of 16
containers of 1 size is x

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,240
gallons, right.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,060
And the total capacity of 8
containers of the other size

28
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,740
is also x gallons.

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,980
And x is greater than 0.

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,070
In terms of x, what is the
capacity, in gallons, of each

31
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,470
of the larger containers?

32
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:26,800
OK.

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,200
So all we have to know is about
the larger containers.

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,450
Oh, the trick here is which one
is the larger container?

35
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,630
Right, that is the trick
to this question.

36
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,140
So you really need 8 of the
second containers to get x.

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,050
We need 16 of this container
to get to x.

38
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,010
So this is a larger
container, right?

39
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,310
And if we wanted to know the
exact size, you divide both

40
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,190
sides by 8, you get container
2 is equal to x/8 gallons.

41
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,430
And you could have figured
out container 1 is

42
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,220
equal to x/16 gallons.

43
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,090
And something divided by 8 is
going to be bigger than

44
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,935
something divided by 16.

45
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:02,770
So this is our answer.

46
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,450
This is the larger container,
x divided by 8,

47
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,180
that's choice D.

48
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,850
Got to read these problems
carefully.

49
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,260
Next question.

50
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,510
Whoops.

51
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,090
   

52
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,170
Problem 8.

53
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,300
Rectangle a, b, c, d.

54
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,160
I'm still getting over the fact
that they had the name

55
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,740
Ahmed in the SAT.

56
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,660
Anyway, rectangle A, B, C, D.

57
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,330
One day, they'll have a Salman
in there too and I will be

58
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,910
very proud.

59
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,830
That's my full name.

60
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,680
I go by Sal.

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,970
Some people think that I'm not
proud of my ethnicity, but I

62
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,470
explained that's what
my mother called me.

63
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,020
But my full name is Salman.

64
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,300
It's actually Salman Khan, which
is the name of an Indian

65
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,360
actor that gets more
web hits than I do.

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,490
But that's life.

67
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,380
OK, problem eight.

68
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,490
Rectangle A, B, C, D, lies in
the x, y coordinate plane, so

69
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,360
the sides are not parallel
to the axes.

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,615
Well, let me clear this.

71
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,450
I have to focus.

72
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,040
OK.

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,560
It's not parallel to the axes.

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,130
What is the product of the
slopes of all four

75
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,410
sides of A, B, C, D?

76
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,250
Oh, this is fun.

77
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,922
OK.

78
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:12,040
So let me draw it.

79
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,300
So it looks like that,
like that, like

80
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,610
that, like that, roughly.

81
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,970
I didn't draw it perfectly,
but these are

82
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,220
right angles, right?

83
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,730
   

84
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,020
OK.

85
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,860
So let's say the slope of this
line, right here, is m, right?

86
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,910
Well this line's going to be
parallel to this line, so this

87
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,140
is also going to have
a slope of m.

88
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,670
And this is something you
should just memorize.

89
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,980
The slope of a perpendicular
line-- so the slope

90
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,320
perpendicular to this--
is a negative inverse.

91
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,090
So the inverse of m is 1/m,
and it's going to be the

92
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,630
negative inverse.

93
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,060
So the slope of this line right
here is negative 1/m.

94
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,020
And that's something that
you should just

95
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,820
memorize, for life.

96
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,450
And, of course, this one is
parallel to this one.

97
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,735
It's also perpendicular
to these two, so

98
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:01,220
it's also minus 1/m.

99
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,130
So they want to know the product
of all of these.

100
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:12,330
So you get m times minus 1/m
times m times minus 1/m.

101
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,930
m times minus 1/m, this is
minus 1 times minus 1,

102
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,810
which equals 1.

103
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,430
And that is choice D.

104
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,780
Next problem.

105
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,315
This problem is all based on,
did you know that the slope of

106
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,505
a perpendicular line is
a negative inverse?

107
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:33,510
   

108
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,250
Invert colors.

109
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,600
All right.

110
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,080
Problem number 9.

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,210
An hour long television program
includes 20 minutes of

112
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,390
commercials.

113
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,230
What fraction of the hour long
program was not commercials?

114
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,110
So if it had 20 minutes of
commercials, it must have had

115
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,700
40 minutes not commercials,
right?

116
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,140
So 40 minutes over an hour is
the fraction that's not

117
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,640
commercials.

118
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,850
So that's 4/6, which
equals 2/3.

119
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,690
That's the answer.

120
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,720
That's it.

121
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,930
Problem 10.

122
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,740
If the product of 0.3 and a
number is equal to 1-- 0.3 and

123
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,055
a number, the product of 0.3
and a number, I'll say x is

124
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:17,555
equal to 1.

125
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:19,170
So the product of 0.3
and x is equal to

126
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,050
1-- what is the number?

127
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,635
Divide both sides by 0.3.

128
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:26,800
x is equal to 1 divided
by 0.3.

129
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,890
And what is that equal to?

130
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,500
I don't know, can you use
a calculator on this?

131
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,730
   

132
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,770
You could multiply the top
and the bottom by 10.

133
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,510
That is equal to 10/3, which is
equal to 3 and 1/3, which

134
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,310
is equal to-- well, you could
just write 10/3, actually.

135
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,520
Multiply the top and
the bottom of it.

136
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,560
Well, that's also
3.333 repeating

137
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,490
over, and over again.

138
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,470
So you could do it
that way too.

139
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,050
Next problem.

140
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,930
Did I do that right?

141
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,670
Is equal to what?

142
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,980
Right.

143
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,630
That's right.

144
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:06,570
Problem 11.

145
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,565
Let-- oh, I like when they
define these new operations.

146
00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:11,120
   

147
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,990
OK, this is a fun one, x y, z
can be defined as-- so that

148
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:26,150
means x to the y minus
z to the y.

149
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,600
For all positive integers x, y,
and z, what is the value of

150
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,200
triangle 10, 3, 5?

151
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,540
OK.

152
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,590
So what's x?

153
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,400
x is this term.

154
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,220
So it's 10 to the y-- y is this
term, 10 to the third--

155
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,580
minus z, z is this term.

156
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,110
I'm just pattern matching.

157
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,920
So that z is this.

158
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,270
And then my z to
the y, y is 3.

159
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,030
That's all it is.

160
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,110
So it's 10 to the third
minus 5 to the third.

161
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,650
10 to the third is 10 times 10
times 10, which is 1,000,

162
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,100
minus 5 times 5 times
5, which is 125.

163
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,890
And so that's what?

164
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,730
That's 875.

165
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,680
And we are done.

166
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,930
Next problem.

167
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:15,890
   

168
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,400
OK, draw a rectangle.

169
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,040
Let's see, they have a
rectangle that looks

170
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,740
something like that.

171
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:27,485
And then there's a line there.

172
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:40,940
And these are points P,
Q, R, S, T, and U.

173
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,430
And the figure above P, Q,
S, T is a rectangle.

174
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,200
And U, R, S, T is a square.

175
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,100
So this is a square.

176
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,650
Fair enough.

177
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,150
So that means this
side's equal.

178
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,720
P, U is equal to 5.

179
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,420
So this is equal to 5.

180
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,110
And U, T is a positive
integer.

181
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,090
U, T is an integer, So
that's interesting.

182
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,790
We know it's an integer, and we
know it can't be negative.

183
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,800
You can't have a negative side
of a square in our universe.

184
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,420
If the area of P, Q, S, T must
be more than 10-- so area is

185
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,600
greater than 10 and
less than 30.

186
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,610
Area is less than 30, so
we can write this way.

187
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:30,710
Area less than 30-- what is one
possible value of U, T?

188
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,090
Well let's just say that
U, T is x, right?

189
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,309
And this is a square, so
this is x, and this

190
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,429
is x as well, right?

191
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,490
And so what is the area
of this big thing?

192
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,130
It's going to be this
side which is what?

193
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,880
5 plus x times this
side, which is x.

194
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,430
So that's going to
be the area.

195
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:57,050
So it's going to be
5x plus x squared.

196
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,500
And so that's the area.

197
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,860
And it has to be between these
two spaces, right?

198
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,090
So we could try out
some numbers.

199
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,130
Let's see, if x is 1
what's the area?

200
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,240
It's 5 plus 1.

201
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,650
So then the area is 7.

202
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,850
No, that's not greater
than 10.

203
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,130
What happens if x
is equal to 2?

204
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,150
Then we have 5 times
of x is 2.

205
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,760
You have 7 times
2, which is 14.

206
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,690
And that satisfies
these conditions.

207
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,230
14 is greater than 10
and less than 30.

208
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,190
So that's it.

209
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,100
You didn't even have to do x.

210
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,610
You could have just said well,
what if x is, you could have

211
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,950
tried 1, and just tried 2.

212
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,020
And you could say 5 plus
2 is 7 times 2 is 14.

213
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,900
That meets my conditions,
and I am done.

214
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,240
That's all you've got to do.

215
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,150
I'll see you in the
next video.
