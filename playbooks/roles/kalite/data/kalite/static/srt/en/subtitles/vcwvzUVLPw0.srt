1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,830
What I want to do in this
videos is to make to

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,325
parametrizations of essentially
the same curve, but we're going

4
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:08,710
to go along the curve
a different rates.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,610
And hopefully we'll be able to
use that to understand, or get

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,580
a better intuition, behind what
exactly it means to take a

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,560
derivative of a position
vector valued function.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,080
So let's say my first
parametrization, I have

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,050
x of t is equal to t.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,990
And let's say that y of t
is equal to t squared.

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:36,570
And this is true for t is
greater than or equal to 0,

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,060
and less than or equal to 2.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,020
And if I want to write this
as a position vector valued

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,975
function, let me write this.

15
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:50,240
x1, call that y1, and let me
write my position vector valued

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,707
function; I could say r1-- I'm
numbering them because I'm

17
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,910
going to do a different version
of this exact same curve with a

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,020
slightly different
parametrization --so r1 one of

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,150
t, we could say is x1 of t
times i-- the unit vector i

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,300
--so we'll just say t times i
plus-- this is just x of t

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,410
right here, or x1 of t; I'm
numbering them because I'll

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:20,940
later have an x2 t --plus
t squared times j.

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,940
And if I wanted to graph this,
I'm going to be very careful

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,860
graphing it because I really
want to understand what the

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,090
derivative means here.

26
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,740
   

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,040
Try to draw it
roughly to scale.

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:43,080
So let's say that this is
one, two, three, four.

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,240
Then let me draw my x-axis.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,430
That's good enough.

31
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,000
And my x-axis, I want it to be
roughly to scale, one and two.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,500
And so at t equals 0, both my x
and y coordinates are at 0-- or

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,060
this is just going to be the 0
vector, so this is where we are

34
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,710
a t equals 0 --at t equals 1
this is going to be one times

35
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,800
i-- we're going to be just
like that --plus 1 times j.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,320
1 squared is j, so we're
going to be right there.

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,470
And then at t is equal to 2,
we're going to be at 2i.

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,410
So 2i-- you could imagine 2
times i would be this vector

39
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,560
right there --2 times i plus
4-- 2 squared is 4 --4 times

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,770
j, so plus 4 times j.

41
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,610
If you add these two vectors
heads to tails, you're going

42
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,370
to get a vector that's
end point is right there.

43
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,050
The vector is going to
look something like this.

44
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,980
   

45
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,830
So this is what, just to
make it clear what we're

46
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,230
doing, that's r1 of 2.

47
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,740
This is r1 of 0.

48
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,130
This is r1 of 1.

49
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,150
But the bottom line is the
path looks like this:

50
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,090
it's a parabola.

51
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,040
So the path will
look like that.

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,840
Now that's in my first
parametrization of it.

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,470
Actually, let me draw a
little bit more carefully.

54
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,110
I want to get rid of this
arrows, just because I want it

55
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,210
to be a nice clean drawing.

56
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,185
So it's going to be a parabola.

57
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:16,250
   

58
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,510
Let me get rid of that other
point, too, just because I

59
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,550
didn't draw it exactly where
it needs to be; it needs

60
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,170
to be right there.

61
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,810
And my parabola, or part of
my parabola is going to

62
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,360
look something like that.

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,780
All right.

64
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,290
Good enough.

65
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,520
So this is the first
parametrization.

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,390
Now I'm going to do this exact
same curve, but I'm going to

67
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,160
do it slightly differently.

68
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,660
So let's say I'll do it
in different colors.

69
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,400
So x2 of t, let's it equals 2t.

70
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,570
And y2 of t, let's say
it's equal to 2t squared.

71
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,330
Or we could alternatively write
that, that's the same thing as

72
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,290
4t squared, just phrasing
both of these guys

73
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,340
to the second power.

74
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,080
   

75
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,980
And then let's say instead of
going from t equals 0 to 2,

76
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,110
we're going to go from
t goes from 0 to 1.

77
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,460
But we're going to see,
we're going to cover

78
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,390
the exact same path.

79
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:22,220
And our second position vector
valued function, r2 of t, is

80
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,740
going to be equal to 2t times i
plus-- I could say 2t squared

81
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,650
--4t squared times j.

82
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,940
And if I were to graph this guy
right here, it would look

83
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,780
like-- let me draw my axes
again; it's going to look the

84
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,000
same, but it's I think useful
to draw it because I'm going to

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,170
draw the derivatives and
all that on it later.

86
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,370
One, two, three, four.

87
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,680
One, two.

88
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,980
And then let's see what happens
when t is equal to 0-- or r of

89
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,100
0; all these are going to be 0,
we're just going to have the

90
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,420
zero vector; x and y are both
equal to 0 --when t is equal

91
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,820
to 1/2 what are we
going to get here?

92
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,530
1/2 times 2 is 1.

93
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,300
And then we're going to
get the point 1/2 squared

94
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,330
is 1/4 times 4 is 1.

95
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,110
So when t is equal 1/2 we're
going to be at the point 1, 1.

96
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,690
And when the t is equal
to 1 we're going to

97
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,730
be at the point 2, 4.

98
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,570
   

99
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,595
So notice the curve is
exactly, the path we go

100
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:40,290
is exactly the same.

101
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,840
But before we even do the
derivatives, these two

102
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,310
paths are identical.

103
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,590
I want to think
about something.

104
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:51,010
Let's pretend that our
parameter, t, really is time.

105
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,230
And that tends to be the
most common, that's

106
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,210
why they call it t.

107
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,260
It doesn't have to be time,
but let's say it is time.

108
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,540
So what's happening here?

109
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,290
In the first parametrization
when we go from 0 to 2

110
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,680
seconds we cover this path.

111
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,900
You can imagine after 1
second the dot moves here,

112
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,463
then it moves there.

113
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:10,310
You can imagine a dot moving
along this curve, and it

114
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,090
takes two seconds to do so.

115
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,580
In this situation we have a dot
moving along the same curve,

116
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,230
but it's able to cover the same
curve in only one second; and

117
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,530
half a second it gets here.

118
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,390
It took this guy one
second to get here.

119
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,810
In a one second, this guy's all
the way over here; this guy

120
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,610
takes two seconds
to go over here.

121
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,960
So in this second
parametrization even though the

122
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,580
path is the same, the curves
are the same, the

123
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,585
dot is faster.

124
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:36,580
   

125
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,790
I want you to keep that in
mind when we think about

126
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,030
the derivatives of both
of these position vector

127
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,630
valued functions.

128
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,860
So just remember the dot is
moving faster for every second

129
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,616
it's getting further along the
curve than here; that's why it

130
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:51,930
only took them one second.

131
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,410
Now let's look at the
derivatives of both

132
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,840
of these guys.

133
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:03,540
So the derivative here, so if I
were to write r prime, r1 prime

134
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,320
of t-- let me do that in a
different color, actually,

135
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,230
already used the orange; so let
me do it in the blue

136
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,320
--r1 prime us t.

137
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,650
So the is the derivative now.

138
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,190
It's going to be, remember,
it's just the derivative of

139
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,490
each of these times
the unit vectors.

140
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,570
So the derivative of t with
respect to t, that's just 1.

141
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,920
So it's 1 times i.

142
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,940
I'll just write 1i plus-- I
didn't have to write the one

143
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,210
there --plus the derivative
of t squared with respect

144
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,132
to t is 2t plus 2t j.

145
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,690
And let me take the
derivative over here.

146
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,310
r2 prime of t.

147
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,120
The derivative of 2t with
respect to t is 2, so

148
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,960
2i, plus the derivative
of 4t squared is 8t.

149
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,520
2 times 4, it is rt.

150
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,460
   

151
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,410
Just like that.

152
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,180
   

153
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:10,400
Now the question is, what do
their respective derivative

154
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,050
vectors look like at
different points?

155
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,680
So let's look at, I don't know,
let's see how fast they're

156
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,350
moving when time is equal to 1.

157
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,020
So let's take it at
a specific point.

158
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,800
This is just the general
formula, but let's figure

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,150
out what the derivative
is at a specific point.

160
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:31,240
So let's take r1 when
time is equal to 1.

161
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,110
And I want to take this
specific point on the curve,

162
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,320
not the specific point in time.

163
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,750
So this point on the curve
here is when time is equal

164
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,090
to 1, you could say second.

165
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,150
This point over here, which
is the exact corresponding

166
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,070
point, is when time
is equal 1/2 second.

167
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,660
So r1 of 1 is equal to--
we're taking the derivative

168
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,950
there --is equal to 1i.

169
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,270
It's not dependent on t at all.

170
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:01,980
So it's 1i plus 2
times 1j, so plus 2j.

171
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,720
So at this point the derivative
of our position vector function

172
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,440
is going to be 1i plus 2j.

173
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,150
So we can draw it like this. so
if we do 1i is like this: 1i.

174
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,670
And then 2j.

175
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,390
Just 2j is like that.

176
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,130
So our derivative right there,
I'll do it in the same

177
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,200
color that I wrote it in.

178
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
It's in this green color; it's
going to look like this.

179
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,260
   

180
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,240
And notice it looks like, at
least its direction is-- let me

181
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:39,820
do it a little bit straighter
--its direction looks tangent

182
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,900
to the curve; it's going in
the direction that my

183
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,700
particle is moving.

184
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,270
Remember my particle is moving
from here to there, so it's

185
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,400
going in the direction.

186
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,730
And I'm going to think about,
in a second, what this length

187
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,610
of this to derivative
vector is.

188
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,210
This right here, just to
be clear is, r1 prime.

189
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:59,610
It's a vector, so it's telling
us the instantaneous change in

190
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,540
our position vector with
respect to t, or time, when

191
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,970
time is equal to 1 second.

192
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,400
That's this thing right here.

193
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,390
Now let's take the exact same
position here on our curve.

194
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,450
But that's going to occur at a
different time for this guy.

195
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,960
We already said it only takes
him, he's here at time

196
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,320
is equal to 1/2 second.

197
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,850
So let's take-- --I'll
do it in the same color

198
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,340
--so here we have r2.

199
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,010
We're going to evaluate it at
1/2 half because this is at

200
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,570
time is equal 1/2 second.

201
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,590
And this is going to be equal
to 2i-- this isn't dependent

202
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:36,510
at all on time --so 2i
plus 8 times the time.

203
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,430
So time right here is 1/2.

204
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,650
So 8 times 1/2 is 4.

205
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,920
So plus 4j.

206
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,610
So what does this look like?

207
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,220
The instantaneous
derivative here.

208
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,640
Oh, and this is the derivative;
have to be very clear.

209
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,130
So 2i-- let me draw some
more --so 2i maybe gets

210
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,510
us about that far.

211
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,350
Plus 4j will get us up
to right around there.

212
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,800
Plus 4j is that factor.

213
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,950
So when you add those two heads
to tails, you get this thing:

214
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,800
you get something that-- let me
like --you get something

215
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,065
that looks like that.

216
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:15,590
   

217
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,070
I didn't draw it as neatly
as I would like to.

218
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,370
But let's notice something:
both of these vectors are going

219
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,820
in the exact same direction.

220
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,550
They're both tangential to
the path, to our curve.

221
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,340
But this vector is going, its
length, its magnitude, is

222
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,050
much larger than this
vector's magnitude.

223
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,610
And that makes sense because I
hinted at it when we first

224
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,960
talked about these vector
valued position functions and

225
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,650
their derivatives; is that the
length, you can kind of

226
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,480
view it as the speed.

227
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,420
The length is equal to the
speed if you imagine t being

228
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,900
time and these parametrizations
are representing a dot

229
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,320
moving along these curves.

230
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,080
So in this case, the particle
only takes a second to go

231
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,390
there, so at this point in its
path, it's moving much faster

232
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,810
than this particle is.

233
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,540
So if you think about it, this
vector right here, if you

234
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,715
imagine this is a position
factor, this is velocity.

235
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:14,980
   

236
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,330
Velocity is speed
plus the direction.

237
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,630
Speed is just you know,
how fast are you going?

238
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,930
Velocity is how fast you're
going in what direction?

239
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,590
I'm going this fast-- and you
could calculate it using the

240
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,260
Pythagorean Theorem, but I just
want to give you the intuition

241
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,430
right here --I'm going that
fast in this direction.

242
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,770
Here I'm going this fast;
I'm going even faster.

243
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,340
That's my magnitude,
but I'm still going in

244
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,710
the same direction.

245
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,240
So hopefully you have a gut
feeling now of what the

246
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,380
derivative of these position
vectors really are.

247
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,866
