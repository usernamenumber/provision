1
00:00:00,661 --> 00:00:05,597
Contango can be one of the more difficult to comprehend ideas

2
00:00:05,597 --> 00:00:08,339
when we talk about futures markets, but it's really because

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,876
it's used in different contexts all the time,

4
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:12,910
with slightly different meanings depending upon

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,397
whether you're talking about someone participating in a futures market

6
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:18,743
or whether an academic is talking about it,

7
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:21,160
but first let me give you the proper definition.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,979
So the proper definition of contango, it's actually a theory

9
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:29,572
and it really can't be observed.

10
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:35,404
And Contango Theory says that people are willing to pay more

11
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:39,167
to buy some commodity in the future

12
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:42,350
than the actually expected price of that commodity

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,800
so, when we talk about expected price, this is a very theoretical thing

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,515
if you were to go and survey everyone participating

15
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:50,915
in the futures market and say,

16
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:55,242
"What price do you think silver will be in 8 months?"

17
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:57,505
And if they all, you know, you took your survey,

18
00:00:57,505 --> 00:01:02,263
and they all told you the 100% answer, you could get this theoretical expected price

19
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:06,334
and maybe that theoretical expected price is $33

20
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:12,344
so this right here is the expected price of silver in the market

21
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:14,999
and you could see from this futures curve right here

22
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:20,731
that delivery, the silver futures contract for delivery

23
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:22,840
(expected)

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,839
for delivery 8 months from now is trading above that

25
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:28,261
it's trading above the expected price,

26
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:31,475
and it's probably trading above the expected price

27
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:35,047
because people don't want to, people who what to have silver in 8 months

28
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:40,099
they don't want to buy it today and have to go rent some space and have to store the silver

29
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,332
and have to insure the silver, and worry about someone

30
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:44,248
maybe stealing the silver, they'd rather

31
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:48,039
just pay for a premium in order for it, to have it be delivered

32
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:54,105
in the future. So this is kind of the correct academic description of Contango Theory

33
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:58,198
The theory that the futures price, on a future delivery date,

34
00:01:58,198 --> 00:02:01,364
is going to be higher than what the market actually expects

35
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:04,456
so people to some degree are paying a premium

36
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:10,658
to have the delivery of the silver, to have it delayed.

37
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:13,365
Now, in practice, you will hear people say that a market

38
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:17,466
is "in contango," and usually what they are talking about

39
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:19,352
they're usually talking about one of two things,

40
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:23,260
and they're related, but usually if they're a little bit more correct about it

41
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,888
they're talking about the idea that the futures price.

42
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:33,300
is, over time, going to converge downward to the actual spot price

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,949
So what I've done here, so this is the futures curve,

44
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:39,635
so this is just the price, the delivery price of the different contracts

45
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,893
going forward in time. But this is the delivery price,

46
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:47,262
the market delivery price today, right now. This is how things trend over time

47
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:51,313
so in magenta, I have the spot price trending over time

48
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:55,069
right over there. And then you can see that you have the 4 month

49
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,594
the contract that's for delivery in 4 months, today

50
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:03,665
it's price is a little bit under $35, but as you approach it's actual delivery date

51
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:05,652
so now we're actually moving forward in time

52
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,619
it has to converge to the spot price,

53
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:10,148
otherwise people could make free money on that day.

54
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,235
And so the delivery date 8 months out,

55
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:15,062
has to converge to the spot price eventually,

56
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,338
and so what you see is, is because the spot price

57
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:22,784
hasn't moved up a lot, and you see this downward converging of the different

58
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:26,319
futures price, this is what people normally refer to

59
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,892
when they say a market is in contango,

60
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:33,207
when you see the delivery price of a certain futures contract

61
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:37,354
converge downward to the actual spot price

62
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:39,728
so all of these are converging downward over time

63
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:41,751
so it's something that you would have to observe over time

64
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:45,285
not something that you would traditionally just be able to look at a futures curve

65
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,642
but in general when you have this,

66
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:50,769
you normally see that the futures delivery prices are

67
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,056
higher the further out you go, so you have this upward

68
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:55,655
sloping futures curve.

69
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:59,208
So the simplest kind of analysis when people say something is "in contango,"

70
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,239
they'll just look at an upward sloping futures curve

71
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,720
or a normal curve

72
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,180
and then say "this is also in contango"

73
00:04:05,180 --> 99:59:59,999
but this isn't exactly right, it's really this movement over time.
