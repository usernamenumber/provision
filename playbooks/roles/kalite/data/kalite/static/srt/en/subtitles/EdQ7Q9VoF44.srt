1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,530
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,140
We're finally using the Laplace
Transform to do

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,460
something useful.

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,880
In the first part of this
problem, we just had this

6
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,850
fairly straightforward
differential equation.

7
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,730
And I know it's a little bit
frustrating right now, because

8
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,650
you're like, this is such an
easy one to solve using the

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,260
characteristic equation.

10
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,640
Why are we doing Laplace
Transforms?

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,410
Well I just want to show you
that they can solve even these

12
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,660
problems. But later on there
are going to be classes of

13
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,650
problems that, frankly, our
traditional methods aren't as

14
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,500
good as the Laplace Transform.

15
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,790
But anyway, how did
we solve this?

16
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,850
We just took the Laplace
Transform of both sides of

17
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,870
this equation.

18
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,540
We got all of this hairy mess.

19
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,145
We used the property of the
derivative of functions, where

20
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:38,030
you take the Laplace Transform,
and we ended up,

21
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,100
after doing a lot of algebra
essentially, we got this.

22
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,110
We got the Laplace Transform of
y is equal to this thing.

23
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,330
We just took the Laplace
Transform of both sides and

24
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,170
manipulated algebraically.

25
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,540
So now our task in this video
is to figure out what y's

26
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,786
Laplace Transform
is this thing?

27
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,070
And essentially what we're
trying to do, is we're trying

28
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,250
to take the inverse Laplace
Transform of both sides of

29
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:58,810
this equation.

30
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,010
So another way to say it, we
could say that y-- if we take

31
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,247
the inverse Laplace Transform
of both sides-- we could say

32
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:09,190
that y is equal to the
inverse Laplace

33
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,260
Transform of this thing.

34
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:19,372
2s plus 13, over s squared
plus 5s plus 6.

35
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:21,780
Now we'll eventually actually
learn the formal definition of

36
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,600
the inverse Laplace Transform.

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,040
How do you go from the s
domain to the t domain?

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,210
Or how do you go from
the frequency

39
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,880
domain to the time domain?

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,010
We're not going to worry
about that right now.

41
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,330
What we're going to do is we're
going to get this into a

42
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,750
form that we recognize,
and say, oh,

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,180
I know those functions.

44
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,200
That's the Laplace Transform
of whatever and whatever.

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,270
And then we'll know what y is.

46
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,230
So let's try to do that.

47
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,750
So what we're going to use is
something that you probably

48
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,970
haven't used since Algebra two,
which is I think when

49
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,720
it's taught in, you know,
eighth, ninth,

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,680
or 10th grade, depending.

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,740
And you finally see it now in
differential equations that it

52
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,640
actually has some use.

53
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,450
Let me write it.

54
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,780
We're going to use partial
fraction expansion.

55
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,080
And I'll do a little primer
on that, in case you don't

56
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,740
remember it.

57
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,539
So anyway, let's just factor
the bottom part right here.

58
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,510
And you'll see where I'm
going with this.

59
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:19,130
So if I factor the bottom, I get
s plus 2 times s plus 3.

60
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:25,420
And what we want to do, is we
want to rewrite this fraction

61
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,980
as the sum of 2-- I
guess you could

62
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,570
call it partial fractions.

63
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,230
I think that's why it's called
partial fraction expansion.

64
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:41,110
So we want to write this as a
sum of A over s plus 2, plus B

65
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,250
over s plus 3.

66
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,280
And if we can do this, then--
and bells might already be

67
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,710
ringing in your head-- we know
that these things that look

68
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,650
like this are the Laplace
Transform of functions that

69
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,960
we've already solved for.

70
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,110
And I'll do a little review
on that in a second.

71
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,680
But anyway, how do we
figure out A and B?

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
Well if we were to actually add
A and B, if we were to--

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,850
let's do a little aside right
here-- so if we said that A--

74
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,480
so if we were to give them a
common denominator, which is

75
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,295
this, s plus 2 times s plus 3.

76
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:22,750
Then what would A become?

77
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,350
We'd have to multiply A
times s plus 3, right?

78
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,030
So we'd get As plus 3A.

79
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,640
   

80
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,220
This, as I've written it right
now, is the same thing as A

81
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,980
over s plus 2.

82
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,080
You could cancel out an s plus
3 in the top and the bottom.

83
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
And now we're going to
add the B to it.

84
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,500
So plus-- I'll do that in a
different color-- plus-- well,

85
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,110
if we have this as the
denominator, we could multiply

86
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,140
the numerator and
the denominator

87
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,100
by s plus 2, right?

88
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:58,890
To get B times s, plus
2B, and that's going

89
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,470
to equal this thing.

90
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,360
And all I did is I added
these two fractions.

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,350
Nothing fancier than there.

92
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,920
That was Algebra two.

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,230
Actually, I think I should
do an actual

94
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,335
video on that as well.

95
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:11,410
But that's going to
equal this thing.

96
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:20,899
2s plus 13, all of that over
s plus 2 times s plus 3.

97
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,250
Notice in all differential
equations, the hairiest part's

98
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,690
always the algebra.

99
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,780
So now what we do
is we match up.

100
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,110
We say, well, let's add
the s terms here.

101
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,440
And we could say that the
numerators have to equal each

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,350
other, because the denominators
are equal.

103
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:51,960
So we have A plus Bs plus 3A
plus 2B is equal to 2s plus B.

104
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,110
So the coefficient on s, on
the right-hand side, is 2.

105
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,910
The coefficient on the left-hand
side is A plus B, so

106
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,980
we know that A plus
B is equal to 2.

107
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,950
   

108
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,270
And then on the right-hand side,
we see 3A plus 2B must

109
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,150
be equal to-- oh,
this is a 13.

110
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,930
Did I say B?

111
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,190
This is a 13.

112
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,530
That's a 13.

113
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,890
It looks just like a B, right?

114
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,100
That was 2s plus 13.

115
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:28,640
Anyway, so on the right-hand
side I get, it was 3A plus 2B

116
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,150
is equal to 13.

117
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,790
Now we have two equations
with two unknowns,

118
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,610
and what do we get?

119
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,250
I know this is very tiresome,
but it'll be

120
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,260
satisfying in the end.

121
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,460
Because you'll actually
solve something

122
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,515
with the Laplace Transform.

123
00:05:40,515 --> 00:05:43,660
So let's multiply the top
equation by 2, or let's just

124
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,350
say minus 2.

125
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:50,320
So we get minus 2A minus
2B equals minus 4.

126
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,240
And then we get-- add the two
equations-- you get A is equal

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,170
to-- these cancel out--
A is equal to 9.

128
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,000
Great.

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,530
If A is equal to 9, what
is B equal to?

130
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,520
B is equal to 9 plus
what is equal to 2?

131
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,130
Or 2 minus 9 is minus 7.

132
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,160
And we have done some serious
simplification.

133
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,770
Because now we can rewrite this
whole expression as the

134
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:23,390
Laplace Transform of y is equal
to A over s plus 2, is

135
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:34,060
equal to 9 over s plus 2,
minus 7 over s plus 3.

136
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,810
Or another way of writing it, we
could write it as equal to

137
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:47,620
9 times 1 over s plus 2, minus
7 times 1 over s plus 3.

138
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,630
Why did I take the trouble
to do this?

139
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,920
Well hopefully, you'll recognize
this was actually

140
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,010
the second Laplace Transform
we figured out.

141
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,200
   

142
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,290
What was that?

143
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,950
I'll write it down here just
so you remember it.

144
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:11,970
It was the Laplace Transform of
e to the at, was equal to 1

145
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,000
over s minus a.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,070
That was the second Laplace
Transform we figured out.

147
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,200
So this is interesting.

148
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,880
This is the Laplace
Transform of what?

149
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,730
So if we were to take the
inverse Laplace Transform--

150
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,900
actually let me just
stay consistent.

151
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,820
So that means that this is the
Laplace Transform of y, is

152
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,360
equal to 9 times the Laplace
Transform of what?

153
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,850
If we just do pattern matching,
if this is s minus

154
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,080
a, then a is minus 2.

155
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,220
So 9 times the Laplace
Transform of e

156
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,970
to the minus 2t.

157
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,380
Does that make sense?

158
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,900
Take this, put it in this one,
which we figured out, and you

159
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,190
get 1 over s plus 2.

160
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,205
And let me clean this up a
little bit, because I'm going

161
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:57,455
to need that real estate.

162
00:07:57,455 --> 00:08:02,450
   

163
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,120
I'll write this.

164
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,270
I'll leave that there, because
we'll still use that.

165
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,800
And then we have minus 7 times--
this is the Laplace

166
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,500
Transform of what?

167
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,190
This is the Laplace Transform
of e to the minus 3t.

168
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,450
   

169
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:25,190
This pattern matching, you're
like, wow, if you saw this,

170
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,270
you would go to your Laplace
Transform table, if you didn't

171
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,640
remember it, you'd see this.

172
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,430
You're like, wow, that looks
a lot like that.

173
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,000
I just have to figure
out what a is.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,960
I have s plus 3.

175
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
I have s minus a.

176
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,520
So in this case, a is
equal to minus 3.

177
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,894
So if a is equal to minus 3,
this is the Laplace Transform

178
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,760
of e to the minus 3t.

179
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,390
So now we can take the inverse
Laplace-- actually,

180
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,070
before we do that.

181
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,750
We know that because the Laplace
Transform is a linear

182
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,760
operator-- and actually now I
can delete this down here-- we

183
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,140
know that the Laplace Transform
is a linear

184
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,110
operator, so we can
write this.

185
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,710
And you normally wouldn't go
through all of these steps.

186
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,530
I just really want to make you
understand what we're doing.

187
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,140
So we could say that this is the
same thing as the Laplace

188
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:16,700
Transform of 9e to the minus 2t,
minus 7e to the minus 3t.

189
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,570
   

190
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,860
Now we have something
interesting.

191
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,400
The Laplace Transform of y
is equal to the Laplace

192
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,830
Transform of this.

193
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:30,570
Well if that's the case, then
y must be equal to 9e to the

194
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,320
minus 2t, minus 7e
to the minus 3t.

195
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,080
And I never proved to you, but
the Laplace Transform is

196
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,300
actually a 1:1 Transformation.

197
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,330
That if a function's Laplace
Transform, if I take a

198
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,420
function against the Laplace
Transform, and then if I were

199
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,810
take the inverse Laplace
Transform, the only function

200
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,820
whose Laplace Transform
that that is, is

201
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,710
that original function.

202
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,550
It's not like two different
functions can have the same

203
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,050
Laplace Transform.

204
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,680
Anyway, a couple of things
to think about here.

205
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,070
Notice, we had that thing that
kind of looked like a

206
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,980
characteristic equation
pop up here and there.

207
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,340
And we still have to solve a
system of two equations with

208
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:08,850
two unknowns.

209
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,750
Those are both things that we
had to do when we solve an

210
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,030
initial value problem, when we
use just traditional, the

211
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,340
characteristic equation.

212
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,150
But here it happened
all at once.

213
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,900
And frankly it was a little bit
hairier because we had to

214
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,040
do all this partial fraction
expansion.

215
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,050
But it's pretty neat.

216
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,210
The Laplace Transform got
us something useful.

217
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,970
In the next video I'll actually
do a non-homogeneous

218
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,850
equation, and show you that the
Laplace Transform applies

219
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,830
equally well there.

220
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,680
So it's kind of a more
consistent theory of solving

221
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,730
differential equations, instead
of kind of guessing

222
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,140
solutions, and solving for
coefficients and all of that.

223
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,100
See you in the next video.

224
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,400
