1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,680
Let's see if we can develop some
intuition as to why the

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,640
equilibrium constant equation
looks the way it does.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,420
Just as review, this is it:
equilibrium constant.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,920
It would be the concentration
of our molecule Y raised to

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,380
its coefficient power or, if
we're thinking in moles,

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,330
raised to the number of moles.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,580
If we think of these as kind
of the mole ratios, or the

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,600
molar ratios-- or we could
just view them as the

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,250
molecular ratios, either way--
times the concentration of our

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,320
molecule Z.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,052
Now, we're not doing
some calculus here.

13
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:39,615
d is just the number of moles we
need of Z for every c moles

14
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:41,940
of Y, b moles of X,
and a moles of V.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,900
So it's Z to the d power divided
by the concentration

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,760
of V to the a power and
X to the b power.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,760
So it's a nice, little, clean
equation, but why does

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,930
it look this way?

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,670
And I actually made a video
earlier today where I started

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,390
exploring this with
natural logs.

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,300
And I think I got someplace,
but that one

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,170
started to break down.

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,910
And I think I've come up with a
much simpler reason why this

24
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,420
looks this way.

25
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,450
So I've deleted that video, and
I think I've come up with

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,250
a much more intuitive one that
explains more of why this

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,870
works and actually some of the
other things we're going to

28
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,490
learn about the equilibrium
constants in future videos.

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,590
So what makes a reaction
happen?

30
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,370
Or what does equilibrium mean?

31
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,540
It means the rate at which the
forward reaction is happening.

32
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:39,670
So that means that the rate of
this happening, of V plus X

33
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,540
turning into Y plus Z--
I can't forget the

34
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:51,380
coefficients-- is going to be
equal to the reverse reaction,

35
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,000
is equal to the rate of
the reverse reaction.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,860
So our c moles of Y plus d moles
of Z turning and going

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,140
the other way, turning
into the V and the X

38
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,830
with certain ratios.

39
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,210
It doesn't mean necessarily that
the concentrations are

40
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,220
the same, because we could
have one where we end up

41
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,140
heavily favoring the
forward reaction.

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,800
Where we end up with much higher
concentrations of Y and

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,170
Z, or we might heavily favor the
backwards reactions where

44
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,900
we have more V and X.

45
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,680
But when we're in equilibrium,
we're saying that our

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,810
concentrations have reached a
stability point, which implies

47
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,720
that the rate of going in this
direction is equal to the rate

48
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,570
going into that direction.

49
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,530
So let's just think a little
bit about what drives these

50
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,530
rates, what drives these
rates of reactions.

51
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,070
In order for this forward
reaction to happen that I drew

52
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,240
in purple, what needs
to happen?

53
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,740
We have to have a molecules
of V roughly.

54
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,470
And let's say in any volume of
space, we have to have some V

55
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:56,780
molecules, and preferably a
V molecules, being in the

56
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,030
vicinity of b X molecules.

57
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,700
So there's got to be b of these
X molecules, and they

58
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,350
have to be in the right
configuration and in the right

59
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,130
place and kind of close
enough in order for

60
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,560
the reaction to happen.

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,160
So the reaction is really going
to be driven by, if you

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,190
think about it, the probability
of finding a V

63
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:23,300
molecules and b molecules all
within close enough confines

64
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,450
that they can actually react.

65
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:31,470
So you could say that the rate
is going to be driven by--

66
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,550
maybe it's going to
be proportional.

67
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,060
Let's say it's just equal to--
let's say some constant that

68
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,820
takes into account things like
temperature and how the

69
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,310
molecules are actually
configured.

70
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,480
Because it's not dependent
just on them being there.

71
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,600
You have to have worry about
their kinetic energies.

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,800
You have to worry about their
shape, because some shapes are

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,120
going to be more conducive
to reaction than others.

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,310
So let's just let that be taken
into account with a K.

75
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,870
And we're talking about the
forward reaction, right?

76
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,810
So in order for the forward
reaction to happen, let's call

77
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,250
that K plus for the
forward reaction.

78
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,960
We have to have a molecules of
V there and b molecules of X.

79
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,410
So what's the probability of
having a molecules of X?

80
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,870
Or what's a rough approximation
of the

81
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,660
probability?

82
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,910
Well, the concentration.

83
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,740
   

84
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,190
Let's think about
this a second.

85
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,250
When we write the concentration
of the molecule

86
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,010
V, which I think when I did this
was the blue one right

87
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,230
here, what is that given in?

88
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,370
That is given in moles
per liter.

89
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,540
Moles is just a number, so this
tells us, look, in any

90
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,560
given volume, roughly how
many of the molecules do

91
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,670
you expect to find?

92
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,570
That's what concentration is.

93
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,060
So if I wanted to figure out the
probability of finding a

94
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,240
of these molecules, because
that's how many I need, I need

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,970
to multiply this by
itself a times,

96
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,860
because I need a of them.

97
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,860
The probability of having just
one molecule in just some

98
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,260
small fraction, you would just
use the concentration once.

99
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,400
But you're going to use it a
times, because you want a of

100
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,600
those molecules there, right?

101
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,860
You could look at it like what's
the probability of

102
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,810
having five heads?

103
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,190
Well you would multiply
the probability of

104
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,180
one head five times.

105
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,220
So the forward reaction
probability is going to be the

106
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:18,740
concentration of V to the a
power, and, of course, that's

107
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,610
not enough to have the
reaction happen.

108
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:27,160
You also need to have b of
the X molecules there.

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,530
So you have the concentration
of X to the b power.

110
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,690
And I want to make sure
you understand this.

111
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,590
   

112
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,000
My claim is that this is
approximation-- or actually

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,690
it's a pretty good way of
calculating-- the probability.

114
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,420
So let me write it this way.

115
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,770
The rate is equal to some
constant that takes into

116
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,310
account the temperature and the
molecular configurations

117
00:05:53,310 --> 00:06:06,680
times the probability of having
a V molecules and b X

118
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,690
molecules in a sufficiently
small area

119
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,320
all at the same time.

120
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,280
And the best way to approximate
that is with their

121
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,970
concentration.

122
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,620
Obviously, the higher the
concentration, the higher the

123
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,800
moles per liter, the more likely
you're going to find

124
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,140
that many of molecules in kind
of that little small space

125
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,880
that you care about, and
the temperature and the

126
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,740
configuration are going
to matter more.

127
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,700
But if you use the concentration
as the

128
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,000
probability of a-- let
me switch colors.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:48,710
If the probability of having a V
molecule in some volume-- if

130
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,800
we assume that the solution
is homogeneous, that the V

131
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,720
molecules are roughly evenly
distributed, it's going to

132
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,210
be-- this isn't even
an approximation.

133
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,540
It's going to be the
concentration of the V

134
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,650
molecules times the volume under
which we care about.

135
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:12,890
If we want the probability of
a, where a is a number, it

136
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:24,390
could be five V molecules, a V's
in some volume, it's the

137
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,545
probability of finding
this a times.

138
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:30,430
So it's going to be equal to--
and this is just from the

139
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,790
probability concepts that
we learned in the whole

140
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,250
probability playlist.

141
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,520
So if you want to have five
heads in a row, it's 1/2 to

142
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,170
the fifth power.

143
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,970
If you want to have V molecules
there, five of them

144
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,750
at the same time in some volume,
or a of them, it's

145
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,020
going to be V to the a power
times the volume.

146
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,600
If you also care about the
probability so you want all of

147
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:07,052
that, so a V's and b X's in some
volume, then you're going

148
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:08,380
to have to multiply all
of them together.

149
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,910
So it's going to be equal to the
concentration of V to the

150
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,720
a power times the concentration
of X to the b

151
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,800
power times the volume.

152
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,900
So the probability of finding
the right number of V

153
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,480
particles and X particles in the
right place in some volume

154
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,870
is going to be proportional
to exactly this.

155
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,780
And we're saying that the
reaction rate, the forward

156
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,360
reaction rate, is also
proportional to this thing.

157
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,020
So that's where we get the
forward reaction rate.

158
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,000
So the rate forward is equal to
the concentration of our V

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,060
molecules to the a power times
the concentration of our X

160
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,160
molecules to the b power.

161
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,990
Now, if we want to find the
reverse rate, so this is the

162
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,750
rate forward.

163
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:03,580
If we want to find the rate of
the reverse reaction, let's

164
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,840
say that that's equal to some
other constant-- let's call

165
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,440
that K-minus-- the same
exact logic holds.

166
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,140
We're just going in this
direction now.

167
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,250
If we look at our original
one, we're

168
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,150
going in that direction.

169
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,060
So for this reaction, we
do the same thing.

170
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,620
We literally just do different
letters, so the reverse

171
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,890
reaction is just going to be
the concentration of the Y

172
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,700
molecule to the c power, because
we need c of them

173
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,580
there roughly at the same time,
times the concentration

174
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,510
of the Z molecule
to the d power.

175
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,270
Now, just at the beginning of
the video, we said that

176
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,740
equilibrium is when these
rates equal each other.

177
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,750
I wrote it down right here.

178
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,230
So if the reverse rate is equal
to some constant times

179
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,830
this, and the forward rate is
equal to some constant times

180
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,470
that, then we reach equilibrium
when these two are

181
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,490
equal to each other.

182
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,060
Let me clear up some
space here.

183
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,830
   

184
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,320
Let me clear this up, too.

185
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,840
So when are they going to
be equal to each other?

186
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,930
When the forward rate-- the
forward rate is this.

187
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,390
That's our forward constant,
which took into account a

188
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,450
whole bunch of temperature and
molecular structure and all of

189
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,590
that-- times the concentration
of our V

190
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,610
molecule to the a power.

191
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,200
You can kind of view that as
what's the probability of

192
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,490
finding in a certain volume--
and that certain volume can be

193
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,360
factored into that K factor
as well-- but what's the

194
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,960
probability of finding
V things, a V

195
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,250
molecules in some volume.

196
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,330
And it's the concentration
of V to the a power times

197
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,690
concentration of X to the V
power-- that's the forward

198
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,650
reaction-- and that has to equal
the reverse reactions.

199
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,000
So K-minus times the
concentration of Y to the c

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,320
power times the concentration
of Z to the d power.

201
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,050
Now, if we divide both sides
by-- let me erase more space.

202
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,520
Nope, not with that.

203
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,710
All right.

204
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,900
So let's divide both sides by
K-minus and both sides by

205
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:14,790
this, so you get K-plus over
K-minus is equal to that, is

206
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:21,310
equal to Y to the c
times Z to the d.

207
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:28,960
All of that over that-- V to the
a times the concentration

208
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,310
of X to the V.

209
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,690
Let me put this in magenta just
so you know that this was

210
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,090
this K-minus right here.

211
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,580
And then, these are just two
arbitrary constants, so we

212
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,650
could just replace them
and call them

213
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,190
the equilibrium constant.

214
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,840
And we're there where
we need to be.

215
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,590
We're at the formula for the
equilibrium constant.

216
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,240
Now, I know this was really hand
wavy, but I want you to

217
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,620
at least get the sense that this
doesn't come from out of

218
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,900
the blue, and there is-- at
least I think there is--

219
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,020
there's an intuition here.

220
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,510
These are really calculating the
probabilities of finding--

221
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,120
this is the forward reaction
rate probabilities

222
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,580
proportional to this.

223
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,640
Because the more V concentration
you have, the

224
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,390
more likely you're
able to find it.

225
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,360
Although if you need more of
those particles around, you're

226
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,990
going to have to multiply that
concentration by each other,

227
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,070
because the probability's
going to get lower.

228
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,060
Because you need more of them
together in order for the

229
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,880
reaction to happen.

230
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,590
Same thing for everything
there.

231
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,460
But all this is derived from is
that the forward reaction

232
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,770
should be equal to
some constant

233
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,900
times the reverse reaction.

234
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,890
Or actually, their rates should
be equal, but then when

235
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,530
you actually calculate the
probability, you'll have a

236
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,550
constant in there.

237
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,630
Anyway, hopefully, I didn't
confuse you, but I just wanted

238
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,520
to give you that this isn't
just some random equation.

239
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,360
It really does, I think, come
from the reality that the

240
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,510
higher the concentration you
have, the more the probability

241
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,050
you have of the actual
molecules

242
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,100
bumping into each other.
