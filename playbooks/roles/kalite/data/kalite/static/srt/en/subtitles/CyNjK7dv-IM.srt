[intro: theme music]

2
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:05,697
>>DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: We're in the Musée du Louvre

3
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,459
and we're looking at Eugene Delacroix's

4
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:08,891
'Massacre at Chios'.

5
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:12,891
This is a painting that he showed in the Salon in 1824.

6
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:16,172
And it's probably worth remembering that when we say Salon

7
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:20,291
we're talking actually about the Salon Carré, a room in this building.

8
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,246
So this painting is a contemporary political event that shows the aftermath

9
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:27,374
of a battle during the Greek war of independence against the Turkish Empire.

10
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:31,465
And the French would have been very staunchly on the side of the Greeks

11
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,537
for a couple of reasons.

12
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:36,111
First of all, France itself had gone through a series of revolutionary...

13
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:39,334
I almost want to call them quakes: the primary French Revolution,

14
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:42,975
and then of course all of the events that had taken place afterwards

15
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:45,782
with Napoleon condemning the corruption of the monarchy.

16
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:49,949
And so, the Greeks are seen very much as starting up

17
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:54,177
against the corruption of the Empire of the Turks.

18
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:56,942
>>DR. BETH HARRIS: So, those who were sympathetic to the revolution in France

19
00:00:56,942 --> 00:01:00,173
would have been sympathetic to the revolutionaries in Greece.

20
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:02,543
>>ZUCKER: That's right and there's another issue as well,

21
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:04,482
which is the Greeks tended to be Christian

22
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:08,458
and their rulers, the Turks, would have tended to be Muslim.

23
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,663
And so, there's that issue as well.

24
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:15,049
>>HARRIS: What Delacroix does is show us unrelenting misery.

25
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,068
We have a freeze of figures very much in the foreground

26
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:21,981
who are the survivors of this Battle at Chios

27
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:27,131
who are about to be taken into slavery, those that still are alive

28
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:30,348
there are figures who are wounded, there are figures who are dead and dying

29
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:35,981
so the focus is really on these individual moments of suffering within the painting.

30
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,867
So, unlike Géricault's 'Raft of the Medusa'

31
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:42,375
where we have all the figures joined together in this heroic attempt

32
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,276
to flag down the ship in the distance,

33
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:48,748
with Delacroix we focus on each figure and their misery.

34
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:52,449
>>ZUCKER: This really is a painting though that is similar to the Géricault

35
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:54,809
in that it is a painting about emotion.

36
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:57,823
>>HARRIS: And there's a real sense of human suffering

37
00:01:57,823 --> 00:02:00,637
with a lack of heroism at the end.

38
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,774
With David and 'The Oath of the Horatii'

39
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:06,702
those figures are going off to battle, but they do so for a principle.

40
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:10,108
And I guess the figures who have fought here have done that too.

41
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:15,103
But what we get in the end is suffering and slavery.

42
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:16,249
>>ZUCKER: And a sense of exhaustion.

43
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:20,469
>>HARRIS: And in the David we get a space that's very organized.

44
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,214
We get a venire perspective; we get an emphasis on line.

45
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:28,731
And here with Delacroix, we get the importance of color.

46
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,587
We have brushwork that seems more open.

47
00:02:31,587 --> 00:02:34,233
More of an interest in emotion.

48
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:40,131
One of my favorite passages is the horse that rears up that the Turk is riding.

49
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:42,589
What's wonderful is that there's a Greek figure

50
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:45,049
who seems to be pleading with the Turk on the horse

51
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,994
who turns callously away and rears his horse up and back.

52
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:54,081
And I think that sense of the indifference of those in power,

53
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:58,577
the indifference of the oppressor toward the suffering of the oppressed

54
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:02,221
is something that probably really would have had resonance in France

55
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:04,784
during this period of the restoration of the monarchy.

56
00:03:04,784 --> 99:59:59,999
