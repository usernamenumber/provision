[intro: theme music]

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:05,520
>>DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: We're in the Musée du Louvre

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,353
and we're looking at Delacroix's 'Liberty Leading the People'.

4
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:10,655
This is one of the most historically important

5
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:12,115
paintings in this collection.

6
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:13,309
>>DR. BETH HARRIS: And it's important to remember

7
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:16,298
I think, how radical this painting was.

8
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:20,943
It's republican revolutionary politics were palpable.

9
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:23,416
A little bit, perhaps, lost to us, I think, today.

10
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,977
The painting shows the revolution of 1830

11
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:27,817
on the streets of Paris.

12
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:29,059
And what we see is a barricade,

13
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,968
which was a makeshift blockade.

14
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,495
>>ZUCKER: And remember that Paris at this time

15
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:34,902
was really a medieval city.

16
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,545
And so the streets were narrow,

17
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:37,712
and they were winding,

18
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:39,712
and it was easy to block off French troops.

19
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,598
And they were made of furniture.

20
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:42,915
They were made of wagons.

21
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:44,608
They were made especially of cobblestones.

22
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:46,187
And you can see the cobblestones

23
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:47,515
down in the very foreground.

24
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:49,116
>>HARRIS: Over those cobblestones

25
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:51,501
strides a figure who one would not have

26
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:53,838
actually seen on the streets of Paris.

27
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:56,003
So we know this mixture of the real and the unreal,

28
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:59,608
because we have this allegorical figure of Liberty herself,

29
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:03,282
carrying the French tricolor flag which represents

30
00:01:03,282 --> 00:01:06,179
equality, fraternity, and liberty—

31
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:07,902
the values of the revolution.

32
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:08,787
>>ZUCKER: So in the United States,

33
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:11,600
we would recognize this figure as the Statue of Liberty,

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,575
not a specific individual, but in fact

35
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:16,379
the embodiment or personification of an idea,

36
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:17,355
the idea of freedom.

37
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:18,740
>>HARRIS: So it's important to remember here

38
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,500
that what's happened is a monarchy

39
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,668
had been restored in France that was

40
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:24,215
very politically oppressive.

41
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:28,181
And the revolution in July of 1830 was against

42
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:30,522
that restored King Charles the Tenth

43
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:34,441
and brought into power a constitutional monarchy.

44
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:37,034
Presumably, a king that would be more friendly

45
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:39,136
to the needs of the middle class.

46
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:40,838
>>ZUCKER: So there were three days of...

47
00:01:40,838 --> 00:01:43,232
beyond protest, of open warfare

48
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:44,365
in the streets of Paris.

49
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:46,230
Charles the Tenth actually flees France.

50
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,403
And his cousin Louis Philippe is put on the throne.

51
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:52,001
And Delacroix is watching this from his window.

52
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,640
>>HARRIS: And the violence is really frightening.

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,990
We have in the foreground dead members

54
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,932
of both sides of this fight.

55
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:01,724
>>ZUCKER: The figure on the left is really brutal.

56
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:04,330
If you look closely, it's clear that he's in his night shirt.

57
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,118
And one of the practices of the repressive

58
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:08,832
government was to go after the opposition

59
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:11,014
in their homes, beat them to death,

60
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,928
and drag them into the streets as a reminder: "Do not do this."

61
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:16,850
There's a very famous Daumier: 'Rue Transnonain'

62
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,652
that shows a family that has been killed

63
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:19,644
in their bedroom.

64
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:20,698
>>HARRIS: And on the right,

65
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:23,807
a member of the other side of the king's forces.

66
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:26,595
Who's dead or wounded in the foreground.

67
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:27,649
>>ZUCKER: And that's important because

68
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,151
I think that's a reminder that

69
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:31,878
even the royal troops are not invincible.

70
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:33,736
>>HARRIS: Liberty strides forward.

71
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,399
She's incredibly powerful.

72
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:38,585
And importantly, Delacroix is giving her

73
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:39,991
kind of realism.

74
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,283
That was very important, I think, in terms

75
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:44,197
of this message.

76
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,780
I think if the figure had been

77
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,185
an ancient Greek looking figure,

78
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:51,542
we would have lost some of the strength of this image.

79
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:54,906
We see her in profile, starkly lit,

80
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:57,133
with a kind of Caravaggio-esque lighting.

81
00:02:57,133 --> 00:03:01,384
Her arm forward with the flag, her other arm carrying

82
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,932
the bayonet, striding over the barricade.

83
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:08,565
A figure that leads the people on with this idea of liberty.

84
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,920
>>ZUCKER: So, I see exactly what you're saying.

85
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,161
But I also disagree.

86
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:14,370
Because I think that Delacroix isn't viewing

87
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,909
this figure with all of those very human attributes

88
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:17,853
that we're talking about.

89
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:20,896
All of that sense of leadership and all of the

90
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:23,085
allegorical power that she represents.

91
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:24,627
But at the same time, I think Delacroix

92
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:28,172
is actually very consciously drawing on the ancient tradition.

93
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:30,949
The perfect profile, which is the most noble way

94
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:33,048
of representing the face according to the classical world

95
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:35,668
remind us of Roman coinage, for instance.

96
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:38,165
>>HARRIS: So it's not as if Delacroix looked out

97
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:39,713
of his window and actually saw this.

98
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:40,929
And that's not just because of

99
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,621
the allegorical figure of Liberty.

100
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:46,228
The figures are carefully composed in the shape of a pyramid.

101
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:48,551
And Delacroix has also included very different

102
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,527
types of figures intentionally.

103
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:53,451
Showing the range of people who participated

104
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,294
in the revolution of 1830.

105
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:57,314
>>ZUCKER: So not only do you have the man wearing the top hat,

106
00:03:57,314 --> 00:03:59,163
a member of the bourgeoisie, of the middle class,

107
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:02,125
but next to him is a craftsmen—a workman—

108
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,665
in his shirt sleeves,

109
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:06,057
who probably can't afford that nice rifle.

110
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:09,196
But they are together opposing the monarchy.

111
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:10,374
>>HARRIS: And so there was a real

112
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:13,536
political message here of the power of the people

113
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:16,118
to overthrow a government.

114
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:18,379
And the government of Louis Philippe that came

115
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,074
into power purchased this painting,

116
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:23,606
but later this message started to feel

117
00:04:23,606 --> 00:04:25,414
a little bit uncomfortable.

118
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:26,373
>>ZUCKER: A little too radical.

119
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:28,879
>>HARRIS: A little too radical. In fact, the government of Louis Philippe,

120
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,354
although a constitutional monarchy, still only a very small fraction

121
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:35,417
of the French people were able to vote.

122
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:37,595
We're talking about a government that was still

123
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:40,514
favorable only to the interests of real elite.

124
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:44,508
And so the power of the people that we see here in this painting

125
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:47,326
became dangerous, and the painting was taken down

126
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:50,246
and not exhibited again until the revolution of 1848.

127
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:53,326
>>ZUCKER: We'll look, for instance, at the extreme right side of the canvas

128
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,172
and you can make out the two towers of Notre Dame

129
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,325
rising above the smoke of battle.

130
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:00,502
And if you look very closely you can see the tricolor

131
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:02,840
on that symbol of the monarchy.

132
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,306
And so this was such a radical image.

133
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,983
>>HARRIS: Liberty is moving directly into our space

134
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:11,635
leading the people forward.

135
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:13,711
You can see why this painting ended up going

136
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,336
essentially into storage.

137
00:05:15,336 --> 99:59:59,999
