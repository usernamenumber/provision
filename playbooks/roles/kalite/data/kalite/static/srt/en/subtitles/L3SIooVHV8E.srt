1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,593
I love Greek sculpture, I love the archaic

2
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:12,794
I love the classical and all it's restraint and harmony, but I have

3
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:16,649
to tell you I really love the Helenistic -- and the reason I do is because

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,085
two fragments from a great freeze from Pergamon.

5
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:23,150
One has Athena at it's center and one has Zeus.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,051
And I can see why you love these sculptures. They combine

7
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:33,321
what is most wonderful about ancient Greek scupture in the love of the body, but also

8
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:38,522
the sense of expressiveness and drama which we associate so much with the Helenistic.

9
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:43,259
The Helenistic refers to the last period of Greek art, the last phase of Greek art.

10
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:45,070
After the death of Alexandra the Great;

11
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,367
now Alexandra whose father had been a king in Northern Greece

12
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:51,757
in Masadonia had been able to conquer all of Greece,

13
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:54,869
and ultimately conquer an enormous territory

14
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,423
well beyond Greece's original borders.

15
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:00,070
And in so doing, he expanded

16
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,853
the influence the Greek culture across a much wider area.

17
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:11,634
That's right, he in a sense helped Helenize this area, or made it Greek. His expanded territory reached from

18
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:15,442
the ancient civilization of Egypt all the way to the border

19
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,946
between Persia and India to the Indus Valley itself. It was an enormous territory

20
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:25,101
but after he died his empire was divided among his four generals,

21
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:27,609
and one of those generals saw

22
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:30,767
a hilltop near the coast of Turkey which he believe was an important

23
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:31,267
defensive position and there founded the garrison of Pergamon that became

24
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:33,979
ultimately the kingdom of Pergamon.

25
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:38,233
And those are the people who built this fabulous alter and sculpted

26
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:43,005
this fabulous freeze. So what's going on here is a battle

27
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:47,088
between the giants and the gods and godesses

28
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,627
of mount Olympus. We're witnessing a celestial battle

29
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:53,403
of enormous porportions.

30
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:56,656
This is the great mythic battle where the giants battled the olympian

31
00:01:56,656 --> 00:02:00,308
gods for supremecy of the earth and universe. So lets take a close look

32
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:03,766
at it. Let's start with the fragment that has Athena at it's center

33
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:08,235
She is graceful and beautiful even as she battles

34
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:09,865
a ferocious giant, a Titan.

35
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:14,506
It's clear who's gonna win. Athena looks totally in control.

36
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:16,360
She's grabbed Alcyoneus by the hair

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,622
pulling him out of the earth

38
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:22,635
disempowering him. His mother on the other side,

39
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:27,844
completely unable to help him, although she's wild with fear over

40
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:29,841
about what's about to happen to her son.

41
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:33,851
Look at the way the artist, whoever it is, has actually constructed this image.

42
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:39,259
My eye starts with Athena herself, where her head would have been.

43
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,516
My eye rides down that beautiful arm until it's grasped

44
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:46,376
almost tenderly by Alcyoneus. It continues around his elbow

45
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:49,803
and then across his face and down his chest. I notice that one of

46
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:54,547
Athena's snakes is biting him on his right side.

47
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:58,445
My eye then sweeps down that gorgeous curve that is his body,

48
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:03,711
his torso that leads into his leg, but is slowed down by almost

49
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:07,304
the staccato of the intersection of the deeply carved drape

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,739
that belongs to Athena. And of course,

51
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,214
that leads us right back to Alcyoneus' mother.

52
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:24,178
So it's as though Athena, this powerful, in control goddess, is bracketed on either side by these passionate, wild figures that are being defeated

53
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:27,970
and at the same time Athena is being crowned

54
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,431
by a winged nike who comes from behind with a crown for her head.

55
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:37,214
So there's really a sense hear of figures coming from behind,

56
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,662
of figures coming from below, of something that's completely influx, of something that's

57
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:46,161
completely in motion with an incredible sense of drama.

58
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:50,677
It's as if the entire surface of this marble is swirling in a kind of

59
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:55,599
counter clockwise motion around Athena's shield which is at it's very center.

60
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,915
It is full of diagonals which activates the surface.

61
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:02,104
It is full of the deepest carving that creates this

62
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:04,690
brilliant contrast between the highlights of the exposed bodies

63
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,963
and the dark shadows behind them.

64
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:09,225
But, what's also amazing to me is

65
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:13,374
the complexity of the compositions of their bodies. Athena who

66
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:17,742
moves toward the left, keeps her arm to the right

67
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:22,077
and then Alcyoneous lifts his head up, twists his shoulders

68
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:24,076
his legs still back behind him,

69
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:29,560
and we're really talking about virtuoso sculpting here of the human body.

70
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:33,296
Imagine what this would have looked like when it was painted.

71
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:37,016
You know, we think so often about Greek sculpture as being just this

72
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:39,116
brilliant white marble. But we have to remember

73
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:42,629
that all of this was brilliantly painted. Let's take a look at

74
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,581
the fragment with Zeus at its center.

75
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:48,250
Like Athena, he seems composed and totally in

76
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,105
control, even as he rushes forward. We have no doubt

77
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,716
that he's the victor here.

78
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:56,257
So Zeus is an enormously powerful figure.

79
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:59,285
We have this beautifully exposed chest and abdomen

80
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:02,280
and this wild, almost living drapery that seems to whip around

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,387
his legs, and he is taking on not one, but three giants at the same moment.

82
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:11,701
But luckily he's the king of the gods and he's got things like

83
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:14,089
eagles and thunderbolts to help him out.

84
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,906
That's right, if you look at the upper right

85
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:19,217
you can see that an eagle, Zeus' emblem, is taking on

86
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:24,072
the elder titan. As the eagle is preoccupying that giant,

87
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:28,115
Zeus is able to turn his attention to the giant at his feet

88
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:31,105
who's on his knees and is shortly going to be vanquished. You can see

89
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:35,056
that on Zeus' other side he has just finished putting a way a giant

90
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,460
who almost seems to be sitting on a rock. He's gotten stuck

91
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,666
in his theigh, what looks like a torch but is actually the way

92
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:45,588
the Greeks represented Zeus' thunderbolts.

93
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:46,459
Ouch, that has to hurt...

94
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:53,227
(laughter) It does, there's a sense of heroism, a sense of balance, even as there

95
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:55,281
is the sense of the momentary and a kind of excitement

96
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:59,858
that really pulls us in. You know, the story of the gods and the giants

97
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,374
is a story that was really important to the Greeks.

98
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,426
It was really a set of symbols that spoke of the Greek's fear

99
00:06:06,426 --> 00:06:09,601
but also optimism that they could overcome chaos.

100
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:15,325
So this battle, it's really a metaphore for the victory of Greek culture

101
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:19,757
over the unknown, over the chaotic forces of nature.

102
00:06:19,757 --> 00:06:23,083
Right, and also represents the military victories over other

103
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,183
cultures that they didn't understand and also feared.

104
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:30,747
So let's walk up the stairs of the great alter, into the most sacred part

105
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:35,041
of the great alter where the fire, presumeably to Zeus, would have been lit

106
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:35,662
and the sacrifices might have been offered.

107
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:39,880
You had mentioned earlier that the figures seemed to almost spill out

108
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,226
away from the wall, and I think that's most clearly seen as we walk up the stairs.

109
00:06:43,257 --> 00:06:46,158
There are moments when the figures that are carved in this high relief

110
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:50,815
actually rest their knee on the stairs,

111
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,957
actually literally enter our space. For instance, one of the sea nymphs

112
00:06:54,495 --> 00:07:00,057
whose legs actually end in the tail of a great serpant, coils her tail

113
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:03,480
on one of the stairs. There is this wonderful way in which they

114
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,083
literally pour out into our world.

115
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,921
And so this whole drama is unfolding

116
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:15,611
around us, moving into our space, and it, it must have been an amazing fitting to have seen --

117
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:18,966
One of the questions that comes to mind is why are these sculptures here

118
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:22,020
in Berlin, and the answer can be found in

119
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,074
the political ambitions of Prussia at the time.

120
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:30,728
They were very much wanting to be rhe equal of the French and the British, and that meant in part to have great

121
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,944
museums that express the civilizations of the past

122
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:37,988
so they could be in a sense the inheriters of the great classical tradition

123
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:40,175
which was so revered in the 19th century.

124
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:40,810
You know, Berlin in someways wanted to be the new Rome.

125
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:46,463
And so one of the great thing about being in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin

126
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:49,578
is that instead of just putting what remains of the freezes on the wall

127
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:56,172
they've reconstructed the alter and as much of the freeze as possible

128
00:07:56,172 --> 00:08:00,237
and so we really get a sense of what this was like

129
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:04,091
in the city of Pergamon in the 3rd century B.C.

130
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:05,391
Right, and so this was the 3rd century.

131
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:09,082
We would be on the Acropolis, this hilltop, in the city of Pergamon

132
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:12,786
about 20 miles from the coast in what is now Turkey.

133
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:18,157
We would walk up this hill, and we would find the alter of Zeus

134
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:22,085
surrounded by a great library that is reported to have had 200,000

135
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:26,265
scrolls. A garrison for soldiers, a royal palace for the king.

136
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:34,688
And so this whole drama is unfolding around us, moving into our space

137
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,143
and it must have been an amazing thing to have seen in the 2nd century B.C.
