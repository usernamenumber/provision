1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,780
7 patients blood pressures
have been measured after

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,580
having been given a new
drug for 3 months.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,960
They had blood pressure
increases of, and they give us

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,010
seven data points right here--
who knows, that's in some

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,330
blood pressure units.

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,440
Construct a 95% confidence
interval for the true expected

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,510
blood pressure increase for all
patients in a population.

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,740
So there's some population
distribution here.

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,930
It's a reasonable assumption
to think that it is normal.

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,990
It's a biological process.

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,560
So if you gave this drug to
every person who has ever

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,630
lived, that will result in some
mean increase in blood

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,730
pressure, or who knows, maybe
it actually will decrease.

15
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,970
And there's also going to be
some standard deviation here.

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,730
   

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,400
It is a normal distribution.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,850
And the reason why it's
reasonable to assume that it's

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,580
a normal distribution
is because it's

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,580
a biological process.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,370
It's going to be the sum of many
thousands and millions of

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,440
random events.

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,370
And things that are sums of
millions and thousands of

24
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,000
random events tend to be
normal distribution.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,420
So this is a population
distribution.

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,270
   

27
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,410
And we don't know anything
really about it outside of the

28
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,180
sample that we have here.

29
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,980
Now, what we can do is, and this
tends to be a good thing

30
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,090
to do, when you do have a
sample just figure out

31
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,980
everything that you can
figure out about that

32
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,070
sample from the get-go.

33
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,490
So we have our seven
data points.

34
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,010
And you could add them up and
divide by 7 and get your

35
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,150
sample mean.

36
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,950
So our sample mean
here is 2.34.

37
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,410
And then you can also
calculate your

38
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,980
sample standard deviation.

39
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,380
Find the square distance from
each of these points to your

40
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,460
sample mean, add them up, divide
by n minus 1, because

41
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,810
it's a sample, then take the
square root, and you get your

42
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,180
sample standard deviation.

43
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,720
I did this ahead of time
just to save time.

44
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,750
Sample standard deviation
is 1.04.

45
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,930
And when you don't know anything
about the population

46
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,280
distribution, the thing that
we've been doing from the

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,210
get-go is estimating that
character with our sample

48
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,790
standard deviation.

49
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,100
So we've been estimating the
true standard deviation of the

50
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,193
population with our sample
standard deviation.

51
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:16,030
   

52
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,340
Now in this problem, this exact
problem, we're going to

53
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,220
run into a problem.

54
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,940
We're estimating our standard
deviation with an n of only 7.

55
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:31,410
So this is probably going to
be a not so good estimate

56
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:40,780
because-- let me just write--
because n is small.

57
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,140
In general, this is considered
a bad estimate if n

58
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,800
is less than 30.

59
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,830
Above 30 you're dealing
in the realm

60
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,880
of pretty good estimates.

61
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,720
So the whole focus of this video
is when we think about

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,300
the sampling distribution, which
is what we're going to

63
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,970
use to generate our interval,
instead of assuming that the

64
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,490
sampling distribution is normal
like we did in many

65
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,180
other videos using the central
limit theorem and all of that,

66
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,290
we're going to tweak the
sampling distribution.

67
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,570
We're not going to assume it's
a normal distribution because

68
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,060
this is a bad estimate.

69
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,300
We're going to assume that
it's something called a

70
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,850
t-distribution.

71
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,270
And a t-distribution is
essentially, the best way to

72
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,820
think about is it's almost
engineered so it gives a

73
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,340
better estimate of your
confidence intervals and all

74
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,170
of that when you do have
a small sample size.

75
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,165
It looks very similar to
a normal distribution.

76
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:34,640
   

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,600
It has some mean, so this is
your mean of your sampling

78
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,780
distribution still.

79
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,055
But it also has fatter tails.

80
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:46,310
   

81
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,990
And the way I think about why
it has fatter tails is when

82
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,960
you make an assumption that this
is a standard deviation

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,840
for-- let me take
one more step.

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,090
So normally what we do is we
find the estimate of the true

85
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,560
standard deviation, and then
we say that the standard

86
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,950
deviation of the sampling
distribution is equal to the

87
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,360
true standard deviation of our
population divided by the

88
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,130
square root of n.

89
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,640
In this case, n is equal to 7.

90
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,410
And then we say OK, we never
know the true standard, or we

91
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,660
seldom know-- sometimes you do
know-- we seldom know the true

92
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,400
standard deviation.

93
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,310
So if we don't know that the
best thing we can put in there

94
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,870
is our sample standard
deviation.

95
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,980
   

96
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,000
And this right here, this is the
whole reason why we don't

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,070
say that this is just a 95
probability interval.

98
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,560
This is the whole reason why
we call it a confidence

99
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,040
interval because we're making
some assumptions.

100
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,690
This thing is going to change
from sample to sample.

101
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,860
And in particular, this is going
to be a particularly bad

102
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,380
estimate when we have a
small sample size, a

103
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,450
size less than 30.

104
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,810
So when you are estimating the
standard deviation where you

105
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,920
don't know it, you're estimating
it with your sample

106
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,320
standard deviation, and your
sample size is small, and

107
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,490
you're going to use this to
estimate the standard

108
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,940
deviation of your sampling
distribution, you don't assume

109
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,795
your sampling distribution
is a normal distribution.

110
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:17,350
You assume it has
fatter tails.

111
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,540
And it has fatter tails because
you're essentially

112
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,360
underestimating-- you're
underestimating the standard

113
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,730
deviation over here.

114
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,230
Anyway, with all of that said,
let's just actually go through

115
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,150
this problem.

116
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,180
So we need to think about a 95%
confidence interval around

117
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,450
this mean right over here.

118
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,580
So a 95% confidence interval,
if this was a normal

119
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,200
distribution you would just
look it up in a Z-table.

120
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,450
But it's not, this is
a t-distribution.

121
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,310
   

122
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,990
We're looking for a 95%
confidence interval.

123
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,030
So some interval around
the mean that

124
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,540
encapsulates 95% of the area.

125
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,650
For a t-distribution you use
t-table, and I have a t-table

126
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,380
ahead of time right over here.

127
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,270
And what you want to do is use
the two-sided row for what

128
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,390
we're doing right over here.

129
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,720
And the best way to think
about it is that we're

130
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,860
symmetric around the mean.

131
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,190
And that's why they
call it two-sided.

132
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,310
It would be one-sided if it
was kind of a cumulative

133
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,990
percentage up to some
critical threshold.

134
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,600
But in this case, it's
two-sided, we're symmetric.

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,970
Or another way to think
about it is we're

136
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,200
excluding the two sides.

137
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,490
So we want the 95%
in the middle.

138
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:33,370
And this is a sampling
distribution of the sample

139
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,780
mean for n is equal to 7.

140
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,210
And I won't go into the details
here, but when n is

141
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:45,330
equal to 7 you have 6 degrees
of freedom, or n minus 1.

142
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,110
And the way that t-tables are
set up, you go and find the

143
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,030
degrees of freedom.

144
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,710
So you don't go to the n,
you go to the n minus 1.

145
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,560
So you go to the 6 right here.

146
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,650
So if you want to encapsulate
95% of this right over here,

147
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:04,090
and you have an n of 6, you
have to go 2.447 standard

148
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,060
deviations in each direction.

149
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,520
And this t-table assumes that
you are approximating that

150
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,980
standard deviation using your
sample standard deviation.

151
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,680
So another way to think of it
you have to go 2.447 of these

152
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,850
approximated standard
deviations.

153
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,880
Let me it right here.

154
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:28,380
So you have to go 2.447-- this
distance right here is 2.447

155
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,455
times this approximated
standard deviation.

156
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,700
   

157
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,060
And sometimes you'll see this
in some statistics book.

158
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,330
This thing right here,
this exact number,

159
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,580
is shown like this.

160
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,570
They put a little hat on top of
the standard deviation to

161
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,140
show that it has been
approximated using the sample

162
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,040
standard deviation.

163
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,380
So we'll put a little hat over
here, because frankly, this is

164
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,770
the only thing that
we can calculate.

165
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,680
So this is how far you have
to go in each direction.

166
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,880
And we know what
this value is.

167
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,960
We know what the sample
distribution is.

168
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,400
So let's get our
calculator out.

169
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:10,850
   

170
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:17,040
So we know our sample standard
deviation is 1.04.

171
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,120
And we want to divide that
by the square root of 7.

172
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,550
   

173
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,010
So we get 0.39.

174
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:36,140
So this right here is 0.39.

175
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,720
And so if we want to find
the distance around this

176
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,820
population mean that
encapsulates 95% of the

177
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,070
population or of the sampling
distribution, we have to

178
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,330
multiply 0.39 times 2.447,
so let's do that.

179
00:08:51,330 --> 00:09:01,130
So times 2.447 is
equal to 0.96.

180
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:10,090
So this is equal to-- so this
distance right here is 0.96,

181
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,810
and then this distance
right here is 0.96.

182
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,290
So if you take a random sample,
and that's exactly

183
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,690
what we did when we found
these 7 samples.

184
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,880
When we took these 7 samples and
took their mean, that mean

185
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,680
can be viewed as a random
sample from the sampling

186
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,780
distribution.

187
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,560
And so the probability, and so
we can view it, we could say

188
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,440
that there's a 95% chance-- and
we have to actually caveat

189
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,340
everything with a confident,
because we're doing all of

190
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,010
these estimations here.

191
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,720
So it's not a true precise
95% chance.

192
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,870
We're just confident that
there's a 95% chance that our

193
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,840
random population, our random
sampling mean right here, so

194
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,870
that 2.34, which we can kind of
use-- we just picked that

195
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,790
2.34 from this distribution
right here.

196
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:12,160
So there's a 95% chance that
2.34 is within 0.96 of the

197
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,940
true sampling distribution mean,
which we know is also

198
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,370
the same thing as the
population mean.

199
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,820
   

200
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,360
Or we can just rearrange the
sentence and say that there is

201
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:33,400
a 95% chance that the mean, the
true mean, which is the

202
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,770
same thing as a sampling
distribution mean, is within

203
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:45,420
0.96 of our sample
mean, of 2.34.

204
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:52,460
So at the low end, so if you go
2.36 minus-- if you go 2.34

205
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,100
minus 0.96-- that's the low
end of our confidence

206
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,590
interval, 1.38.

207
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,830
And the high end of our
confidence interval, 2.34 plus

208
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,260
0.96 is equal to 3.3.

209
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,610
So our 95% confidence interval
is from 1.38 to 3.3.

210
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:10,867
