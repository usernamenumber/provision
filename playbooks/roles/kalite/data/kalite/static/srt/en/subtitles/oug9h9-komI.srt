1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,010
We're on problem 198.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:16,460
If 1/2 plus 1/3, plus 1/4 is equal to 13/x,

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,860
which of the following must be an integer?

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,040
Fascinating.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,780
So let's see what they're saying.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,690
I don't know. I'm tempted to just work through this.

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,940
So if I get a common denominator here,

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,620
the common denominator is going to be 12.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,530
1/2 is 6/12 plus 4/12, plus 3/12.

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,040
6 plus 4, plus 3, is 13. So, that equals 13/12.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,000
So that tell us that x is equal to 13.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,660
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,090
That tells us that x is equal to 12.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,240
It's the denominator.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,450
OK, so they give us a couple of choices.

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,010
Choice one, x/8.

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,050
Is that an integer?

18
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,010
No, 12 divided by 8 is not an integer.

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,030
It's 1 and 1/2.

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,000
Choice two, x divided by 12.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,010
Is that an integer?

22
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,990
Yeah, sure.

23
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,620
I mean 12 divided by 12 is equal to 1.

24
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,620
So, that works.

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,300
Choice three, x divided by 24.

26
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,770
No, x is 12.

27
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,720
So, x divided by 24 is 1/2.

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,060
So, two only is the answer, and that is choice B.

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,540
Problem 199.

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,050
And they have drawn a graph, which I will draw.

31
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,610
So that's a y-axis.

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,020
And there's an x-axis.

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,070
And that's y.

34
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,850
That is x.

35
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,880
See, in the rectangular coordinate system above, the line,

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,100
y equals x is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB,

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,670
not shown.

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,080
OK, so let me draw this y equals x graph.

39
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,040
Start there.

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:51,860
Nope.

41
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,080
I thought I was using the line tool, but I'm not.

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,090
Let me use the line tool.

43
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,000
That's the y equals x graph.

44
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,980
y is equal to x.

45
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,410
And they draw point A.

46
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,150
The place they drew it,

47
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,640
it looks like it's roughly at the point 2, 3.

48
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,050
I don't know if that's going to become relevant.

49
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,050
2, 1, 2, 3.

50
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,080
So A looks like it's at the point 2,3.

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
I don't know if we can assume that.

52
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,430
The line, y equals x, is a perpendicular bisector of AB,

53
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,250
and they don't show us B.

54
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,010
And the x-axis is the perpendicular bisector of BC.

55
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,840
All right. Not shown.

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,130
If the coordinates of point A are 2 comma 3--

57
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,350
OK, we were right; A is 2 comma 3--

58
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,030
what are the coordinates of point C?

59
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,900
OK, perpendicular bisector means there's some line

60
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,210
that's exactly perpendicular to this line,

61
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,940
where it splits it in half. Right?

62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,560
So if you think about it, point A is at 2, 3.

63
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,250
So where would B have to be in order for the line between A

64
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,160
and B to be perpendicular to this line,

65
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,050
and to be split directly in half?

66
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,110
Well, it would be at the point--

67
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,280
I mean, you could just eyeball it--

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,100
it'd be at the point 3 comma 2.

69
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,200
If we're at the point 3 comma 2, there's a lot of, I guess,

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,730
intuitive reasons why you could think that

71
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,860
this would be the perpendicular bisector.

72
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,010
We know y equals x is a perpendicular bisector.

73
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,010
The first is, you can see that the slope of this line--

74
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,190
you could calculate it if you want--

75
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,030
the slope of this line is negative 1.

76
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,120
And I don't know if you remember in calculus class,

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,550
but if you have the slope of one line--

78
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,380
so the slope of this line is 1--

79
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,850
the slope of a perpendicular line

80
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,500
will be the negative inverse of this slope.

81
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,620
That's something that, hopefully, you learned in calculus--

82
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,440
oh, in algebra a long time ago.

83
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,250
So, the negative inverse of 1 is negative 1.

84
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,440
So this line has a slope of negative 1.

85
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,250
And you could make a bunch of arguments

86
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,060
for why it's equidistant.

87
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,690
Both of these points are on the same line,

88
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,040
and they're equidistant from the point 2 comma 2.

89
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,800
So that's why, you know, that it's the bisector,

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,710
that this distance is equal to this distance.

91
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,790
And, frankly, on the GMAT, you're doing it fast.

92
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,580
You don't have to do a rigorous proof.

93
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,320
You can eyeball it.

94
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,770
You could say, oh, you know, those are going to be equal.

95
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,960
I'm just going to take the mirror image

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,810
and go on the other side.

97
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,000
So this is point B.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,300
And they tell us that the x-axis is a perpendicular

99
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,590
bisector of segment BC.

100
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:27,400
OK, so x is going to be perpendicular to this new line.

101
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,550
So this new line has to be parallel to the y-axis.

102
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,010
So this new line is going to go like that.

103
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,930
And whatever the distance is between B and the x-axis

104
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,080
has to be the distance between x-axis and C.

105
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,900
So B is two above the x-axis,

106
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,250
so C is going to be two below the x-axis.

107
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,030
So that's where C is.

108
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,460
And x, at that point, is equal to 3.

109
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,090
And so this y would be equal to negative 2.

110
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,460
So what are the coordinates of point C?

111
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,390
3, negative 2.

112
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,040
And that is choice D.

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,890
Interesting problem.

114
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:07,010
Problem 200.

115
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,930
A store currently charges the same price

116
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,810
for each towel that it sells.

117
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,050
If the current price of each towel were to increase by $1,

118
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,340
10 fewer of the towels could be bought for $120,

119
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,980
excluding sales tax.

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,050
What is the current price of each towel?

121
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,040
So let's say the current price of each towel.

122
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,540
So if we take 120

123
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,530
and we divide it by the current price of each towel,

124
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,090
we could buy, I don't know, n towels.

125
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,670
Now, they're saying that if we had $120,

126
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,190
and if we were to increase the price by $1--

127
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,820
so now the new price is p plus 1;

128
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,170
now I can't buy n towels anymore--

129
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,570
they're saying I can only buy 10 fewer towels.

130
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,830
So I can only buy n minus 10 towels.

131
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,050
Now we have two equations and two unknowns.

132
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,540
Well, they're not linear equations, but I think we

133
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,010
should be able to solve them one way or the other.

134
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:25,030
So here we get p times n is equal to 120.

135
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,710
And here, let's see, we can multiply--

136
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:34,600
we have 120 is equal to p plus 1, times n minus 10.

137
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:51,050
So that's equal to p times n, minus 10p, plus n, minus 10.

138
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,720
And so both of these are equal to 120,

139
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,600
so we could set them equal to each other. Right?

140
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,010
Both of these are equal to 120.

141
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,080
So we could use both of these equations.

142
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:09,660
Say pn is equal to pn minus 10p, plus n, minus 10.

143
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,080
So let's see if we can make any headway here.

144
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,530
I could subtract pn from both sides.

145
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:26,010
So I get 0 is equal to minus 10p, plus n, minus 10.

146
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,200
And let's see, I could add 10p to both sides,

147
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:38,000
and I get 10p is equal to n minus 10.

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,020
Well, what's n?

149
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,020
Actually, I shouldn't have substituted like this.

150
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,500
I'm kind of doing it a little messily.

151
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,810
But we can do another substitution.

152
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,080
n is equal to 120/p, so that should help us.

153
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,700
The real way I should have done it is--

154
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,990
well, actually, no, this is I think the easiest way to do it.

155
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,010
10p.

156
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,030
n is 120/p.

157
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,780
A lot of times you just have to go forth with the algebra

158
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,810
and see what happens.

159
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,010
Minus 10.

160
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,560
And let's multiply both sides of the equation by p.

161
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,770
So you get 10 is equal--

162
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:17,540
sorry, 10p squared is equal to 120 minus 10p.

163
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,990
Let's divide both sides by 10 just to get rid of them.

164
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,080
So you get p squared is equal to 12, minus p.

165
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,940
Let's take these on to the left-hand side.

166
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,030
So you get p squared plus p, minus 12, is equal to 0.

167
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,910
We have a quadratic.

168
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,800
We can just factor it.

169
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,020
That is p plus 4, times p minus 3 is equal to 0.

170
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,020
What two numbers, when you add them, equal plus 1?

171
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,980
The coefficient there.

172
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,000
When you multiply them they equal negative 12.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,010
That's just practice you got in algebra doing that.

174
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,680
So that's p plus 4, times p, minus 3.

175
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,000
So p could be minus 4, or p could be equal to 3.

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,410
And p can't be might minus 4

177
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,970
unless he was giving away the towels,

178
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,690
he was paying people to take the towels,

179
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,820
which isn't the case.

180
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,980
We're assuming that price is positive.

181
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,550
So the price had to be $3, which, luckily enough,

182
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,920
after doing all that algebra, is one of the choices.

183
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,030
Choice C.

184
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,020
Next question.

185
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,070
201.

186
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,010
I think I have time to do this one.

187
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,450
201.

188
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,750
If the sum of n consecutive integers is 0 --

189
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,370
this is my ad hoc notation--

190
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,590
which of the following must be true?

191
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,980
n consecutive integers is 0.

192
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,920
n must be an even number.

193
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,070
So let's think a lot about, like,

194
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,870
our even and odd type of talk.

195
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,870
So we know that an even plus an even is even.

196
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,030
And we know that an odd plus an odd is also even.

197
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,900
And you could prove it to yourself.

198
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,790
You could try a bunch of numbers.

199
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,130
Or if you just write an odd as 2k plus 1,

200
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,990
and you add it to another 2m plus 1, 2k--

201
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,650
that becomes 2 times k, plus m, plus 2.

202
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,950
So, that's an even number.

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,040
It's divisible by 2.

204
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,360
So an odd plus an odd is even.

205
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,700
And so the only way you're going to get an odd number is

206
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,000
if you have an even plus an odd.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,760
Now, the only way you're going to have an even plus an odd--

208
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,020
so we're summing n consecutive numbers.

209
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,760
So, I don't know, let's call it number 1, plus number 2,

210
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,890
plus number 3.

211
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,620
Let's think about it a couple of different ways.

212
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,730
If this number is odd, then this number is obviously even,

213
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,030
and then this number is odd.

214
00:10:53,530 --> 00:11:00,720
Now, if we're taking the sum of an even number, if n is even,

215
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,430
we're going to get the same number of evens and odds.

216
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,000
So n could be 2.

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,750
If n could be 2, we're going to have one even and one odd

218
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,700
no matter what, right?

219
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,830
This could be odd. This could be even.

220
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,390
Or this could be even and this could be odd.

221
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,660
And if n is 2, which is an even number, we can very easily--

222
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,370
you know an odd plus an even is an odd number.

223
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:31,020
So, they say if the sum of n consecutive integers is 0--

224
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,470
oh, you know what?

225
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,360
I completely missed that point.

226
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,080
Let me continue this in the next video.
