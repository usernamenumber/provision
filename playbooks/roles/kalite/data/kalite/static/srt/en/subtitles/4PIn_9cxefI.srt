1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,520
Problem 10.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,920
John uses 2/3 of a cup of oats per serving to make oatmeal.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,850
How many cups of oats does he need to make 6 servings?

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,670
So he uses 2/3 per serving,and he's going to have 6 servings

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,200
So it's going to be 6 times-- for every serving there's 2/3,

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,670
so it's going to be 6 times that.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,200
So it's going to be 2/3 per serving,

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,600
and we can even put units there.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,260
We could say 1 over servings.

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,410
Well, that just confuses it.

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,300
2/3 per serving times 6 servings.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,500
So that's just 6 times 2/3.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,170
And that is equal to--

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,900
maybe it's easier to visualize in your head

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,230
as multiplying two fractions.

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,950
We can write that as 2/3 times 6/1,

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,880
and that's equal to-- we could simplify it ahead of time.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,150
Or we can just write that as 2 times 6 in the numerator--

19
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,260
which is 12-- and the denominator is 3 times 1--

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:01,980
which is 3.

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,030
Multiplying fractions is far easier

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,030
than adding or subtracting.

23
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,420
Because literally the new numerator of the product

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,130
is just the product of the numerators,

25
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,320
and then the denominator of the product

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,080
is just the product of the denominators.

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,410
2 times 6 is 12.

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,390
3 times 1 is 3.

29
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,470
And 12/3-- that's the same thing as 12 divided by 3--

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,330
that just equals 4.

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,980
Which is choice B right there.

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,300
Another way you could have done it is

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,920
you could have simplified it right here.

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,230
You could have divided the 6 and the 3 both by 3.

35
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,590
So if you had 2/3 times 6/1,

36
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,970
you could divide the 6 by 3 and the 3 by 3.

37
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,100
So you get 1, and then you just get 2 times-- sorry,

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,090
6 divided by 3 is 2.

39
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,780
So you have 2 times 2 is equal to 4, over 1 times 1.

40
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,260
And the whole reason why you could do that

41
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,010
is this thing right here, instead of solving it up here,

42
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:08,320
I could have rewritten it as 2 times 6 over 3 times 1.

43
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,450
And then you could simplify it before getting to this stage.

44
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,550
You could just divide the 6 by the 3,and you get a 1 and a 2

45
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,990
6 divided by 3 is 2, you get 4.

46
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,670
I'm probably beating a dead horse,

47
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,490
but just in case you need a review multiplying fractions,

48
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,370
you just got it.

49
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:34,360
Which expression represents 0.0000007

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,650
in scientific notation?

51
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,100
So the easy way to convert scientific notation,

52
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,070
especially when you have a number

53
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,910
behind the decimal point like this,

54
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,300
is you literally just count the digits

55
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,230
behind the decimal point.

56
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:56,690
And we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 numbers

57
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,360
behind the decimal point.

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,910
So our answer is going to be 7.

59
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:08,140
This 7, right here, 7 times 10 to the--

60
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,870
it's going to be a negative exponent

61
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,260
because we're going less than 1.

62
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,200
We're going behind the decimal point.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,520
10 to the minus-- and I just counted.

64
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

65
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,480
10 to the minus 7.

66
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
Right there.

67
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,430
And if you find this problem a little bit daunting,

68
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,940
I have actually two videos

69
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,400
where I go into depth about scientific notation.

70
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,740
So you might want to watch those,

71
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,780
just in case you run into the opposite situation.

72
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,450
If you had 7,000, and you want to write that

73
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,640
in scientific notation.

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,030
So in this case we're going above,

75
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,410
we're going into the positive domain.

76
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,510
Then, instead of just counting--

77
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,000
when we had a decimal, you counted the actual digits.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
You included the 7, right?

79
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,010
That's where you got 10 to the minus 7.

80
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,350
When you have something like this, you just count the 0's.

81
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:04,170
So 7,000 would be 7 times 10 to the third.

82
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,550
If you want more of the rationale of why that works,

83
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,110
I definitely recommend that you watch the two videos

84
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,150
that I have on scientific notation.

85
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,980
Next problem.

86
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,740
The Venn diagram below shows the number of girls

87
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,180
on the soccer and track team at a high school.

88
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,350
So this is the soccer team, this is the track team.

89
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,550
And right here, this is the girls

90
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,860
who are on both the soccer and the track team.

91
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,680
How many girls are on both the soccer and the track teams?

92
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
So I kind of jumped the gun.

93
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,000
They're telling us the answer right there.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,170
There are 6 girls.

95
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,660
This overlap region-- right?

96
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,130
If some girl is, let's say that some girl right there,

97
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,960
she's in the soccer circle,

98
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,060
and she's also in the track circle.

99
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,810
And this number tells us that there's 6 of these girls.

100
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,590
So there are 6 girls

101
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,870
that are on both the soccer and the track teams.
