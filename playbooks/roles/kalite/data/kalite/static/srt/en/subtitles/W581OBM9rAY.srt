1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,930
So we started doing some
free-throw percentage

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,060
problems in the last
video, so let's continue.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,290
So the first time I said if
I had an 80% free-throw

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,000
percentage, what are my
chances of getting three

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,290
free throws in a row?

7
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,640
And I said, well,
it's 51.2% chance.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,020
Let's do another scenario, and
let's just assume that my

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,080
free-throw percentage
stays at 80%.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:29,050
And let's say that-- I don't
know-- let's say my team

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,320
is two points behind.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,519
I'm making this up on the fly,
so we're two points behind.

13
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:36,960
   

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,360
No, let's say we're
one point behind.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:46,420
   

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,310
And I'm up at the free-throw
line, and I want to say, what

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:57,520
is the chance-- and let's say
I have three free throws.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,440
Someone fouled me when I
was shooting a 3-pointer.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,960
So we're one point behind,
there's one second left, and

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,820
right when I was going to take
the winning free throw-- or

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,680
not the winning free throw.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,500
The winning 3-point
shot, someone fouls me.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,245
So I get three free throws.

24
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:19,950
   

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,110
And once again, I have an
80% free-throw percentage.

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,690
My actual percentage
is probably something

27
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,390
more like 20%.

28
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,660
But anyway, I have
three free throws.

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,980
So my question is, what are
our chances of winning?

30
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,730
What is the probability
of my team winning?

31
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,850
   

32
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,580
Not tying, winning.

33
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,760
So in order to win--
well, actually let's

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,950
do the tying first.

35
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,320
So what's the
probability of tying?

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,870
   

37
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,840
How do you spell-- tying, OK.

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,190
What's the probability
of a tie?

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,740
Well, the probability of a tie
is going to be equal to the

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:17,600
probability of me getting
at least one free throw.

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,870
You might say OK, that's the
probably of getting exactly 1

42
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,940
times the probability of
getting 2 out of 3 plus

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,360
the probability of
getting 3 out of 3.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,280
But like we saw in-- I think it
was either the last video or

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,820
the video before-- that is
identical equal to the

46
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,590
probability or, let's see, 1
minus the probability of not

47
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,080
getting any free throws.

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:49,580
   

49
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,950
The probability of getting at
least one is essentially the

50
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,220
probability of me not
missing all three.

51
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,600
Hopefully that
makes some sense.

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,500
So let me erase all this stuff
that I did up on top, and

53
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,440
we can to figure out the
answer to this problem.

54
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,910
Let me erase all of
this, erase all that.

55
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,630
Erase that.

56
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,180
Let me erase this.

57
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,160
We know I have an 80%
probability of making

58
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,230
any one shot.

59
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,930
So if we go back to the
problem-- so this is my

60
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,740
free throw percentage.

61
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,940
So what is the probability of
me not making any shots, not

62
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,850
making any of my free throws?

63
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,830
Well, my probability of not
making one free throw is 20%.

64
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,920
20% chance of not making any
free throws, or not making

65
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,210
any-- say I take a shot, I have
a 20% of no basket, or not

66
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,290
making the free throw.

67
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,310
So if I'm taking three shots,
the shot of I miss all three

68
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:11,000
is going to be equal to
20% times 20% times 20%.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,420
And that equals what?

70
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:19,550
This 0.2 times 0.2
is 0.04 times 0.2.

71
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,280
   

72
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,530
And then let's see.

73
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,960
What's 0.04 times 0.2?

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,790
Let's see, that'll be an 8
and I have 1, 2, 3 numbers

75
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,620
by the decimal place.

76
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,870
It's 1, 2, 3.

77
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,930
So 0.008.

78
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:42,340
So I have a 0.008 chance of
missing all of the free throws.

79
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,140
Or another way you could view
this is, is this is equal to--

80
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,940
a percentage is just this times
100 so there's 0.8% chance of

81
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,280
missing all of the free throws.

82
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,120
Or another way of viewing this
is I have-- so what's my chance

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,420
of making at least one?

84
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,450
Well, it's going to
be 1 minus this.

85
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,850
So what's 1 minus
0.-- this is a 0.

86
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,370
0.008.

87
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:09,320
Well it's 99.2%.

88
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,470
Yeah, that's 99.2%.

89
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,350
Or you could also
view it as 0.992.

90
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,180
You take 1 minus this, you
get 0.992, which is the

91
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,720
same thing as 99.2% chance.

92
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,620
So I have a 99.2% chance of
at least tying the game.

93
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,230
So it's pretty high if you have
someone at the free-throw line

94
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,535
with a 80% free-throw
percentage and they

95
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:34,300
have three shots.

96
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,560
Now, what if I only
had two shots?

97
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,280
Let's say I got fouled when
I was thinking a 2-pointer

98
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,720
and I only have two shots.

99
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,180
Well, in that case, in order to
tie the game I have to get at

100
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,120
least one, but I only
have two shots.

101
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,830
So it would be 1 minus
the chances of me

102
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,660
missing both shots.

103
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,090
What's the chances of
missing two shots?

104
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, the chance of missing
two shots in a row-- it's 4%.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,430
20% times 20%.

106
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:06,240
It's a 4% chance of missing
two shots, two in a row.

107
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,400
So my probability of getting at
least one, assuming that I am

108
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,300
taking two shots, is going
to be 1 minus this.

109
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:21,410
I have a 96% probability of at
least one shot if I take two.

110
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,950
So that's also pretty high.

111
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,170
And of course, what's
my probability if I

112
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,730
only have one shot?

113
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,560
Well, it's 80%.

114
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,260
So hopefully that gives you a
little bit of framework next

115
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,580
time you watch basketball game
and you can pause your TiVo and

116
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,340
figure out the probability
when the person is making

117
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,470
that last clutch shot.

118
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,950
And it could be an interesting
experiment for you.

119
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,750
   

120
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,380
And actually, I was thinking,
an interesting scientific

121
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,280
experiment, or maybe a
high-school science project,

122
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,980
people have a free-throw
percentage and that kind of

123
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,550
implies that every time someone
takes a free throw that those

124
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,090
are mutually exclusive events,
that they're independent of

125
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,630
the previous time like
we said with coins.

126
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,140
But an interesting idea, you
know in basketball people

127
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,510
always say, he's hot now
or he has a streak.

128
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,020
And so there is this notion and
I know I felt it, that there

129
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,950
are times that you're
probability increases or

130
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,370
decreases, and it tends to be
maybe dependent on whether you

131
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,020
made or missed your
previous shot.

132
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,170
So one thing you might want
to-- this is, I think, a

133
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,430
legitimate science project-- is
to either get the data from

134
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,120
real NBA players and see if
they really are mutually

135
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,510
exclusive events.

136
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,820
If the probability of making
the next shot or the next free

137
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,680
throw really is independent of
whether they made or missed

138
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,500
the previous one. or whether
it actually is dependent.

139
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,320
Or if you don't have all the
data from the NBA or wherever,

140
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,250
although I suspect you could
find it, you could try it with

141
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,680
yourself and your friends.

142
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,735
Or maybe since you want to
be unbiased, you'll do

143
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:44,340
it with your friend.

144
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,670
You'll see if the probability
of them making the next free

145
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,920
throw really is independent of
whether they made the last one.

146
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,250
Actually, I think that could be
quite good and you can get

147
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,190
quite involved in the analysis.

148
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,440
So let me finish this up
with another scenario.

149
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,170
We talked about free throws, we
talked about flipping a coin,

150
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,050
and now I'll talk about dice
because that is really another

151
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,100
area where-- well, it's one
interesting and you'll probably

152
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,930
see some problems
on probability.

153
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,430
So, in general, when you're
playing games involving dice

154
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,170
it's always interesting to say,
what's the probability if I

155
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,470
have two six-sided dice, what's
my probability of getting--

156
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,040
I don't know-- a
particular number.

157
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,050
Let's say, what's the
probability of getting a 7?

158
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,210
So to think about that you have
to say, well, what has to

159
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,410
happen for the dice
for me to get a 7?

160
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,020
And I think here it
might be interesting to

161
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,680
draw a bit of a grid.

162
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,660
So let's say that's my grid.

163
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,340
Let me split it up into six.

164
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:50,990
So let's see, that's splitting
it up into one, into two.

165
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,785
Each of these maybe split
it up into three, so

166
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:54,555
it would be like that.

167
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:58,830
It won't be perfect, but close.

168
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,335
Like that.

169
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:04,710
   

170
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,160
Like that.

171
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,100
   

172
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,840
And like that.

173
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,150
And let me split it-- you'll
see what I'm doing in a second.

174
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,990
Actually, I didn't
want to do that.

175
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,560
That's good enough.

176
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,420
Do this, this.

177
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,560
I'm trying to make a 6-by-6.

178
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,830
   

179
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,080
OK, and the reason why I'm
doing this is because let's

180
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,350
make this top axis, this
horizontal-- each of the

181
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,800
situations I can get on the
first dice, although I'm going

182
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,670
to roll them simultaneously,
although it doesn't matter if I

183
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,440
roll them simultaneously or one
after the other, or I roll one

184
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,890
dice one after the other.

185
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,690
So this first dice I could get
1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6.

186
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,310
So this is dice one-- D1.

187
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,820
And on the second dice,
I could get a 1, a 2,

188
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,410
a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6.

189
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,800
And this is dice two.

190
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,170
And I'm running out of
time, so I will see

191
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,910
you in the next video.
