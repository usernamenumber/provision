00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:04,204
So if you're like me you probably don't carry around a protractor everywhere you go

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:08,609
and even if you do, you sometimes you want to have only the angles you want, because you needed a whole bunch

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:14,248
without all those other degrees getting in the way. This is the need that the Angle-A-Tron fufills.

4
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:19,987
A protractor is kinda like a 180 degree Angle-A-Tron. It's great at 180 degrees.

5
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:23,359
You can make your own 180 degree Angle-A-Tron super easily from any piece of paper.

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,294
Even if your paper doesn't have an edge, you can just fold it and ta-da Angle-A-Tron!

7
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:31,602
One extremely useful Angle-A-Tron is the 90 degree Angle-A-Tron.

8
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:34,935
Many pieces of paper come pre-equipped with one of these,

9
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:39,039
but, if they dont, you can get one by folding a 180 degree Angle-A-Tron in half.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,543
Now, you can draw all sorts of "rectangley things" and "perpendicularites".

11
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:47,180
Following the "fold stuff in half" method you can get a 45 degree Angle-A-Tron pretty easily,

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,552
or a 22.5 degrees, or a 11.25, and so on.

13
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,556
And you get these weird looking numbers, but that's only because we started with something

14
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,692
arbitrary, like 360 degrees, when, really the numbers we are looking at

15
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,562
are a half, a fourth, an eighth, a sixteenth,

16
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,098
you know, one over two to the n. It's not hard to fold paper into thirds, either.

17
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,035
Might take a litte evening out, then BAM!

18
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:11,838
180 degrees turns into 60 degrees, good for making equilateral triangles.

19
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:15,709
Or put two together and get 120 degrees, a very common and useful angle.

20
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,912
For when, say, bubbles meet, If you're drawing bubbles. Or honeycombs, or something.

21
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:25,085
Then you can start adding them together, 135 degrees is easy, 90 degrees plus 45 degrees.

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:31,319
Now you can make puzzles for yourself. Say you make a 60 degree Angle-A-Tron, and a 135 degree Angle-A-Tron,

23
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:35,462
How do you make an Angle-A-Tron that completes the circle?

24
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:40,734
Or, if a friend gives you an Angle-A-Tron, can you make a Complementary, or supplementary, I forget which is which,

25
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:46,186
Angle-A-Tron? And then, let me know if this is going a little bit too far, maybe you can put an Angle-A-Tron on

26
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:51,655
your Angle-A-Tron. And now, I have a 60 degrees, and another 60 degrees, which comes over here,

27
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:56,416
to make another 60 degrees, and now I have an equilateral Triangle Polygon-A-Tron!

28
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:00,416
And just in case you thought that wasn't going to far, Why not make that a Polyhedron-A-Tron?
