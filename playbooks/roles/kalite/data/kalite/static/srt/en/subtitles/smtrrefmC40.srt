1
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:11,477
and a right angle at C. So let's just try to draw that.

2
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:14,709
let's draw that, let's draw the right angle maybe we have to use some coordinates, so let's draw

3
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:17,479
the right angle at the origin.

4
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:21,119
So, let's say that this is C right over here.

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,189
AC = 7, so A will be put over here, this distance here

6
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,929
is going to be seven

7
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:32,309
and then we have the hypotenuse of our triangle.

8
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:34,520
and this can be

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,720
B, this distance over here they tell us, BC

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,810
is equal to twenty four.

11
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,640
All right.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,140
Now point M is the midpoint of AB so point
M is right over here let me do that in a different

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,280
color

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,340
point M

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,190
is the midpoint

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,510
it's the midpoint of AB so this distance
is equal to that distance

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,600
and D is on the same side of AB.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,960
So, D is on the same side of AB as C, so C is on this side you can call that

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,450
left of the bottom left-hand side of AB

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,880
So that AD is equal to BD is equal
to fifteen.

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,350
So D is going to be some place over here.

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,210
It's going to be

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,299
equal distant between enviada see all of
a point equal distant between a and b_ are

24
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,360
going to sit on a line that looks

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,970
something like that this is the midpoint of
abt so do you going to sit right over here

26
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,369
and it's fifteen away from both they and b

27
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:35,770
sold look something like that that distance
over their is fifteen

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:42,240
and then at this distance this distance over
here it is also going to be fifteen

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,950
given that the area of triangle cd and

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,730
so the area of triangle cd and this is d so
see

31
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,110
the

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,680
and is the triangle that

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,520
they wanna

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,180
think about given to the area title cbm maybe
expressed as and times of squirted andover

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,900
p were and and and p<u>r</u> positive integers

36
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,799
and an end

37
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,480
p<u>r</u> relatively prior to that just means you
can simplify and and is not the divisible

38
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,240
by the square of any prime so kind and his

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,149
uh... you've simplify the radical as much
as possible

40
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:18,209
find and plus and plus peace researcher unified

41
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:24,829
the area the area of this green triangle of
the cd m over here and so if you look at what

42
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,939
we can do

43
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:29,619
to figure it out so we could try some of the
court it's for some of these points

44
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:31,970
so displayed right over here a

45
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,549
is going to be it's excise going to be seven
i could rub quarter to cc what i'm doing that

46
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:38,289
could be the x-axis

47
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:39,499
and in this

48
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:42,199
side is on the y_ axis

49
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,079
quartet for a would be seven

50
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,290
common zero

51
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:51,359
cornett for c_ would be zero com zero and
quartet for be would be twenty four

52
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:54,059
so i would be zero twenty four

53
00:02:54,059 --> 00:03:00,219
zero twenty-four so the court date four and
would just be the average of d<u>n</u>a_

54
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,809
so the court it for and the average of zero
and seven eighths seven house

55
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,679
and the court that four

56
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:10,189
the white cord at governor twenty four and
zero is

57
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,719
toward alpha

58
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,989
that's fair enough now to what we can figure
out about the side so you know this is a right

59
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,499
triangles or got reaction is always to use
the protagonist and we know the side and that

60
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:21,110
side

61
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,769
before one of the red in b

62
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,429
we could just say that

63
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:27,649
we just know that twenty-four squared

64
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:30,120
plus seven squared

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,779
is equal to

66
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:37,219
is equaled two a v is equal to a be squared

67
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:43,029
and twenty-four squared is five hundred and
seventy-six plus forty-nine is equal to

68
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:45,369
a the squared

69
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:48,920
and a c five seventy six post forty nine

70
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,449
if it was plus fifty would give us two five

71
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,929
twenty who is a six twenty six points one
lesson that's a six twenty five

72
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:59,959
so six twenty five is equal to

73
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,299
a<u>b</u>

74
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,370
squid aired so it be is going to equal twenty
five

75
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,180
so a v

76
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,639
is equal to twenty five so this distance thus
the distance of this big harp on this year's

77
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,609
twenty five

78
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:16,790
half of the distance this is going to be twenty-five
over too

79
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,969
from the dam

80
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,250
from m<u>t</u>a_ is also going to be

81
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,189
twenty-five over to you

82
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:24,030
now the other thing we know

83
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,219
the other thing that we know

84
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,620
is that

85
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,600
am right over here

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,729
amma right over here and the triangle see
and is a nice also leads triangle how do we

87
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:35,680
know that

88
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,640
wool and if you look at specs quartet it's
excoriate is directly in between the export

89
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,759
its for c<u>n</u>n_ seven have since the average

90
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,789
this is seven

91
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:50,050
this is the url it's important as writer of
this directly above the midpoint of this base

92
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,959
over here

93
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,889
so this is going to be a nice awfully strangle
some after cubic foot the triangle oversold

94
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,569
this length

95
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:00,199
this length of the seems useful 'cause this
is kind of the base of the area that of the

96
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:00,559
truck

97
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,619
the base of the triangle we care about

98
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:05,520
the kind of you this is the base of cd m

99
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,599
this is also going to be twenty-five over
to you

100
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,649
twenty-five rotors i softly strangled this
is going to be the same is that because we're

101
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,479
symmetric around this

102
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,899
right over here

103
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,079
so c we know one side of this triangle

104
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,579
but if we could figure out decide over here
seems pretty straight forward this is going

105
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:24,639
to be a right

106
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,609
triangle right over here because in this line

107
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:31,070
from deep dam is going to be perpendicular
to a b

108
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,469
all of the points that are equal distance

109
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:34,789
between in b

110
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:37,669
are going to be on the line that is perpendicular

111
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:39,039
those perpendicular

112
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,409
to a<u>b</u>

113
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,830
so this is going to be a right wrangle so
we can figure out d<u>m</u>

114
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,439
using the protagonist theorem again

115
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,809
we get twenty-five over to squared

116
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:52,280
twenty-five over too

117
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,460
school where'd

118
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,779
plus d<u>m</u> squared

119
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,979
plus the and squared

120
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,729
plus the and squared is going to be equal
to fifteen square is what he called a hypothesis

121
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,539
this triangles twenty equal two hundred

122
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,580
and twenty five

123
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,659
and so what do we get we get d<u>m</u> squared

124
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:14,879
d<u>n</u>

125
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,589
squared is equal to

126
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:18,770
to twenty-five minus

127
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,719
six twenty five over

128
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:25,569
four sauce for the soul force of two twenty
five or four or to twenty-five with for the

129
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,219
nominee of the same thing is nine hundred

130
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,179
nine hundred over four

131
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:32,139
in the last video actually figure

132
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,839
died mistakenly said that it over for was
one twenty five agassi boneheaded mistake

133
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,209
with the number show up again here so to twenty-five
obscene niner

134
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,349
over for

135
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:42,080
amra subtract from that

136
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,360
six twenty five over four

137
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,999
minus six twenty five

138
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,229
over four

139
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,979
and uh... this is he cool too

140
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,760
cian taryn numerator

141
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,120
let's see we have not heard my six twenty
five would be three hundred minus twenty is

142
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,659
going to two hundred

143
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,790
two hundred and seventy-five

144
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,849
over four

145
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,449
and so d<u>m</u>

146
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,110
is going to be equal to the square root of

147
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,300
this citicorp to the square root

148
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,479
of two seventy five or four to seventy five
is twenty five

149
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,269
times eleven twenty five times twelve would
be three hundred twenty-five times eleven

150
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,210
or for

151
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,179
so this is going to be equal to five square
roots of eleven

152
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,439
over too

153
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,189
sodium is five square roots of eleven or her
too

154
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,839
now if we could just figure out

155
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,069
so when you do here is figure out the height
of this triangle right over here we could

156
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:40,129
figure out the height of that triangle where
we're pretty much done one-half the base times

157
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,240
a height

158
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,449
but we don't know who see we could figure
that if we know the loft co-signed into something

159
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:48,569
over there for another sign of the single
right over here

160
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,519
if we know the sign of that angle the side
of that angles going to be this

161
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,050
over

162
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,969
the side we just figured out

163
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:58,550
sofa to figure out the side of that angle

164
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,449
then we'd be done or robi very close to being
done that's not any obvious way

165
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,139
but one thing we can do if you look at this
bigger triangle overhear salami highlighted

166
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,189
so if you look at triangle be and c

167
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,169
redraw triangle bmc

168
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,280
devote artist

169
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,809
from destroying right over here and want to
get to overload of the triangle b

170
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:20,839
amma

171
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,369
see right over here

172
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:28,090
we know this side twenty-five over to we know
this side over here twenty five or two

173
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,849
we know this side over years twenty four

174
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:31,990
and we know this

175
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,519
so what we want to do is figure out the sign
of the single right here the sign of data

176
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,180
of anglesey and d

177
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,160
now that's hard to do but what we can't do
is use a lot of course i had the stayed up

178
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,590
last ninety

179
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,390
so let's let me let me redraw are triangle

180
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,050
so triangle pcm

181
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,210
i could redraw like this

182
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,490
i could read right actually nice awfully struggle

183
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,460
so we have b

184
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,750
c

185
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,900
and what is this a will right over here

186
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,990
it's going to be art fair that we care about
plus a ninety degrees

187
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,010
so this angle right here is data

188
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,749
data plus ninety degrees

189
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:14,350
and this overhears twenty four this is twenty
five over too

190
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,760
and this is twenty five over to you

191
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,909
if they're using this week a diesel off ko
signs to figure out

192
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,160
to figure out what

193
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,520
data actually is here

194
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,930
so listen to that

195
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,300
raise a little bit of trig identities but
love co side so we get

196
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,150
the opposite to the angle squared so we get
twenty-four squared

197
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,960
twenty-four squared is equal to twenty five
over to squared

198
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,210
twenty-five over to squared plus twenty five
over to squared

199
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,390
plus twenty five over to squared minus

200
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,110
two times twenty five over too

201
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,850
times twenty five over too

202
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,150
times of the co-signed of this angle

203
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,540
times of misc rollover

204
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,840
the cosign

205
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,060
data

206
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,990
data plus

207
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,430
data plus ninety degrees now you're saying
hey sal you know

208
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,450
this has it in terms of cosign the state a
plus side agrees huckabee figure out the side

209
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,030
of

210
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,829
data that's what we actually care about

211
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:14,970
to figure out the area of the strike a lecture
to figure out the height

212
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,290
of this triangle

213
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,389
and to do that you just have to

214
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:21,350
maker of the realization that we know the
trader identity

215
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,910
we know the trigger identity the because side
of data

216
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,510
is equal i want you state archives are overloaded
a cosigner acs

217
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,040
is equal to sign

218
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,400
of nineteen minus x

219
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,170
so the co-sign if they don't plus nine degrees

220
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,310
so the co-sign of data plus ninety degrees

221
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,810
is going to be equal to the sign of

222
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,760
preferences ninety minus whatever zern nineteen
minus data

223
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,300
minus ninety

224
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,649
which is are called to

225
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,650
the nineties cancel out

226
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,019
sign of negative data

227
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:59,610
and will sign a mega date is equal to

228
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,020
the negative assigned uh...

229
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,340
so this over here simplifies too

230
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,700
this is a negative sign the status of the
right the scientist data here

231
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,060
and then put the negative out here in this
becomes a positive so what is a simple fight

232
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,320
with twenty-four squared

233
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,110
which is five hundred and seventy-six

234
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,770
five hundred seventy six is equal to

235
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,980
let's see we have

236
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,320
loudest i won't skip any steps here so we
have twenty five square plus twenty five squared

237
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,170
this is to times twenty five

238
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,430
this is too

239
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,950
two times twenty-five or two

240
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,860
school where'd

241
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,400
squared plus

242
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,850
to times this is twenty five over to squared
again two times twenty five over to squared

243
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,230
times signed uh...

244
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:54,620
now we just have to sulfur sign of paid us
so this is going to be equal to

245
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,560
five seventy six

246
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,130
is the called too

247
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,940
to trying to play five over to squared

248
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,999
factoring that out

249
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:07,280
one plus sign us data

250
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,830
one-plus sign of kato or

251
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,440
we can just divide both sides of the equation
by this yeshiva me to simplify it this thing

252
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,249
overhears

253
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:16,980
six twenty five

254
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,509
four

255
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:22,470
for the remarkable i dot by two so this thing
over here is the six twenty five

256
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,520
over too

257
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,200
source the by both sides of this by six twenty
five over to and we get

258
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,710
five seventy six

259
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,570
times

260
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,730
times to over six twenty five

261
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,490
to smoke applying both sides by the inverse
is equal to a new model bible time either

262
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,360
said this asa cancels out

263
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,020
is equal to

264
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,290
one

265
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,670
plus sinus data

266
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,970
scientist a that we just subtract one from
both sides we get sign of state a

267
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,730
is equal to five seventy six times to see
say six times tues one fifty

268
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,460
plus a thousand sos one thousand one hundred
and fifty two

269
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,400
over

270
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,369
six hundred and twenty-five that's that part
of their minus one

271
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:09,660
recive one mostly six twenty five or six twenty
five so minus six

272
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,890
twenty five

273
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,300
and uh... this is he pulled to after dual
math on the side

274
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,950
so one thousand one hundred fifty two

275
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,640
minus six hundred and twenty five

276
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,550
you get a twelve there's becomes a for twelve
months five seven four minus two is to eleven

277
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,120
minus six is five

278
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,900
so this is equal to five hundred and twenty
seven over six twenty five

279
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,560
now you might not realize it more in the home
stretch alice let's draw

280
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,650
let me broaden this cd and triangle on that

281
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,850
is really the focus of the problem of the
drug a little bit differently

282
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,530
let me try it

283
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,310
you dropped slightly differently so now we
know it's a very interesting things about

284
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,950
cd into the sissy

285
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,199
this is d

286
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,310
and this is an we know this side over here

287
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,270
mr dot is five hafte

288
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,480
squared eleven

289
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,300
five over to times the square root eleven
that's the length

290
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,080
of the and

291
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,460
we also know

292
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,740
that cm right over here is twenty five over
too

293
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,370
we also know that sign of data here

294
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,310
we also know that sign of data is equal to
five hundred and twenty seven

295
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,140
over at six twenty five that's what we just
figured out

296
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,770
and we can use that to figure out the height

297
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,080
the heights of this triangle

298
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,400
because we know that side is is the opposite
over the hype on his if we draw our right

299
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,750
triangle right here so scientist data

300
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,870
which is five twenty seven or six twenty five
is equal to the opposite is equal to the heart

301
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,330
of this triangle

302
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,260
is equal to the higher this triangle over
the hype on his over

303
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,960
five over to square roots of eleven

304
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,139
so d'amato by both sides of this by five squirts
of

305
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,400
five over to squirts eleven

306
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,590
and we get

307
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,000
the high of the triangle is equal to five
hundred and twenty seven

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,540
over six hundred and twenty five

309
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,610
times

310
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,290
five

311
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,770
over too

312
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,980
square roots

313
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,269
of eleven relatively can divide

314
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:12,490
six twenty five divide by five is one hundred
and twenty five so you get up

315
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,880
one here and you have a one hundred and twenty-five
over here

316
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,920
so this is equal to

317
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,020
five hundred and twenty seven

318
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,840
square roots eleven

319
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,499
over

320
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:26,850
one twenty-five times too which is two hundred

321
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,290
two hundred and fifty that's the height now
with the area of the triangle it's one-half

322
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,740
base times height

323
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,820
area is able to one-half base

324
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,240
which is twenty five over too

325
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,630
twenty-five over two times a height

326
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,980
which we just figured out is

327
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,410
five twenty seven two square roots of eleven
over two hundred and fifty

328
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,430
the seat twenty five divide the numerator
by twenty five by the nominal by twenty five

329
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,640
years tender

330
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,730
so this is equal to

331
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,150
five hundred and twenty seven

332
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,779
square roots of eleven

333
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:07,149
over two times two times ten which is sporty
so that's our area the whole problem they

334
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:10,890
didn't want to find the area they want us
to find and plus and plus p

335
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,530
and plus and plus pizza they want us to find
essentially five twenty seven plus eleven

336
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,080
plus forty

337
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,930
five twenty seven

338
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,310
plus eleven

339
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,750
plus forty

340
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:29,750
so five twenty seven plus the eleven is five
penetrated this five hundred thirty-eight

341
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,840
and then plus forty is five hundred and seventy-eight
and were done
