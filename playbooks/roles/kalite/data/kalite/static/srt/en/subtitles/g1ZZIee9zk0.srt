99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Before we do some alkene nomenclature, let's look at two famous alkenes.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, over here on the left we have (R) - limonene.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, the -ene ending gives away the fact that limonene has double bonds in it.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, (R) - limonene smells like oranges.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it's the molecule that gives oranges its smell.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, even if you've never heard of the limonene molecule you've definitely smelled it before.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Over here on the right we have another alkene called alpha-pinene, so the -ene ending tells you that

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there's an alkene or double bond present in the molecule.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Alpha-pinene is one of the main constituents of turpentine,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which most people know is a solvent used in oil painting.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And, some people think that turpentine has a bad smell to it,

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's incorrect there are definitely some bad forms of turpentine but if you get some high-quality turpentine

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
alpha-pinene has a very, very nice smell.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So limonene and pinene two molecules with great smells to them.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's take a look at some simpler alkenes and see if we can name them...

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if I were to look at an alkene, and it looks like this... let's go like that,

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
put our double bond right here...

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And how would I name this according to IUPAC nomenclature?

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, when we named our alkanes the first thing we did was found our longest carbon chain.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're going to do the same thing for alkenes,

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Except this time we're going to find our longest carbon chain that includes our double bond.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the longest carbon chain that includes our double bond...

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it could go like this.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that would be our longest carbon chain including our double bond.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And how many carbons is that?

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
One, two, three, four, five, six.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Six total carbons.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When we were naming alkanes we called our six carbon alkane, we called that hexane.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Obviously we can no longer use that name.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We do have six carbons,

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We do have six carbons but we have a double bond present.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
...in the molecule so it is an alkene instead of an alkane.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we've just seen how the -ene ending is used to identify alkenes.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So instead of an -ane ending for an alkane we're going to use an -ene ending.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So instead of hexane we're going to call this hexene.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When I go to my next step I'm going to need to number my carbon chain.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I'll number it to give my double bond the lest number possible.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I have two options, I could start with this carbon on the right... I could make that carbon number one,

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or I could start with this carbon down at the bottom I could make that carbon number one.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You want to give your double bond the lowest number possible.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I'm going to start with the carbon at the top right,

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to be carbon one.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if this is carbon one, this must be carbon two,

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
carbon three, four, five, and six.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So my double bond starts at carbon two so I'm going to

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
go ahead and put a 2 in front of this and make it 2-hexene.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's implied that the double bond finishes at the next carbon.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the double bond spans the distance between carbon two and carbon three.
