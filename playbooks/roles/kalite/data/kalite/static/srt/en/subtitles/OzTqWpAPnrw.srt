1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,020
We're on problem 116.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:12,610
What is the value of a plus b squared? Statement 1.

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:20,060
Statement 1 tells us that a times b is equal to 0.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,740
That, to me, seems fairly useless.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,840
Let me see, what if we expand that out.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,090
That's equal to to a squared plus 2ab plus b squared.

7
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,030
This is the same thing. I just expanded out a plus b squared.

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,750
And so they're giving us a piece.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,890
They're telling us that this term right here is going to be

10
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,580
equal to 0. If ab is equal to 0,

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,470
this term right here is going to be equal to 0.

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,000
But we still don't know what a squared and b squared are.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,020
So statement 1 by itself: not so useful. Statement 2.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:01,850
a minus b squared is equal to 36. This is interesting.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,080
So let's expand this out a little bit.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,660
So this tells us-- so you might want to say,

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,620
oh that means that a minus b is plus or minus 6.

18
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,020
But actually I don't think that is going to help you as much.

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,570
Well actually, that could help you as well.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,590
But the way I'm thinking about it is, let's expand this out.

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:36,070
We get a squared minus 2ab plus b squared is equal to 36.

22
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,070
So, by itself the statement isn't that useful.

23
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,120
I mean, even hereŁŹthe statement says that if you

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,310
were to take the square root of both sides,

25
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,480
it tells us that the difference between a and b

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,010
is either positive 6 or negative 6.

27
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,100
If you took the square root of both sides.

28
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,840
So statement 2 by itself is kind of useless.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,430
But if you use them together,

30
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,010
you expand out statement 2 you get this.

31
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,720
Now if we also take in statement 1 and say, oh,

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,400
ab is equal to 0. So then that is equal to 0.

33
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,060
And we're left with a squared plus b squared is equal to 36.

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,710
And if a squared plus b squared is equal to 36, then we

35
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,190
know that this a squared plus b squared is also equal to 36.

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:25,710
So that tells us that a plus b squared is equal to 36 as well

37
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,470
So both statements together are sufficient.

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,680
And this is interesting.

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,630
Because if you think about it, it makes a lot of sense.

40
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,050
This statement tells us that the difference between a and

41
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,250
b-- and this is all a waste of time, but I just want to give

42
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,500
you some intuition-- this tells us that a minus b is

43
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,030
equal to plus or minus 6.

44
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,730
So it tells you that the difference between a and b is

45
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,150
either positive 6 or minus 6.

46
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,660
So one is 6 bigger than the other but we don't know which

47
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,180
way it goes.

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,000
This statement tells us that one of them is equal to 0.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,870
Both of them aren't going to be equal to 0 because there's

50
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,030
a 6 difference.

51
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,580
So if one of them is equal to 0, then the other one is

52
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,380
either going to be plus or minus 6.

53
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,160
If we look at this statement, one of these numbers is 0.

54
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,410
The other one is plus or minus 6. But it doesn't matter.

55
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,100
If one is 0 and one is plus 6, and you square it, you get 36.

56
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,540
If one is 0 and the other is minus 6,you square it,you get 36

57
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,260
So anyway, just want to give you that little intuition.

58
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,960
But the correct answer is that both statements together are

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,620
necessary to solve this problem.

60
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,320
117. The more connections you can make while doing these math

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,650
problems, the better you'll be, really the better off

62
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,600
you'll be in life, I think. It will all start making sense.

63
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,000
All right, they've drawn this thing.

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,730
And then they draw this down like that.

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:08,010
Let's see. This is L, M, N and K.

66
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,240
In the figure above, what is the ratio of KN to MN?

67
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,290
So they want to know the ratio of this side, KN to MN.

68
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,810
Fair enough. OK.

69
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,530
Statement number 1 tells us the perimeter of rectangle

70
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:44,450
KLMN is 30 meters. So this is a rectangle, right?

71
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,260
So that tells us that-- let's put it in terms of the things

72
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,520
that we care about-- that 2 times MN-- because MN and KL

73
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,220
are going to be the same length, since it's a rectangle.

74
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:01,740
So this tells us that 2 times MN plus 2 times KN--

75
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,480
because KN and LM are the same length.

76
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,740
So let's just put it in the terms of the things we care about

77
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:14,110
Plus 2 times KN is equal to 30. That's the perimeter.

78
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,470
Twice this plus twice this. That's the perimeter.

79
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,050
You could say that plus that plus that plus that.

80
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,260
But this keeps it in terms of that. So I think we can solve.

81
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:30,280
Let's divide both sides by 2.

82
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:41,720
You get MN plus KN is equal to 30. And actually, yeah,

83
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,410
you still can't figure out the ratio between the two.

84
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,580
You just know that the sum of the two are equal to 30.

85
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's look at statement 2.

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,010
You can't figure out the ratio from this.

87
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:01,030
Statement 2 tells us the three small rectangles have the same

88
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,780
dimensions.

89
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,290
This is interesting. So that's telling us.

90
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,870
Well that's interesting.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,970
Because that tells us that this distance and this

92
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,020
distance have to be the same.

93
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,360
That tells us that-- and if this distance and this

94
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,660
distance are the same, then this distance right there is

95
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,690
twice this distance. How did I get that?

96
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,080
Well this distance is twice each of this these distances.

97
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:46,010
This longer side of this horizontal rectangle is twice this.

98
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,060
And this is the same thing as this.

99
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,690
So for all of these rectangles,

100
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,390
their ratio of their sides is 1:2. So

101
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,040
let's create a unit called the short side of this rectangle.

102
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,740
So how many units long is MN?

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,090
Well MN is going to be, this side right here is going to be

104
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,880
two of those units long. So, 1, 2, and then 3.

105
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,840
We figured that out because the long side of this is

106
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,120
twice as long as the short side.

107
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,400
So if we were measuring these in terms of the short sides of

108
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:29,040
the rectangle,MN is 3 of them and then KN is 2 of them. 1, 2.

109
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,000
So the ratio of KN to MN, it doesn't matter what units you

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
measure in, you just want to get the ratio.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,090
So the ratio is going to be equal to 2 to 3.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,020
So statement 2 alone is sufficient to solve this problem.

113
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,800
Next question.

114
00:07:50,620 --> 00:08:00,060
118. If n is a positive integer, is 150 over n an integer?

115
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,030
So it's essentially asking us, is n divisible into 150?

116
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,060
That's the only way that 150 over n is going to be an integer

117
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:14,020
Statement number 1 tells us that n is less than 7.

118
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,030
Now if every number less than 7 is divisible into 150,

119
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,080
then we're all set. Because we know it's positive as well.

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,030
And 1 works. 2 works, 75. 3 works, 50.

121
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:37,440
4-- let's see 4 goes into 100 and then does it go into 50?

122
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,580
4 goes into 50-- no it doesn't go into 50.

123
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,040
So 4 does not work.

124
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,090
So just by telling us that n is less than 7 does not solve

125
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,380
the problem.

126
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,340
Because if n was 4, 4 does not go into 150 evenly.

127
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,450
It goes into it-- no, I'm not going to figure it out.

128
00:08:53,090 --> 00:09:01,000
4 goes into it-- it goes in 25, 25 plus 12, 37.5 times.

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,320
So that doesn't do us any good.

130
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,010
Statement 1 by itself isn't that useful. Statement 2.

131
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,040
n is a prime number. n is prime.

132
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,180
So this statement by itself is not useful.

133
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,780
Because, I mean n could be a prime number larger than 150.

134
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:23,060
So that by itself doesn't tell us that we definitely can get

135
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,810
an integer. And n could easily be 1 or 3, which would allow it.

136
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,290
So n doesn't tell you one way or

137
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,100
another whether this is an integer.

138
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,920
But if you combine the two statements, if you say that n

139
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,990
is a prime number that has to be less than 7,

140
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,010
then we can take 4 out of the picture. Because 4 isn't prime.

141
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,700
And then you put 5 there. 5 definitely does go into 150.

142
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,830
And then 6, 6 does go into 150. It goes into 120.

143
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,300
And then 30 leftover, so 6 goes one twice.

144
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,530
So all of the prime numbers less than 7are divisible into 150

145
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,650
So both statements combined are sufficient

146
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,000
to answer this question.

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
See you in the next video.
