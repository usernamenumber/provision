1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Based on what we learned in the
last video, let's see if

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,800
we can name these two
molecules here.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,630
Let's start with
this blue one.

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,410
So the first thing we notice,
it is an alkene.

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,140
It has a double bond
right there.

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,750
So we can, right from the get
go, write that it's going to

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,780
end with an ene.

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,470
And then we need to figure
out what the longest

10
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,790
carbon chain is.

11
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,120
And it looks like it's
this one here.

12
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,680
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven carbons.

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:31,310
So it's going to be hept as
our prefix on the alkene.

14
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,080
Let me write it out a little
bit further to the left.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,060
And then we have to figure out
where the double bond is.

16
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,410
And we always want to start
numbering our carbons from the

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,630
direction that bumps into the
double bond first. And so the

18
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,300
double bond is closer
to this end of the

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,220
chain than that end.

20
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,540
So we're going to start
numbering here.

21
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:54,720
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

22
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,320
And so the double bond starts
on the three carbon.

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,550
So it is hept-3-ene.

24
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,270
And we also have a
functional group.

25
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,550
We have a methyl group sitting
on the number four carbon.

26
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:16,280
So it is 4-methylhept-3-ene,
which is correct.

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
But we still haven't considered
what's going on, on

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,010
either side of the
double bond.

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,970
Whether the higher priority
functional group is closer to

30
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,960
each other on both sides of
the double bond or whether

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,690
they're farther away
from each other.

32
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,970
And to do that we first have
to identify the higher

33
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,490
priority group on each side
of the double bond.

34
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,000
So on the right side of the
double bond-- let me circle it

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,780
in magenta on each side-- so
on the right side of the

36
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,250
double bond, we only
have one functional

37
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,580
group, right over here.

38
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,160
You could view this
as an ethyl group.

39
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,040
That's pretty obvious.

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,360
There is no other functional
group bonded to the carbon.

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,250
There's only a hydrogen
over here.

42
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,540
Now on the left side it's a
little bit less obvious.

43
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,580
We have two functional groups
from the point of

44
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,780
view of this carbon.

45
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,130
You have the methyl that we
already pointed out, and you

46
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,160
also have these three carbons
right over here.

47
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,980
You could view that
as a propyl group.

48
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,470
And what we need to do to
identify the highest priority

49
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,220
group is to use the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog namings or

50
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,950
priority scheme that we learned
several videos ago.

51
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,540
And there you literally go from
this carbon, you look at

52
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,390
what it's bonded to, and you
compare the atomic numbers.

53
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,570
But in both cases it's
a carbon to a carbon.

54
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,330
This is a carbon to a carbon.

55
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,440
So their atomic numbers
are the same.

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,450
So then you go one bond further
away and you see which

57
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,140
one is bonded to a higher
atomic number atom.

58
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,830
This carbon bonds to a
carbon, which is a

59
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,940
higher atomic number.

60
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,850
This carbon only bonds
to three hydrogens.

61
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,940
This one does two hydrogens
and one carbon.

62
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,000
Because it's bonded to another
carbon, it takes priority.

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,620
This propyl group is a higher
priority functional group.

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,120
So now when we're trying to
decide whether it is entgegen

65
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,770
or zusammen, we look
at these 2 groups.

66
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,360
And we see that they are sitting
on the same side of

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,090
the double bond.

68
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,720
They are both above
the carbons.

69
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,680
They are closer to each other.

70
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,030
So this molecule is zusammen.

71
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,350
Which on some levels, you can
think of as the same thing as

72
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,350
cis, but cis and trans stops
applying when you start having

73
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,770
more than two functional
groups.

74
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,010
In this case, we have three.

75
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:24,570
So we would call this
Z-4-methylhept-3-ene.

76
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,780
And that's because the higher
priority functional groups are

77
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,880
on the same side of
the double bond.

78
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,390
Now let's do this
one over here.

79
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,930
And someone pointed out,
rightly, that I had misspelled

80
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,150
zusammen in the last video.

81
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,880
It's actually spelled
like this, zusammen.

82
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,260
I had spelled it with
two s's and one m.

83
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,350
I guess you can forgive me.

84
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,580
I don't speak German.

85
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,770
But anyway, I thought I
would point that out.

86
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,820
Now let's try to label this
thing right over here.

87
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,530
So the first thing, this once
again is an alkene.

88
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,510
Let's identify the longest
carbon chain here.

89
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,160
So it looks like one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

90
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,670
eight carbons.

91
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,740
Double bonds are closer
to the left hand side.

92
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,390
So we will start
numbering here.

93
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:10,140
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

94
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,770
So just the main chain is oct--
let me make sure I have

95
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:21,310
some space here--
it is oct-3-ene.

96
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,630
And then we have, well we have
one functional group sitting

97
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,920
off of the main chain.

98
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,460
We have this bromine sitting
right over there

99
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,950
on the third carbon.

100
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,345
So we would call this
3-bromooct-3-ene.

101
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:40,630
   

102
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,400
And now we have to figure out
is it entgegen or zusammen.

103
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,430
So if we look on the carbon on
the right hand side, it's

104
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,410
pretty obvious that this is
the only functional group.

105
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,720
We just have a hydrogen there.

106
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,130
So let me circle it
in the magenta.

107
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,350
   

108
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,550
And then on the left hand side
we have two functional groups.

109
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,080
We have this [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

110
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,900
bromo or we have a bromine
sitting right there.

111
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,550
And then we have this
propyl group.

112
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,260
And because this propyl group
is bigger, you might be

113
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,310
tempted to say it takes
higher priority.

114
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,580
But remember, in the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, you

115
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,860
give higher priority to
the atom that has a

116
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,330
higher atomic number.

117
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,100
Bromine has an atomic
number of 35.

118
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,780
Carbon has an atomic
number of only 6.

119
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,810
So Bromine is actually
higher priority.

120
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,460
So this is the higher
priority functional

121
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,240
group right over here.

122
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,120
So now for deciding whether it's
entgegen or zusammen, we

123
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,840
see that our higher priority
groups are apart.

124
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,060
They're on opposite sides
of the double bond.

125
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,620
This one is on top.

126
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,190
This one is below.

127
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,370
We are apart.

128
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,120
So this is entgegen.

129
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,095
Or we would write this is
E-3-bromooct-3-ene.

130
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:53,130
   

131
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,850
And E is for-- just as a bit
of a refresher-- it's for

132
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,660
entgegen, a word that I enjoy
saying, entgegen.

133
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,910
There you go.

134
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,270
