00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,600
Welcome to the presentation on level one exponent rules.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,150
Let's get started with some problems.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,824
So if I were to ask you what two--

4
00:00:11,824 --> 00:00:13,737
that's a little fatter than I wanted it to be,

5
00:00:13,737 --> 00:00:15,942
but let's keep it fat so it doesn't look strange--

6
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:19,414
two to the third times --

7
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:21,745
and dot is another way of saying times--

8
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:26,861
if I were to ask you what two to the third times two to the fifth is,

9
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:27,945
how would you figure that out?

10
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,610
Actually, let me use a skinnier pen because that does look bad.

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,120
So, two to the third times two to the fifth.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,610
Well there's one way that I think you do know how to do it.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,088
You could figure out that two to the third is eight,

14
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:45,611
and that two to the fifth is thirty-two.

15
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:46,840
And then you could multiply them.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:54,010
And eight times thirty-two is two hundred forty plus sixteen, it's two hundred fifty-six, right?

17
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,422
You could do it that way.

18
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,365
And that's reasonable,

19
00:00:56,365 --> 00:01:00,520
because it's not that hard to figure out what two to the third is and what two to the fifth is.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,781
But if those were much larger numbers this method might become a little difficult.

21
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:11,628
So I'm going to show you, using exponent rules, you can actually multiply exponentials or exponent numbers

22
00:01:11,628 --> 00:01:15,115
without actually having to do as much arithmetic.

23
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:20,874
Or actually you could handle numbers much larger than your normal math skills might allow you to.

24
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:24,798
So let's just think what two to the third times two to the fifth means.

25
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:32,940
Two to the third is two times two times two, right?

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,200
And we're multiplying that times two to the fifth.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:43,160
And that's two times two times two times two times two.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,200
So what do we have here?

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,993
We have two times two times two,

30
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:47,102
times,

31
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:49,780
two times two times two times two times two.

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,640
Really all we're doing is we're multiplying two how many times?

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,920
Well, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,410
So that's the same thing as two to the eighth.

35
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,050
Interesting.

36
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,200
Three plus five is equal to eight.

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,852
And that makes sense because two to the three is two multiplying by itself three times,

38
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:16,446
to the fifth is two multiplying by itself five times,

39
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:17,540
and then we're multiplying the two,

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,980
so we're going to multiply two eight times.

41
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,720
I hope I achieved my goal of confusing you just now.

42
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,303
Let's do another one.

43
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:33,772
If I said seven squared times seven to the fourth.

44
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,550
That's a four.

45
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,180
Well, that equals seven times seven, right, that's seven squared,

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,430
times and now let's do seven to the fourth.

47
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,290
Seven times seven times seven times seven.

48
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,672
Well now we're multiplying seven by itself six times,

49
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,590
so that equals seven to the sixth.

50
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,699
So in general, whenever I'm multiplying exponents of the same base, that's key,

51
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,620
I can just add the exponents.

52
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:13,397
So seven to the one hundredth power times seven to the fiftieth power--

53
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:15,440
and notice this is an example now--

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,304
It would be very hard without a computer to figure out what seven to the one hundredth power is.

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,052
And likewise, very hard without a computer to figure out what seven to the fiftieth power is.

56
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:32,730
But we could say that this is equal to seven to the one hundred plus fifty,

57
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,790
which is equal to seven to the one hundred fifty.

58
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,292
Now I just want to give you a little bit of warning,

59
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,630
make sure that you're multiplying.

60
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:49,150
Because if I had seven to the one hundred plus seven to the fifty,

61
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,590
there's actually very little I could do here.

62
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,440
I couldn't simplify this number.

63
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,710
But I'll throw out one to you.

64
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:04,364
If I had two to the eighth times two to the twentieth.

65
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:06,570
Well, we know we can add these exponents.

66
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,500
So that gives you two to the twenty-eighth, right?

67
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:20,820
What if I had two to the eighth plus two to the eighth?

68
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,890
This is a bit of a trick question.

69
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,892
Well I just said if we're adding, we can't really do anything.

70
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,530
We can't really simplify it.

71
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,962
But there's a little trick here that we actually have two two to the eighths, right?

72
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,080
There's two to the eighth times one, two to the eighth times two.

73
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,240
So this is the same thing as two times two to the eighth, isn't it?

74
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,073
Two times two to the eighth.

75
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,940
That's just two to the eighth plus itself.

76
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,430
And two times two to the eighth,

77
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:53,170
well that's the same thing as two to the first times two to the eighth.

78
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:59,008
And two to the first times two to the eighth, by the same rule we just did, is equal to two to the ninth.

79
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,080
So I thought I would just throw that out to you.

80
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,280
And it works even with negative exponents.

81
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:15,348
If I were to say five to the negative one hundred times three to the say, one hundred

82
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,370
oh sorry, times five -- this has to be a five, too.

83
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,140
I don't know what my brain was doing.

84
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:24,688
Five to the negative one hundred times five to the one hundred two,

85
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:27,890
that would equal five squared, right?

86
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,930
I just take minus one hundred plus one hundred two.

87
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,940
This is a five.

88
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm sorry for that brain malfunction.

89
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,860
And of course, that equals twenty-five.

90
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,210
So that's the first exponent rule.

91
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,206
Now I'm going to show you another one,

92
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,900
and it kind of leads from the same thing.

93
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:54,111
If I were to ask you what two to the ninth over two to the tenth equals--

94
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:56,940
Wow! That looks like that could be a little confusing.

95
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,058
But it actually turns out to be the same rule.

96
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:03,110
Because what's another way of writing this?

97
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,360
Well, we know that this is also the same thing as two to the ninth

98
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,710
times one over two to the tenth, right?

99
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,460
And we know one over two to the tenth.

100
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,392
Well, you could rewrite right this as two the ninth

101
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:20,850
times two to the negative ten, right?

102
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,101
All I did is I took one over two to the ten and I flipped it

103
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,990
and I made the exponent negative.

104
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,638
And I think you know that already from level two exponents.

105
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,090
And now, once again, we can just add the exponents.

106
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,868
Nine plus negative ten equals two to the negative one,

107
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:41,851
or we could say that equals one half, right?

108
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:44,850
So it's an interesting thing here.

109
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,418
Whatever is the bottom exponent, you could put it in the numerator like we did here,

110
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:50,800
but turn it into a negative,

111
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,852
So that leads us to the second exponent rule,

112
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:59,860
a simplification is we could just say that this equals two to the nine minus ten,

113
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,190
which equals two to the negative one.

114
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,160
Let's do another problem like that.

115
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:16,123
If I said ten to the two hundredth over ten to the fiftieth,

116
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:23,640
well that just equals ten to the two hundred minus fifty, which is one hundred fifty.

117
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:33,855
Likewise, if I had seven to the fortieth power over seven to the negative fifth power,

118
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:41,417
this will equal seven to the fortieth minus negative five.

119
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,230
So it equals seven to the forty-fifth.

120
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,310
Now I want you to think about that, does that make sense?

121
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,388
Well, we could have rewritten this equation as

122
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:59,180
seven to the fortieth times seven to the fifth, right?

123
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,021
We could have taken this one over seven to the negative five and turned it into seven to the fifth,

124
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:08,148
and that would also just be seven to the forty-five.

125
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,379
So the second exponent rule I just taught you actually is no different than that first one.

126
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,272
If the exponent is in the denominator,

127
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:17,241
and of course, it has to be the same base and you're dividing,

128
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:20,570
you subtract it from the exponent in the numerator.

129
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,575
If they're both in the numerator,

130
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:25,811
as in this case: seven to the fortieth times seven to the fifth --

131
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:29,370
actually there's no numerator, but if they're essentially multiplying by each other,

132
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,420
and of course, you have to have the same base--

133
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,690
then you add the exponents.

134
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,285
I'm going to add one variation of this, and actually this is the same thing,

135
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,360
but it's a little bit of a trick question.

136
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:56,470
What is two to the ninth times four to the one hundredth?

137
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,882
Actually, maybe I shouldn't teach this to you.

138
00:08:57,882 --> 00:08:59,480
You'll have to wait until I teach you the next rule.

139
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,900
But I'll give you a little hint.

140
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:09,570
This is the same thing as two the ninth times two squared to the one hundredth.

141
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,812
And the rule I'm going to teach you now is that when you have something to an exponent,

142
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:16,718
and then that number raised to an exponent,

143
00:09:16,718 --> 00:09:18,930
you actually multiply these two exponents.

144
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,980
So this would be two the ninth times two to the two hundredth.

145
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,666
And by that first rule we learned,

146
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,760
this would be two to the two hundred ninth.

147
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,925
Now in the next module I'm going to cover this in more detail.

148
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:34,650
I think I might have just confused you.

149
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,835
But watch the next video

150
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:40,400
and then after the next video I think you're going to be ready to do level one exponent rules.

151
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,545
Have a lot of fun!
