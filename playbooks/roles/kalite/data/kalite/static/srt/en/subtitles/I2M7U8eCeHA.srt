1
00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:08,908
We're in Tate Britain and we're looking at John Everett Millais's Ophelia.

2
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:14,890
This is the quintessential Victorian and quintessential Pre-Raphaelite painting.

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,461
It is. And the Victorians painted Shakespeare quite a lot and they even painted Ophelia quite a lot.

4
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:22,931
But this is the painting that everybody remembers.

5
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:26,453
It's that moment after Hamlet has murdered Ophelia's father,

6
00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:30,520
and she has let herself fall into this river and is letting herself drown.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,436
She goes mad after Hamlet murders her father and allows herself to drown.

8
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:40,884
And Shakespeare describes the place where that happens.

9
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:43,380
He describes the flowers and the willow tree.

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,288
Millais picks up on that interest in the botanical setting and expands on it.

11
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:54,273
On the botanical specificity. This is an artist who is really taking Ruskin seriously.

12
00:00:54,273 --> 00:01:01,939
Ruskin advised artists to go into nature with a "singleness of heart, rejecting nothing, selecting nothing, and scorning nothing."

13
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,787
That is that Nature itself has some kind of spiritual power.

14
00:01:04,787 --> 00:01:08,099
Who are artists to mess with God's work?

15
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:10,205
That's right. But that was the academic tradition,

16
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:13,712
to take from Nature and improve on it and to idealise it.

17
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:18,965
That was what Reynolds had advised, that's the foundation of academic tradition.

18
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:21,857
Millais is completely rejecting that.

19
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:26,021
He's going into nature and he's trying to be as true to what he sees as possible.

20
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:29,010
It's interesting, because when we think of painting in plein air,

21
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,824
that is, when we think of painting outside,

22
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,484
we often think of late 19th century, French painting.

23
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:34,987
We think of the Impressionists, but off course,

24
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:38,903
the Pre-Raphaelites in England were taking this seriously mid-century.

25
00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:42,836
Millais found a spot that was very much like the one that Shakespeare described.

26
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,058
But it's not as pictoresque as it sounds.

27
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:48,723
Painting outside is full of frustrations and difficulties.

28
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:52,526
You have insects, you have weather variations, you have animals,

29
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:56,562
and Millais speaks about this with a wonderful sense of sarcasm in a letter that he wrote.

30
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:57,788
Millais wrote:

31
00:01:57,788 --> 00:02:01,015
"I am threatened with a notice to appear before a magistrate

32
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:03,819
for trespassing in a field and destroying the hay.

33
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:06,837
I am also in danger of being blown by the wind into the water,

34
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:12,354
and becoming intimate with the feelings of Ophelia when that lady sank to muddy death."

35
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:14,534
This is the funniest part, I think.

36
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,497
"There are two swans that not a little add to my misery

37
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:21,666
by persisting in watching me from the exact spot I wish to paint.

38
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:27,594
My sudden perilous evolutions on the extreme bank, to persuade them to evacuate their position,

39
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:30,952
have the effect of entirely deranging my temper,

40
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:33,779
my pictures, brushes and palets.

41
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,689
Certainly, the painting of a picture under such circumstances,

42
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,891
would be a greater punishment for a murderer than a hanging."

43
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:44,945
So we have Millais really clearly at the end of his rope, trying to paint this image.

44
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:49,191
The Pre-Raphaelites often show us images of solitary women,

45
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:55,108
expressing feelings of longing and frustration and, in this case, madness.

46
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,396
The model for this is the woman who'll become Rossetti's wife,

47
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:01,976
who was his model and muse, Elizabeth Siddal.

48
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:05,937
She apparently posed for him in a bathtub they kept warm with some candles underneath.

49
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:09,412
Although she did get sick as the water did eventually get cold.

50
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:12,543
I know he was quite proud of the dress he had bought for her to wear.

51
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:15,858
It was already an antique and was heavily embroidered with silver,

52
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:18,695
and is beautifully rendered here as it floats.

53
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,327
It almost becomes like the water reeds that we see around.

54
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,248
In fact, this painting was really praised in its day

55
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:28,897
for being perhaps the most faithful to nature in terms of its botanical accuracy.

56
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:35,586
We can see clearly not only a large willow tree that has fallen and then has regrown.

57
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:40,557
It's actually wonderful to look at the way that those upturned roots mimic the pose of Ophelia's arms.

58
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:44,972
And we see lots of flowers that we can identify very specifically.

59
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:47,194
And that have symbolic purpose.

60
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:51,873
We see forget-me-nots and poppies, which are a symbol of death,

61
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:55,354
and violets, which are a symbol of faithfulness.

62
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:58,227
In fact, she's got a chain of violets around her neck,

63
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:00,765
which, I think, comes directly from the Shakespearian play.

64
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:05,743
The symbolic meaning of all the flowers would have been understood by the Victorian public.

65
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:08,741
And interestingly, links all the way back to Shakespeare,

66
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:12,231
who, as you said, is very specific as well about some of the flowers that are mentioned.

67
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:15,430
Ophelia floats with her palms upturned.

68
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,044
She's not dead yet, her eyes are open and she seems to be floating down the river.

69
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:23,891
But there are lovely passages when you look closely,

70
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:26,662
not only at the flowers, but especially in the lower left,

71
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:31,845
where we see the light moving through those weeds that are growing up in the water.

72
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:36,670
The intensity of the colors and the specificicity - both of those things, I think,

73
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,403
would have been really new and rather shocking to the Victorian public.

74
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:45,406
Part of that was achieved because the Pre-Raphaelites rejected the traditional mode of painting,

75
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:49,055
that is painting on a dark ground.

76
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:53,707
Instead, they painted on a brilliant white ground and some of that luminosity really comes through.

77
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:59,702
In addition, some of these artists actually painted not on a dry white ground, but on a ground that was still wet,

78
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:05,291
which meant that that white was picked up by the colors and really creates this vivid luminessness.

79
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,941
So the Pre-Raphaelites really were revolutionary.

80
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,465
We love them now and they seem very familiar to us,

81
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:16,383
but they seemed really radical back in the late 1840s and 1850s.
