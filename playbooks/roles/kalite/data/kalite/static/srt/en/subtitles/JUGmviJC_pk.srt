1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,735
Rewrite the following expression as the product of positive exponents, and then evaluate

2
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:08,057
the expression when x=2.

3
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:11,494
So they give us x to the negative 3 times 5 to the negative 2 times

4
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:12,655
x squared.

5
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:17,067
So the main thing to realize here is if I had something to a negative

6
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:23,893
exponent, this is the exact same thing as 1 over that same base,

7
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:25,800
to the positive version of the exponent.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,667
So x to the negative a is equal to 1 over x to the a.

9
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,974
So using this knowledge just supply it over here.

10
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:34,064
So x to the negative 3,

11
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:34,992
power,

12
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:38,661
We can rewrite as 1 over x to the third power.

13
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:45,070
And then 5 to the negative 2, we can rewrite as 1 over 5 squared.

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,993
And then finally we have times x squared.

15
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:54,311
So we can multiply this out and the numerator we have 1 times 1 times x squared.

16
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:56,401
Which is just equal to x squared.

17
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:59,600
And the denominator we have x to the third times 5 squared.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,086
5 squared is 25, and here you could say implicit there is a 1.

19
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:07,333
This is the same thing as x squared over 1.

20
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,658
So the denominator we have 25 times x to the third.

21
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:15,400
So this is going to be 25, times x to the third.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,739
And then we can simplify this even more because

23
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:21,067
both the numerator and the denominator is divisible by x squared.

24
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,894
x squared divided by x squared is 1.

25
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:29,931
x to the third divided by x squared is just going to be equal to x.

26
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:31,045
And you can use other exponent properties

27
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:34,733
you can say x squared over x to the third is the same thing as

28
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:38,708
x to the 2 minus 3 power which is x to the negative 1 power,

29
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:42,667
But x to the negative 1 power we know it is the same thing as 1 over

30
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:43,398
x.

31
00:01:43,398 --> 00:01:47,200
Any way you do it as long you do it any reasonable way,

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,714
you should get the same result.

33
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:50,643
So when we simplify it,

34
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:55,055
we get 1 over 25 x.

35
00:01:55,055 --> 00:02:00,667
Now, they want us to evaluate it when x=2.

36
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:05,597
So if x is equal to 2, we get 1 over 25 times 2 which is equal to 1

37
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,386
over

38
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:08,067
50. And we are done.

39
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:11,913
We rewrote the expression as a product of positive exponents.

40
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:13,000
That's right over here.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,235
We made all the exponents positive.

42
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,022
And then we evaluate it.

43
00:02:16,022 --> 99:59:59,999
We got 1 over 50.
