1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
two positive integers differ by 60.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The sum of their square roots is the square root of an integer

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is not a perfect square.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the maximum possible sum of the two integers?

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the second sentence is a little confusing.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lets take it step by step.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so two possitive integers differ by 60.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets say we have a and b.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have A and B they are both greater than zero

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so they are both integers

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they differ by 60 so

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A minus B is equal to 60

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or we could add B to both sides and we get A

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to b plus 60

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they are 60 apart fair enough

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now this second sentence

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the sum of their square roots so the

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sum of their square roots.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
squared of A plus squared to B

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The sum of their square roots is the square root of an integer

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is not a perfect square.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so its equal to the square of sum integer

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so c is an integer c is an integer but its not a

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
perfect square. square root of c not is not an integer

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is maximum possible sum of the two integers.
