1
00:00:00,272 --> 00:00:06,597
solve for x. we have x-8=x/3 +1/6.

2
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:08,800
Now the first thing I want to do here

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,300
There is multiple ways to do this problem,

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,816
What I am gonna do is to simplify the fractions.

5
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:17,972
I am going to multiply everything times the least common multiple of all

6
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:19,667
of these guys denominator.

7
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,014
This is essentially,

8
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:22,407
x over 1, this is 8 over1,

9
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:22,907
x over 3,

10
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:23,591
1 over 6

11
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:27,376
The least common multiple of 1, 3 and 6 is 6.

12
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:30,766
So if I multiply everything times 6,

13
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:33,267
it's going to clear out these fractions.

14
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,132
so, these weren't fractions to begin with

15
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:36,757
So just multiplying them by 6,

16
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:42,626
so it becomes 6x minus 6 times negative 8 or 6 times 8 is 48

17
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,767
and there is , we are subtracting it right over there,

18
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:49,825
And then we have x over 3 times 6, let me just write out here

19
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:53,418
So that's going to be 6 times x over 3, plus,

20
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:55,687
6 times 1 over 6 .

21
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:59,884
Or we get, 6x minus 48 is equal to

22
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:02,692
6 times something divided by 3,

23
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:05,550
that's the same thing as 6 divided by 3 times that something

24
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,381
that's just going to be equal to 2x plus

25
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:14,188
6 times one-sixth or 6 divide by 6 is just going to be 1

26
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:16,591
So that first step cleared out all of the fractions

27
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:18,875
and now this is just a straight- forward problem

28
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,982
with all integer co-efficients or integers on

29
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,848
either side of the equation.

30
00:01:22,848 --> 00:01:25,380
What we wanna do is, we wanna isolate all of the x

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,109
on one side or the other.

32
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,931
we might as well isolate them all on the left hand side

33
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:32,346
So,lets subtract 2x from both sides,

34
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:33,727
we want to get rid of this 2x here.

35
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,736
That's why I am subtracting the 2x.

36
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:40,333
So let's subtract 2x from both sides, and,

37
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,699
on the right hand side, I have 2x plus 1 minus 2x

38
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:45,867
those cancelled out.

39
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:46,764
That was the whole point

40
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:47,648
So , I'm left with just

41
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:49,830
this 1 over here

42
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,711
On the left hand side, I have 6x minus 2x ,

43
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,033
Well, that's just going to be 4x if I

44
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:55,467
have 6x of something minus 2 of that something,

45
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:56,912
I have 4 of that something.

46
00:01:56,912 --> 00:02:02,346
minus 48. And now I can.. lets see I want to get rid of

47
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:05,415
this 48 on the left hand side, I want only x here.

48
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:08,755
So let me add 48 to both sides of the equation.

49
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,984
this in a new color! So let me add 48

50
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:16,696
to both sides of this equation.

51
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:18,809
And on the left hand side, 4x minus 48 plus 48

52
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:21,456
those cancelled out, I am left with just a 4x

53
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:25,055
And on the right hand side, 1 plus 48 is going to be

54
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,191
49. And now I have isolated the x,

55
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:31,046
but still multiplied by a 4 so to make that

56
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:33,832
a 1 co-efficent, lets multiply both sides by one-fourth

57
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,411
or you can also that

58
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:36,933
lets divide both sides by 4.

59
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:41,170
Anything you do the one side , you have to do to the other

60
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,817
And so you have.. What do we have over here,

61
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:46,023
4x over 4 is just x,

62
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:48,559
x is equal to 49 over 4.

63
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:51,688
That's about as far as we can simplify it

64
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:55,334
because these don't have any common factors, 49 and 4.

65
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:58,956
Lets check to see whether 49 by 4 is indeed the answer.

66
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:01,116
So, let us put it into the original equation

67
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:03,467
well the original equation is what we have in green here.

68
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:04,916
before we multiplied it,

69
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,897
before we multiplied by 6.

70
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:09,916
But in theory we should be able to put it into any of these steps

71
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,681
and x should satisfy it.

72
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,977
Lets do it in our original equation.

73
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:15,651
So we have x minus 8, so we have

74
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:19,250
49 over 4 minus 8 should be

75
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:27,150
equal to 49 over 4 over 3 plus 1 over 6.

76
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,278
So lets see what we can do here, so what we can..

77
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:34,622
lets see.. we can multiply, well like we did before.

78
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:37,176
We can multiply both sides of this equation by 6,

79
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,916
that will help simplify a lot of the fractions

80
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,981
here. So if we multiply both sides of this equation

81
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:45,907
by 6, so we are going to multiply everything

82
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:50,272
.. everything by 6.

83
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,294
what do we get,

84
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:55,164
On the left hand side , 6 over 4 is the same thing as 3 over 2

85
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:59,003
So this is going to be 3 times 49 over 2,

86
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:03,740
3 times 49 over 2 minus 48

87
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,991
will be equal to

88
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:08,941
6 divided by 3 is going to be 2, so its

89
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:11,779
2 times 49 over 4 , which is the same thing as

90
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:18,229
49 over 2 , and then 6 times one-sixth is plus 1

91
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:23,198
and lets see , we can, well I am just going to, I am just going to

92
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:25,451
actually just evaluate them out. I could just essentially have to

93
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:28,678
you know subtract 49 over 2 from both sides, that will simplify

94
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:32,224
things, but let me just, let me just figure out what these

95
00:04:32,224 --> 00:04:36,248
evaluate to. So 3 times 49, 49 times 3

96
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:39,963
you could think about it's going to be 3 less than 50 times 3

97
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:44,333
so its 147. But less just multiply out 9 times 3 is 27,

98
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:49,333
4 times 3 is 12, plus 2, is 14. So 147.

99
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:53,222
This is 147 over 2.

100
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:55,358
and then lets put this over a denominator of 2.

101
00:04:55,358 --> 00:05:00,629
So 48 is equal to 96 over 2, right

102
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:03,972
96 divide by 2 is 48. I just multiplied this by 2.

103
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:08,524
So this is minus 96 over 2, needs to be equal to

104
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:12,332
49 over 2 plus, and instead of having this 1,

105
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:14,127
lets write that as 2 over 2.

106
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:18,333
Now what is 47 minus 96.

107
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,271
So 47 minus a hundred would be,

108
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:24,847
147 minus a 100 would be 47,

109
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:27,200
we are going to subtract 4 more than that.

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,675
So we are going to have, it's going to be..oh sorry!

111
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:31,175
We are going to subtract 4 less than a 100

112
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:36,341
So it's going to be 147 minus 96 is going to be 51,

113
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:43,632
51 over 2 is equal to 49 plus 2 is 51 over 2.

114
00:05:43,632 --> 99:59:59,999
so it all checks out.
