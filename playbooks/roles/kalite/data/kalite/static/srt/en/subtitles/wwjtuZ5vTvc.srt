1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,240
Let's say that I have some
object, and when it's outside

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:12,970
of water, its weight
is 10 newtons.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,850
When I submerge it in water-- I
put it on a weighing machine

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:26,690
in water-- its weight
is 2 newtons.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,440
What must be going on here?

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,670
The water must be exerting some
type of upward force to

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,640
counteract at least
8 newtons of the

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,890
object's original weight.

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:43,460
   

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,450
That difference is the
buoyant force.

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,600
So the way to think about is
that once you put the object

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,630
in the water-- it could be a
cube, or it could be anything.

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:01:00,170
   

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:08,540
We know that we have a downward
weight that is 10

16
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,230
newtons, but we know that once
it's in the water, the net

17
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,070
weight is 2 newtons, so there
must be some force acting

18
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,460
upwards on the object
of 8 newtons.

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,620
That's the buoyant force that
we learned about in the

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,250
previous video, in the video
about Archimedes' principle.

21
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,380
This is the buoyant force.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,040
   

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:38,320
So the buoyant force is equal
to 10 minus 2 is equal to 8.

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,140
That's how much the water's
pushing up.

25
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,350
And what does that
also equal to?

26
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:49,520
That equals the weight of the
water displaced, so 8 newtons

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,780
is equal to weight of
water displaced.

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,990
What is the weight of
the water displaced?

29
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,510
That's the volume of the water
displaced times the density of

30
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,460
water times gravity.

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,350
What is the volume of
water displaced?

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,910
It's just the volume of water,
divide 8 newtons by the

33
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,130
density of water,
which is 1,000

34
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,790
kilograms per meter cubed.

35
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:28,930
A newton is 1 kilogram meter
per second squared.

36
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,770
   

37
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,450
Then, what's gravity?

38
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:39,730
It's 9.8 meters per
second squared.

39
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,820
If we look at all the units,
they actually do turn out with

40
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,430
you just ending up having
just meters cubed, but

41
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,470
let's do the math.

42
00:02:46,470 --> 00:03:03,870
We get 8 divided by 1,000
divided by 9.8 is equal to 8.2

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,510
times 10 to the negative 4.

44
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:16,650
V equals 8.2 times 10 to the
minus 4 cubic meters.

45
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,420
Just knowing the difference in
the weight of an object-- the

46
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,760
difference when I put
it in water-- I can

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,710
figure out the volume.

48
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,340
This could be a fun game
to do next time your

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,670
friends come over.

50
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,970
Weigh yourself outside of water,
then get some type of

51
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,700
spring or waterproof weighing
machine, put it at the bottom

52
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,965
of your pool, stand on it, and
figure out what your weight

53
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:41,490
is, assuming that you're dense
enough to go all the

54
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,150
way into the water.

55
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,330
You could figure out somehow
your weight in water, and then

56
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,390
you would know your volume.

57
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,940
There's other ways.

58
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,170
You could just figure out how
much the surface of the water

59
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,850
increases, and take
that water away.

60
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,630
This was interesting.

61
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,760
Just knowing how much the
buoyant force of the water was

62
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,610
or how much lighter we are when
the object goes into the

63
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,800
water, we can figure out the
volume of the object.

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,880
This might seem like a very
small volume, but just keep in

65
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:17,100
mind in a meter cubed, you
have 27 square feet.

66
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:28,020
If we multiply that number
times 27, it equals 0.02

67
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,650
square feet roughly.

68
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,280
In 0.02 square feet, how many--
in a square foot,

69
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,210
there's actually-- 12 to the
third power times 12 times 12

70
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:47,630
is equal to 1,728 times 0.02.

71
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,060
So this is actually
34 square inches.

72
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,560
The object isn't as small as you
may have thought it to be.

73
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,280
It's actually maybe a little bit
bigger than 3 inches by 3

74
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,500
inches by 3 inches, so it's
a reasonably sized object.

75
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,840
Anyway, let's do another
problem.

76
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,280
   

77
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,840
Let's say I have some balsa
wood, and I know that the

78
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,780
density of balsa wood is 130
kilograms per meter cubed.

79
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,330
   

80
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,440
I have some big cube of balsa
wood, and what I want to know

81
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,040
is if I put that-- let
me draw the water.

82
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,400
I have some big cube of balsa
wood, which I'll do in brown.

83
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,570
So I have a big cube of balsa
wood and the water should go

84
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,910
on top of it, just so
that you see it's

85
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,410
submerged in the water.

86
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,640
I want to know what percentage
of the cube goes below the

87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,590
surface of the water?

88
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,160
Interesting question.

89
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,790
So how do we do that?

90
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,625
For the object to be at rest,
for this big cube to be at

91
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:02,080
rest, there must be zero net
forces on this object.

92
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,140
In that situation, the buoyant
force must completely equal

93
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,510
the weight or the force
of gravity.

94
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,550
What's the force of gravity
going to be?

95
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,130
The force of gravity is just the
weight of the object, and

96
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:27,110
that's the volume of the balsa
wood times the density of the

97
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,950
balsa wood times gravity.

98
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,130
What's the buoyant force?

99
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,960
The buoyant force is equal to
the volume of the displaced

100
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,090
water, but that's also the
volume of the displaced water

101
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,200
and it's the volume of the cube
that's been submerged.

102
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,170
The part of the cube that's
submerged, that's volume.

103
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,400
That's also equal
to the amount of

104
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,690
volume of water displaced.

105
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,970
We could say that's the volume
of the block submerged, which

106
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,330
is the same thing, remember,
as the volume of the water

107
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,300
displaced times the density
of water times gravity.

108
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,820
Remember, this is density
of water.

109
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,880
So remember, the buoyant force
is just equal to the weight of

110
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,000
the water displaced and that's
just the volume of the water

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,230
displaced times the density
of water times gravity.

112
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,560
Of course, the volume of the
water displaced is the exact

113
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,710
same thing as the volume
of the block

114
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,850
that's actually submerged.

115
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,710
Since the block is stationary,
it's not accelerating upwards

116
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,490
or downwards, we know that
these two quantities must

117
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,900
equal each other.

118
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,340
So V, the volume of the wood,
the entire volume, not just

119
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,210
the amount that's submerged,
times the density of the wood

120
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,450
times gravity must equal the
volume of the wood submerged,

121
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,610
which is equal to the volume of
the water displaced times

122
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,580
the density of water
times gravity.

123
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,890
We have the acceleration
of gravity.

124
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,140
We have that on both sides,
so we can cross it out.

125
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,400
Let me switch colors to
ease the monotony.

126
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,130
   

127
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:07,360
What happens if we divide both
sides by the volume of the

128
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,610
balsa wood?

129
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,130
   

130
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,050
I'm just rearranging
this equation.

131
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,850
I think you'll figure it out.

132
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,300
We divide both sides by that,
and you get the volume

133
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,080
submerged divided by the volume
of the balsa wood-- I

134
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,450
just divided both sides by VB
and switched sides-- is equal

135
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:35,590
to the density of the balsa
wood divided by

136
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,970
the density of water.

137
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,549
Does that make sense?

138
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:43,140
I just did a couple of quick
algebraic operations, but

139
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,100
hopefully that got rid of
the g, and that should

140
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,200
make sense to you.

141
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,270
Now we're ready to solve
our problem.

142
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,520
My original question is
what percentage of

143
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,450
the object is submerged?

144
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,160
That's exactly this number.

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,530
If we say this is the volume
submerged over the total

146
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,450
volume, this is the
percent submerged.

147
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,030
That equals the density of
balsa wood, which is 130

148
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,550
kilograms per meter cubed,
divided by the density of

149
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,940
water, which is 1,000 kilograms
per meter cubed, so

150
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,180
130 divided by 1,000 is 0.13.

151
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,370
Vs over VB is equal to
0.13, which is the

152
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,370
same thing as 13%.

153
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,730
So, exactly 13% percent of this
balsa wood block will be

154
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,140
submerged in the water.

155
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,660
That's pretty neat to me.

156
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,470
