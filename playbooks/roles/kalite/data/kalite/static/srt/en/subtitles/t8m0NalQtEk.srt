1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,558
Let's start with a warm-up problem

2
00:00:02,558 --> 00:00:06,132
to avoid getting any mental cramps as we learn new things.

3
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:06,967
So this is a problem

4
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:09,862
that hopefully, if you understood what we did in the last video,

5
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:12,800
you can kind of understand what we're about to do right now.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,310
And I'm going to escalate it even more.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,211
In the last video,

8
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:19,405
I think we finished with a four-digit number times a one-digit number.

9
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:23,208
Let's up the stakes to a five-digit number.

10
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:33,645
Let's do sixty-four thousand three hundred twenty-nine

11
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:37,222
times-- let me think of a nice number.

12
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:40,992
Times four.

13
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:41,934
I'm going to show you right now

14
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:44,730
that we're going to do the exact same process that we did in the last video.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,250
We just have to do it a little bit longer than we did before.

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,090
So we just start off saying, okay, what's four times nine?

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,237
Four times nine is equal to thirty-six.

18
00:00:56,237 --> 00:00:57,400
Right? Eighteen times two.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,410
Yep, thirty-six.

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,270
So we write the six down here, carry the three up there.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,825
Just put the three up there, then you got four times two.

22
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:09,401
Four times two.

23
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:10,947
And they're going to have to add the three.

24
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:12,100
So let me just write that there.

25
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,672
Plus three is equal to-- you do the multiplication first.

26
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:18,211
You can even think of it as order of operations,

27
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,040
but you just should know that you do the multiplication first.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,300
So four times two is eight.

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,020
Plus three is equal to eleven.

30
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,370
Put this one down here and put the one ten and eleven up there.

31
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,316
Then you got four times three.

32
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:39,063
Four times three.

33
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:39,871
You got that one up there,

34
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,545
so you're going to have to add that plus one is equal to--

35
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:44,297
that's going to equal twelve plus one,

36
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:46,740
which is equal to thirteen.

37
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,120
So it's thirteen.

38
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,165
Then you have four times four.

39
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:56,556
Four times four.

40
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:58,055
You have this little one hanging out here

41
00:01:58,055 --> 00:01:59,640
from the previous multiplications,

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,840
so you're going to have to add that.

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,050
And that's equal to sixteen plus one.

44
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,310
It's equal to seventeen.

45
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,680
Stick the seven down here, put the one up there.

46
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,030
We're almost done.

47
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,388
And then we have four times six.

48
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:18,427
Four times six,

49
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:21,665
plus one.

50
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:22,300
What is that?

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,740
Four times six is twenty-four.

52
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,920
Plus one is twenty-five.

53
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,330
Put the five down here.

54
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,620
There's no where to put the two--

55
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,836
there's no more multiplications to do--

56
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:33,670
so we just put the two down there.

57
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,561
So sixty-four thousand three hundred twenty-nine times four

58
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:44,839
is two hundred fifty-seven thousand three hundred sixteen.

59
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:47,640
And in case you're wondering, these commas don't mean much.

60
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,450
They just help me read the number.

61
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,456
So I put it after every three digits,

62
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:54,584
so I know that for example, that everything after this is in the thousands.

63
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:55,624
This is seven thousand.

64
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:57,910
If I had another comma here, then I'd know that this is millions.

65
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,040
So it just helps me read the problem a bit.

66
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,299
So if you got that,

67
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:06,922
you're now ready to escalate to a slightly more complicated situation.

68
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:09,650
Although the first way that we're going to do it

69
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,270
is actually not going to look any more complicated.

70
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,780
It's just going to involve one more step.

71
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,392
So everything we've done so far

72
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:18,080
are a bunch of digits times a one-digit number.

73
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,900
Now let's do a bunch of digits times a two-digit number.

74
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,286
So let's say we want to multiply thirty-six times--

75
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:29,695
instead of putting a one-digit number here,

76
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:31,120
I'm going to put a two-digit number.

77
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,690
So times twenty-three.

78
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,536
So you start off doing this problem

79
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:40,240
exactly the way you would have done it if there was just a three down here.

80
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,180
You can kind of ignore the two for a little bit.

81
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,260
So three times six is equal to eighteen.

82
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,060
So you just put the eight here, put the ten there, or the one there

83
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,870
because it's ten plus eight.

84
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,150
Three times three is nine.

85
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,230
Plus one, so three times three plus one is equal to--

86
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,090
that's nine plus one is equal to ten.

87
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,070
So you put the ten there.

88
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,190
There's nothing left.

89
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,050
You put the zero there.

90
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,690
There's nothing left to put the one over, so you put the ten there.

91
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,290
So you essentially have solved the problem that thirty-six--

92
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,920
let me do this is another color--

93
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,490
That thirty-six times three is equal to one hundred eight.

94
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,052
That's what we've solved so far,

95
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:27,360
but we have this twenty sitting out here.

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,100
We have this twenty.

97
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,940
We have to figure out what twenty times three hundred sixty is.

98
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,285
Or sorry, what twenty times thirty-six is.

99
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:36,650
So what you do to multiply-- this two is really a twenty.

100
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,192
And to make it all work out like that,

101
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:42,190
what we do is we throw a zero down here.

102
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,170
We throw a zero right there.

103
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,699
In a second I'm going to explain why exactly we did that.

104
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,451
So let's just do the same process

105
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:51,270
as we did before with the three.

106
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,450
Now we do it with a two, but we start filling up here

107
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,100
and move to the left.

108
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,762
So two times six.

109
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:59,415
Two times six.

110
00:04:59,415 --> 00:04:59,977
That's easy.

111
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,630
That's twelve.

112
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,440
So two times six is twelve.

113
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,360
We put the one up here and we have to be very careful

114
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,022
because we had this one from our previous problem,

115
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:11,440
which doesn't apply anymore.

116
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,200
So we could erase it or that one we could get rid of.

117
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,385
If you have an eraser get rid of it,

118
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,779
or you can just keep track in your head

119
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:20,120
that the one you're about to write is a different one.

120
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,430
So what were we doing?

121
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,960
We wrote two times six is twelve.

122
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,060
Put the two here.

123
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,440
Put the one up here.

124
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,862
And I got rid of the previous one

125
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,620
because that would've just messed me up.

126
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,150
Now I have two times three.

127
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,610
Two times three is equal to six.

128
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,020
But then I have this plus one up here, so I have to add plus one.

129
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,540
So I get seven.

130
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,550
So that is equal to seven.

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,430
Two times three plus one is equal to seven.

132
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,240
So this seven hundred twenty we just solved, that's literally--

133
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,100
let me write that down.

134
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,700
What is that?

135
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,900
That is thirty-six times twenty.

136
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,090
Thirty-six times twenty is equal to seven hundred twenty.

137
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,355
And hopefully that should explain

138
00:06:03,355 --> 00:06:05,470
why we had to throw this zero here.

139
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,380
If we didn't throw that zero here we would have just a two--

140
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,800
we would just have a seventy-two here, instead of seven hundred twenty.

141
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,630
And seventy-two is thirty-six times two.

142
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,980
But this isn't a two.

143
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,920
This is a two in the tens place.

144
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,100
This is a twenty.

145
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,260
So we have to multiply thirty-six times twenty,

146
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,130
and that's why we got seven hundred twenty there.

147
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,800
So thirty-six times twenty-three.

148
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,959
Let's write it this way.

149
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,550
Let me get some space up here.

150
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,745
So we could write thirty--

151
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:35,252
well, actually, let me just finish the problem

152
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:38,398
and then I'll explain to you why it worked.

153
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,375
So now, to finish it up we just add one hundred eight to seven hundred twenty.

154
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,383
So eight plus zero is eight.

155
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,175
Zero plus two is two.

156
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:48,640
One plus seven is eight.

157
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,340
So thirty-six times twenty-three is eight hundred twenty-eight.

158
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,730
Now you're saying, Sal, why did that work?

159
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,520
Why were we able to figure out separately that thirty-six times three

160
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,211
is equal to one hundred eight,

161
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,971
and then thirty-six times twenty is equal to seven hundred twenty,

162
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:06,100
and then add them up like that?

163
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,330
Because we could have rewritten the problem like this.

164
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,660
We could have rewritten the problem as thirty-six--

165
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,310
the original problem was this.

166
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,750
We could have rewritten this as thirty-six times twenty plus three.

167
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,365
And this, and I don't know if you've learned the distributive property yet,

168
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:28,140
but this is just the distributive property.

169
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:34,666
This is just the same thing as thirty-six times twenty

170
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:38,634
plus thirty-six times three.

171
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,710
If that confuses you, then you don't have to worry about it.

172
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,884
But if it doesn't, then this is good.

173
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,320
It's actually teaching you something.

174
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,440
Thirty-six times twenty we saw was seven hundred twenty.

175
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,023
We learned that thirty-six times three was one hundred eight.

176
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:52,440
And when you added them together we got what?

177
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,130
Eight hundred twenty-eight?

178
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,710
Is that what we got?

179
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,310
We got eight hundred twenty-eight.

180
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,722
And you could expand it even more

181
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,010
like we did in the previous video.

182
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:07,000
You could write this out as thirty plus six times twenty plus three.

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,950
Actually, let me just do it that way,

184
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,100
because I think that could help you out a little bit.

185
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,780
If it confuses you, ignore it.

186
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,720
If it doesn't, that's good.

187
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,150
So we could do three times six.

188
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,560
Three times six is eighteen.

189
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,430
Eighteen is just ten plus eight.

190
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,660
So it's eight, then we put a ten up here.

191
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,480
And ignore all this up here.

192
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,440
Three times thirty.

193
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,560
Three times thirty is ninety.

194
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,880
Ninety plus ten is one hundred.

195
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,890
So one hundred is zero tens plus one hundred.

196
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,500
I don't know if this confuses you or not.

197
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,740
If it does, ignore it.

198
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,150
If it doesn't, well I don't want to complicate the issue.

199
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,410
And now we can multiply twenty.

200
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,100
We can ignore this thing that we had before.

201
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,670
Twenty times six is one hundred twenty.

202
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,940
So that's twenty plus one hundred.

203
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,030
So I'll put that one hundred up here.

204
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,152
Twenty times thirty-- you might not know--

205
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:10,550
is two times three and you have two zeros there.

206
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,918
And I think I'm maybe jumping the gun a little bit,

207
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:16,230
assuming a little bit too much of what you may or may not know.

208
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,000
But twenty times thirty is going to be six hundred.

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,340
And you add another hundred there, that's seven hundred.

210
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,480
And then you add them all up.

211
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,960
You get eight hundred.

212
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,470
One hundred plus seven hundred.

213
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,510
Plus twenty plus eight, which is equal to eight hundred twenty-eight.

214
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,850
My point here is to show you why that system we did worked.

215
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,110
Why we added a zero here to begin with.

216
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,330
But if it confuses you, don't worry about that right now.

217
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,550
Learn how to do it and then maybe re-watch this video.

218
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,155
Let's just do a bunch more examples,

219
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:47,229
because I think the examples

220
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:50,230
are what really, hopefully, explain the situation.

221
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
So let's do seventy-seven.

222
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:52,900
Let's do a fun one.

223
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,930
Seventy-seven times seventy-seven.

224
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,113
Seven times seven is forty-nine.

225
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:04,211
Put the four up here.

226
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:06,346
Seven times seven, well, that's forty-nine.

227
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:10,250
Plus four is fifty-three.

228
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,180
There's no where to put the five, so we put it down here.

229
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,970
Seven times seven is forty-nine.

230
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,600
Plus four is fifty-three.

231
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,670
Stick a zero here.

232
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,340
Now we're going to do this seven.

233
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,900
So stick a zero here.

234
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,014
Let's get rid of this right there

235
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:24,330
because that'll just mess us up.

236
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,460
Seven times seven is forty-nine.

237
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,120
Stick a nine there.

238
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,650
Put a four there.

239
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,130
Seven times seven is forty-nine.

240
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,225
Plus four, which is fifty-three.

241
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:40,886
So notice, when we multiplied seven times seventy-seven we got five hundred thirty-nine.

242
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:46,244
When we multiplied seventy times seventy-seven we got five thousand three hundred ninety.

243
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:46,870
And it makes sense.

244
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,740
They just differ by a zero.

245
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,620
By a factor of ten.

246
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,180
And now we can just add them up, and what do we get?

247
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,050
Nine plus zero is nine.

248
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,940
Three plus nine is twelve.

249
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,350
Carry the one.

250
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,040
One plus five is six.

251
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,854
Six plus three is nine.

252
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,031
And then we have this five.

253
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:14,531
So it's five thousand nine hundred twenty-nine.
