1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
I figure it never hurts getting
as much practice as

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,010
possible solving systems of
linear equations, so let's

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,770
solve this one.

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,930
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to solve it using an

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,310
augmented matrix, and I'm going
to put it in reduced row

7
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,130
echelon form.

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,940
So what's the augmented matrix
for this system of equations?

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,405
Three unknowns with
three equations.

10
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:22,720
   

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,990
I just have to do
the coefficents.

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,010
So the coefficients of x
terms are just 1, 1, 1.

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,590
Coefficients of the y terms
are 1, 2, and 3.

14
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,920
Coefficients of the z terms
are 1, 3, and 4.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,340
   

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,280
And let me show that
it's augmented.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,030
And then they equal
3, 0, and minus 2.

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,330
Now, I want to get this
augmented matrix into reduced

19
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,570
row echelon form.

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,840
So the first thing, I have
a leading 1 here

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,240
that's a pivot entry.

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,550
Let me make everything else in
that column equal to a 0.

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,320
So I'm not going to change
my first row.

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,740
So it will just be a 1, a 1, a
1, and then my dividing line,

25
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,450
and then I have a 3.

26
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,770
Now, to zero this out, let me
just replace the second row

27
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,670
with the first row minus
the second row.

28
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,580
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,170
1 minus 2 is-- actually, a
better thing to do, because I

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,670
eventually want this to be 1
anyway, let me replace this

31
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,230
row with this row, with the
second row minus the first row

32
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,620
instead of the first row
minus the second row.

33
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,910
I can do it either way.

34
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,220
So the second row minus
the first row.

35
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,760
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,230
2 minus 1 is 1.

37
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,510
3 minus 1 is 2.

38
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,930
And then 0 minus 3 is minus 3.

39
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,550
Now I want to also
zero this out.

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,220
So let me replace this
guy with this

41
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,200
equation minus that equation.

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,170
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

43
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,800
3 minus 1 is 2.

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,910
4 minus 1 is 3.

45
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,860
Minus 2 minus 3 is minus 5.

46
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,490
Fair enough.

47
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,900
So I got my pivot entry here.

48
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,200
I have another pivot
entry here.

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,710
It's to the right of this one,
which is what I want for

50
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,460
reduced row echelon form.

51
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,710
Now, I need to target this
entry and that entry.

52
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,960
I need to zero them out.

53
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,500
So let's do it.

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,800
So I'm going to keep my
second row the same.

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,720
My second row is 0, 1, 2, and
then I have a minus 3, the

56
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,650
augmented part of it.

57
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,420
And to zero this guy out, what
I can do is I can replace the

58
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,640
first row with the first row
minus the second row.

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,770
So I get 1 minus 0 is 1.

60
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,700
1 minus 1-- there's
a bird outside.

61
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,720
Let me close my window.

62
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,280
So where was I?

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,410
I'm replacing the first row with
the first row minus the

64
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,050
second row.

65
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,800
So 1 minus 0 is 1.

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,240
1 minus 1 is 0.

67
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,140
   

68
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,780
1 minus 2 is minus 1.

69
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,130
And then 3 minus minus 3, so
that's equal to 3 plus 3, so

70
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,340
that's equal to 6.

71
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,680
1 minus 0 is 1.

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,510
1 minus 1 is 0, negative 1.

73
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,930
And then 3 minus negative
3, that's 6.

74
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,390
I always want to make sure I
don't make a careless mistake.

75
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,230
Now, let me get rid of this
entry right here.

76
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,590
Let me zero that out.

77
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,780
So let me replace the third row
with the third row minus 2

78
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,880
times the second row.

79
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,980
So we have 0 minus--
well, 2 times 0.

80
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,760
That's just going to be 0.

81
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,790
2 minus 2 times 1, that's
2 minus 2, that's 0.

82
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,980
3 minus 2 times 2, that's
3 minus 4, or minus 1.

83
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,130
And then finally, minus 5
minus 2 times minus 3.

84
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,380
Let me write that down.

85
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,120
   

86
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,390
That's minus 5, minus minus 6.

87
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,089
That's minus 5 plus
6 is equal to 1.

88
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,680
I really wanted to make
sure I didn't make a

89
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,220
careless mistake there.

90
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,110
So that is equal to 1.

91
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,540
So I'm almost done, but I'm
still not in reduced row

92
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,760
echelon form.

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,260
This has to be a positive
1 in order to get there.

94
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,670
It can't be anything
other than a 1.

95
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,980
That's just the style of reduced
row echelon form.

96
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,390
And then these guys up here
have to be zeroed out.

97
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,990
Well, the easy thing to do,
let me just multiply this

98
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,130
equation by minus 1.

99
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,490
So then this becomes a plus 1
and that becomes a minus 1.

100
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,120
And then I just need to zero
out these two guys up here.

101
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,810
So let's do it.

102
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,980
So my equation, I'm going to
keep my third row the same.

103
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,410
My third row is now
0, 0, 1, minus 1.

104
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,530
   

105
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,330
And now I want to zero
this guy out.

106
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,420
So what I can do is I could set
my first row equal to my

107
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,970
first row plus my last row,
because if these two add up,

108
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,730
they're going to
be equal to 0.

109
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,580
So what do I get?

110
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,590
1 plus 0 is 1.

111
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,680
0 plus 0 is 0.

112
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,050
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

113
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,390
6 plus minus 1 is 5.

114
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,300
Now, I want to zero
this row out.

115
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,560
And to zero this row out, what
I can do is I'll replace it

116
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,490
with the second row minus
2 times the first row.

117
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,580
So 0 minus 2 times
0 is just 0.

118
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,990
1 minus 2 times 0 is just 1.

119
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,320
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

120
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,180
Minus 3 minus 2 times
negative 1.

121
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,040
Let me write that down.

122
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,060
Minus 3 minus 2 times minus 1.

123
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,960
I don't want to make
a careless mistake.

124
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,070
So what is that equal to?

125
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:14,390
This is equal to minus 3 minus
minus 2, or minus 3 plus 2,

126
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,790
which is equal to minus 1.

127
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,830
So that's equal to minus 1.

128
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,220
And now I have my augmented
matrix in

129
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,990
reduced row echelon form.

130
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:30,070
   

131
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,290
My pivot entries are the only
entries in their columns.

132
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,690
Each pivot entry in each
successive row is to the right

133
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,190
of the pivot entry before it.

134
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,040
And actually, I have
no free variables.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,000
Every column has
a pivot entry.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,780
So let's go back from the
augmented matrix world and

137
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,550
kind of put back our
variables there.

138
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,440
So what do we get?

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:59,980
We get x plus 0y plus
0z is equal to 5.

140
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,050
That's that row right there.

141
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:10,230
We get 0x plus 1y plus 0z
is equal to minus 1.

142
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,260
That's that row right there.

143
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:18,000
And then finally, we have
0x plus 0y plus 1z is

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,740
equal to minus 1.

145
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,590
That's that row right there.

146
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,510
And just like that, we've
actually solved our system of

147
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,600
three equations with
three unknowns.

148
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,570
That's the solution
right there.

149
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,570
I just wrote it in this way
just so you can see the

150
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,610
corresponding, but obviously,
I could have written them

151
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,875
closer to their equal sign.

152
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,260
So hopefully, you found
that vaguely useful.

153
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,855
