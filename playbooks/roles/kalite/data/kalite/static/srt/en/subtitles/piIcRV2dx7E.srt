1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,360
Now that we've got the basics
of order of operations out of

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,100
the way, let's try to tackle a
really hairy and

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,240
beastly problem.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,990
So here, we have all
sorts of parentheses and

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,340
numbers flying around.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,190
But in any of these order of
operations problems, you really

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,650
just have to take a deep breath
and remember, we're going

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,870
to do parentheses first.

9
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,810
Parentheses.

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,820
P for parentheses.

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,760
Then exponents.

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,330
Don't worry if you don't know
what exponents are, because

13
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,910
this has no exponents in them.

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,930
Then you're going to do
multiplication and division.

15
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,220
They're at the same level.

16
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,980
Then you do addition
and subtraction.

17
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,330
So some people remember PEMDAS.

18
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,640
But if you remember PEMDAS,
remember multiplication,

19
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,900
division, same level.

20
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,500
Addition and subtraction,
also at the same level.

21
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,360
So let's figure what the
order of operations say that

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,290
this should evaluate to.

23
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,100
So the first thing we're going
to do is our parentheses.

24
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,590
And we have a lot of
parentheses here.

25
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,800
We have this expression in
parentheses right there, and

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,930
then even within that we
have these parentheses.

27
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,370
So our order of operations say,
look, do your parentheses

28
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,120
first, but in order to evaluate
this outer parentheses-- this

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,910
orange thing-- we're going to
have to evaluate this thing

30
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,750
in yellow right there.

31
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,910
Well, if we look at just inside
of it, the first thing we want

32
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,690
to do is simplify the
parentheses inside

33
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,940
the parentheses.

34
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,590
So you see this 5
minus 2 right there?

35
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,560
We're going to do that
first no matter what.

36
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,690
And so this simplifies to--
I'll do it step by step.

37
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,480
Once you get the hang of
it, you can do multiple

38
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,570
steps at once.

39
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,770
So this is going to be
7 plus 3 times the 5

40
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,710
minus 2, which is 3.

41
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,620
And all of those have
parentheses around it.

42
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,780
And of course, you have
all the stuff on either

43
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,960
side-- the divide 4-- no.

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,820
Oops.

45
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,650
That's not what I want.

46
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,760
I wanted to copy and paste.

47
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,840
I want to copy and paste
that right there.

48
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,246
So copy, then-- no, that's
giving me the wrong thing.

49
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:57,290
It would've been easier--
let me just rewrite it.

50
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,230
That's the easiest thing.

51
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,590
I'm having technical
difficulties.

52
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,660
So divided by 4 times 2.

53
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,200
And on this side, you had that
7 times 2 plus this thing in

54
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,760
orange parentheses there.

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,060
Now, at any step you
just look again.

56
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,690
We always want to do
parentheses first.

57
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,140
Well, you keep wanting to
do and is there really

58
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,750
no parentheses left?

59
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,210
So we have to evaluate this
parentheses in orange here.

60
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,160
So we have to evaluate
this thing first.

61
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,550
But in order to evaluate
this thing, we have

62
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,810
to look inside of it.

63
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,290
And when you look inside of it,
you have 7 plus 3 times 3.

64
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,970
So if you just had 7 plus
3 times 3, how would

65
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,150
you evaluate it?

66
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,260
Well, look back to your
order of operations.

67
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,550
We're inside the parentheses
here, so inside of it there are

68
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,585
no longer any parentheses.

69
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:48,085
So the next thing we should do... There are no exponents. The next thing is multiplication.

70
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,970
So we do that before we do
any addition or subtraction.

71
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,250
So we want to do the 3 times
3 before we add the 7.

72
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,090
So this is going to be 7
plus-- and the 3 times

73
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,270
3 we want to do first.

74
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,850
We want to do the
multiplication first.

75
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,380
7 plus 9.

76
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,360
That's going to be in
the orange parentheses.

77
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,020
And then you have the 7
times 2 plus that, on

78
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,870
the left hand side.

79
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,060
You have the divided by 4 times
2 on the right hand side.

80
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,370
And now this-- the thing in
parentheses-- because we

81
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,200
still want to do the
parentheses first.

82
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,650
Pretty easy to evaluate.

83
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,770
What's 7 plus 9?

84
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,040
7 plus 9 is 16.

85
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,280
And so everything we have
simplifies to 7 times 2 plus

86
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,140
16 divided by 4 times 2.

87
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,103
Now we don't have any
parentheses left, so we

88
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,910
don't have to worry
about the P in PEMDAS.

89
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,610
We have no E, no
exponents in this.

90
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,650
So then we go straight to
multiplication and division.

91
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,970
We have a multiplication--
we have some multiplication

92
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,200
going on there.

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
We have some division
going on here, and a

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
multiplication there.

95
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,210
So we should do these
next, before we do this

96
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,670
addition right there.

97
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,830
So we could do this
multiplication.

98
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,260
We could do that
multiplication.

99
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,480
7 times 2 is 14.

100
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,015
We're going to wait
to do that addition.

101
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:12,730
And then here we have a
16 divided by 4 times 2.

102
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,770
That gets priority of the
addition, so we're going to do

103
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,160
that before we do the addition.

104
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,370
But how do we evaluate that?

105
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,810
Do we do the division first,
or the multiplication first?

106
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,340
And remember, I told you in the
last video, when you have 2--

107
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,760
when you have multiple
operations of the same level--

108
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,190
in this case, division and
multiplication-- they're

109
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,220
at the same level.

110
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,460
You're safest going
left to right.

111
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,360
Or you should go left to right.

112
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,950
So you do 16 divided by 4 is 4.

113
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,180
So this thing right here--
simplify 16 divided

114
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,680
by 4 times 2.

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,420
It simplifies to 4 times 2.

116
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,800
That's this thing in
green right there.

117
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,180
And then we're going to want to
do the multiplication next.

118
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,050
So this is going to simplify
to-- because multiplication

119
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,930
takes priority over addition--
this simplifies to 8.

120
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,740
And so you get 14-- this
14 right here-- plus 8.

121
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,730
And what's 14 plus 8?

122
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,190
That is 22.

123
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,450
That is equal to 22.

124
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,990
And we are done.
