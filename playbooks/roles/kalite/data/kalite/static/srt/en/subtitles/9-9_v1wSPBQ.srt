1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
At its core, a bitcoin is just basically a chain

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of digital signatures that really reflect the coin's path

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
through the bitcoin ecosystem. And here, I think it's actually conceptually

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
easier to think of bitcoins as collective

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
entries into a ledger rather than as a physical

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
coin, because if you think about it, in a ledger, you have a record of

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
transaction histories, which happens with in Bitcoin, whereas with a

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
physical coin, it's more like a memory list, there's no history

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in a physical coin of where the coin has really been in the past, ok?

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, in this context, you can think of a transaction as just a digitally

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
signed declaration by one party

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of its intent to transfer some bitcoins that they possess to

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
another set of parties. And, when I say that one party possesses a certain number

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of bitcoins, I really just mean here that there was some previous transaction on record that everybody's agreed to

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in which the party now transfering the bitcoins was itself the recepient

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of a previous transfer of those bitcoins. Alright,now I realize it is a bit convoluted,

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so maybe to help better understand the mechanics of a transaction, I could do an example of what would happen

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the context of an actual bitcoin transaction.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's say we have a party, and let's call her Alice, which is the common

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
name we use for parties in cryptographic schemes, and let's

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
say she wants to transfer some bitcoins to Bob,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and let's say she has the intention of wanting to transfer

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
50 bitcoins to Bob

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, remember, that anybody who transacts in the bitcoin ecosystem is not

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
actually not transacting

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
under their real name, their actual name, but rather they are

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going by a very specific identity, a pseudonym

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
within the bitcoin ecosystem, and that identity, that pseudonym actually

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
corresponds to a public verification key for a digit signature scheme

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So in this case, let's say Alice's identity in the system

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is really some public verification key which we'll call

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"VK of A," Alice's verification key, and

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the context of Bob, let's say his public verification key is

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some "VK sub B." So, these are keys that are used

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
within digital signature schemes, and so we can that Alice

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
has generated this key at some point and that she made it public, and then Bob

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
did the same thing, and so they now both have identities within the system, and these identities

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are just sequences of numbers that correspond to public

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
keys for verification in the context of a cryptographic digital

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
signature.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, remember, that these values also correspond to

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
private values. So, each person who's got a public key will have

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a corresponding private key associated with that public key,

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in this case, we'll call

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the private key, or the secret key, which is in fact a sign-in key

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in this context, "SK of Alice"

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we'll say that Bob's sign-in key

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is some "SK of Bob."

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they're going to basically keep these private.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let's look at Alice herself, who has received

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the past, three transactions of bitcoins from other parties:

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
25 bitcoins from Carol, and we'll call Carol "VK of C" to

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
associate that with her key.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say she got 20 bitcoins from

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
David, and let's say she got 20 more bitcoins

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from Ted. So, these

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
bitcoins correspond to different people

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who provided Alice with bitcoins in the past

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so, as you can see, Alice now

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
has an aggregate of 65 (20 + 20 + 25) bitcoins.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, as a result, she has a sufficient number to

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
be able to transfer 50 of those bitcoins to Bob.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, to start off with, a transaction from Alice to Bob for 50 bitcoins

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will contain information about these previous transactions.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, each of these previous transactions, where Alice received some bitcoins,

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these have all been recorded in the bitcoin ecosystem.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, they are going to be made public,

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just like every other transaction.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, what Alice can actually do is

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
take some representation of these transactions

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and include them as part of the new transaction

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
basically as an anchor point, saying "I've received

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these bitcoins, and now I'm going to transfer

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some portion of these bitcoins to you, Bob."

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, in this context, actually she

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
does not need to include the full transaction details in

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the actual transaction record to Bob. What she can instead do

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is take th transaction details and apply a crytographic cash function

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to them to get a series of digests for each transaction

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, in this case, let's say she gets a digest that corresponds to

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the transaction from Carol, she has a digest that corresponds

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the digest form David, and she has

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a digest that corresponds to the digest from Ted.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, basically, include each of these digests into the
