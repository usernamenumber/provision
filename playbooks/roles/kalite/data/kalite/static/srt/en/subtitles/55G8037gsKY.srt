1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,190
In this video, I'm going to do
several examples of quadratic

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,820
equations that are really of a
special form, and it's really

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,150
a bit of warm-up for the next
video that we're going to do

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,670
on completing the square.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,910
So let me show you what
I'm talking about.

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:20,960
So let's say I have 4x
plus 1 squared, minus

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,330
8 is equal to 0.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,740
Now, based on everything we've
done so far, you might be

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,980
tempted to multiply this out,
then subtract 8 from the

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,380
constant you get out here, and
then try to factor it.

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,600
And then you're going to have
x minus something, times x

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,220
minus something else
is equal to 0.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,300
And you're going to say, oh, one
of these must be equal to

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,990
0, so x could be that or that.

16
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,760
We're not going to do that this
time, because you might

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,810
see something interesting
here.

18
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,090
We can solve this without
factoring it.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,050
And how do we do that?

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,950
Well, what happens if
we add 8 to both

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,070
sides of this equation?

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,480
Then the left-hand side of the
equation becomes 4x plus 1

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,240
squared, and these
8's cancel out.

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,130
The right-hand becomes
just a positive 8.

25
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,780
Now, what can we do to both
sides of this equation?

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,090
And this is just kind
of straight, vanilla

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,170
equation-solving.

28
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,930
This isn't any kind of
fancy factoring.

29
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,700
We can take the square root of
both sides of this equation.

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,600
We could take the square root.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,410
So 4x plus 1-- I'm just taking
the square root of both sides.

32
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,840
You take the square root of both
sides, and, of course,

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,740
you want to take the positive
and the negative square root,

34
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,390
because 4x plus 1 could be the
positive square root of 8, or

35
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,400
it could be the negative
square root of 8.

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,100
So 4x plus 1 is equal to the
positive or negative

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,860
square root of 8.

38
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,450
Instead of 8, let me write
8 as 4 times 2.

39
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,350
We all know that's what 8 is,
and obviously the square root

40
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,820
of 4x plus 1 squared
is 4x plus 1.

41
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,500
So we get 4x plus 1 is equal
to-- we can factor out the 4,

42
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,840
or the square root of 4, which
is 2-- is equal to the plus or

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,250
minus times 2 times the square
root of 2, right?

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,460
Square root of 4 times square
root of 2 is the same thing as

45
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,290
square root of 4 times the
square root of 2, plus or

46
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,850
minus the square root of 4
is that 2 right there.

47
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,970
Now, it might look like a really
bizarro equation, with

48
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,340
this plus or minus 2 times
the square of 2,

49
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,020
but it really isn't.

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,010
These are actually two numbers
here, and we're actually

51
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,210
simultaneously solving
two equations.

52
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,980
We could write this as 4x plus
1 is equal to the positive 2,

53
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:52,360
square root of 2, or 4x plus 1
is equal to negative 2 times

54
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,510
the square root of 2.

55
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,110
This one statement is equivalent
to this right here,

56
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,230
because we have this plus or
minus here, this or statement.

57
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,710
Let me solve all of these
simultaneously.

58
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,360
So if I subtract 1 from
both sides of this

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,030
equation, what do I have?

60
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,330
On the left-hand side, I'm
just left with 4x.

61
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,330
On the right-hand side, I
have-- you can't really

62
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,260
mathematically, I mean, you
could do them if you had a

63
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,210
calculator, but I'll just leave
it as negative 1 plus or

64
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,570
minus the square root, or 2
times the square root of 2.

65
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,200
That's what 4x is equal to.

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,560
If we did it here, as two
separate equations, same idea.

67
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,715
Subtract 1 from both sides of
this equation, you get 4x is

68
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:36,310
equal to negative 1 plus 2,
times the square root of 2.

69
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,150
This equation, subtract
1 from both sides.

70
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,090
4x is equal to negative
1 minus 2, times the

71
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,560
square root of 2.

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,970
This statement right here is
completely equivalent to these

73
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,880
two statements.

74
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,590
Now, last step, we just have to
divide both sides by 4, so

75
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,770
you divide both sides by 4,
and you get x is equal to

76
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,620
negative 1 plus or minus
2, times the square

77
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,570
root of 2, over 4.

78
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,670
Now, this statement is
completely equivalent to

79
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,550
dividing each of these by 4,
and you get x is equal to

80
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:21,470
negative 1 plus 2, times the
square root 2, over 4.

81
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,890
This is one solution.

82
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,270
And then the other solution is x
is equal to negative 1 minus

83
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,370
2 roots of 2, all
of that over 4.

84
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,340
That statement and these two
statements are equivalent.

85
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,230
And if you want, I encourage you
to-- let's substitute one

86
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,280
of these back in, just so you
feel confident that something

87
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,960
as bizarro as one of these
expressions can be a solution

88
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,970
to a nice, vanilla-looking
equation like this.

89
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,870
So let's substitute
it back in.

90
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:58,290
4 times x, or 4 times negative
1, plus 2 root 2, over 4, plus

91
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,450
1 squared, minus 8
is equal to 0.

92
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,350
Now, these 4's cancel out, so
you're left with negative 1

93
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,260
plus 2 roots 2, plus
1, squared, minus

94
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,410
8 is equal to 0.

95
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,410
This negative 1 and this
positive 1 cancel out, so

96
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,690
you're left with 2 roots
of 2 squared, minus

97
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,840
8 is equal to 0.

98
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,680
And then what are you
going to have here?

99
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,460
So when you square this, you
get 4 times 2, minus 8 is

100
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,060
equal to 0, which is true.

101
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,300
8 minus 8 is equal to 0.

102
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,740
And if you try this one out,
you're going to get the exact

103
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,180
same answer.

104
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,220
Let's do another
one like this.

105
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,960
And remember, these are special
forms where we have

106
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,470
squares of binomials
in our expression.

107
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,620
And we're going to see that the
entire quadratic formula

108
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,870
is actually derived from a
notion like this, because you

109
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,250
can actually turn any, you can
turn any, quadratic equation

110
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,050
into a perfect square equalling
something else.

111
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,525
We'll see that two
videos from now.

112
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:08,260
But let's get a little
warmed up just seeing

113
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,410
this type of thing.

114
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:16,650
So let's say you have x squared
minus 10x, plus 25 is

115
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,680
equal to 9.

116
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,920
Now, once again your
temptation-- and it's not a

117
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,960
bad temptation-- would be to
subtract 9 from both sides, so

118
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,320
you get a 0 on the right-hand
side, but before you do that,

119
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,050
just inspect this really fast.
And say, hey, is this just

120
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,140
maybe a perfect square
of a binomial?

121
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,150
And you see-- well, what two
numbers when I multiply them I

122
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,760
get positive 25, and when I add
them I get negative 10?

123
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,380
And hopefully negative
5 jumps out at you.

124
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:52,060
So this expression right here is
x minus 5, times x minus 5.

125
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,495
So this left-hand side can be
written as x minus 5 squared,

126
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:59,910
and the right-hand
side is still 9.

127
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,540
And I want to really
emphasize.

128
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,860
I don't want this to ruin all of
the training you've gotten

129
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,280
on factoring so far.

130
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,260
We can only do this when this
is a perfect square.

131
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,210
If you got, like, x minus 3,
times x plus 4, and that would

132
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,120
be equal to 9, that would
be a dead end.

133
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,580
You wouldn't be able to
really do anything

134
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,490
constructive with that.

135
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,080
Only because this is a perfect
square, can we now say x minus

136
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,640
5 squared is equal to 9, and
now we can take the square

137
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,060
root of both sides.

138
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:31,280
So we could say that x minus 5
is equal to plus or minus 3.

139
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,050
Add 5 to both sides of this
equation, you get x is equal

140
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:43,050
to 5 plus or minus 3, or x is
equal to-- what's 5 plus 3?

141
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:49,780
Well, x could be 8 or x could be
equal to 5 minus 3, or x is

142
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,340
equal to 2.

143
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,890
Now, we could have done this
equation, this quadratic

144
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,070
equation, the traditional
way, the way you were

145
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,160
tempted to do it.

146
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,600
What happens if you subtract
9 from both

147
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,230
sides of this equation?

148
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,650
You'll get x squared
minus 10x.

149
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,820
And what's 25 minus 9?

150
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:16,040
25 minus 9 is 16, and that
would be equal to 0.

151
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,970
And here, this would be just a
traditional factoring problem,

152
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,400
the type that we've seen
in the last few videos.

153
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,710
What two numbers, when you take
their product, you get

154
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:29,020
positive 16, and when you sum
them you get negative 10?

155
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,800
And maybe negative
8 and negative 2

156
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,390
jump into your brain.

157
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,954
So we get x minus 8, times
x minus 2 is equal to 0.

158
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:43,710
And so x could be equal to 8
or x could be equal to 2.

159
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,450
That's the fun thing about
algebra: you can do things in

160
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,670
two completely different ways,
but as long as you do them in

161
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,210
algebraically-valid ways,
you're not going to get

162
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,170
different answers.

163
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,330
And on some level, if you
recognize this, this is easier

164
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,950
because you didn't have to do
that little game in your head,

165
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,130
in terms of, oh, what two
numbers, when you multiply

166
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,840
them you get 16, and when you
add them you get negative 10?

167
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,340
Here, you just said, OK, this is
x minus 5-- oh, I guess you

168
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,020
did have to do it.

169
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,020
You had to say, oh, 5 times 5
is 25, and negative 10 is

170
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,160
negative 5 plus negative 5.

171
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,050
So I take that back, you still
have to do that little

172
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,490
game in your head.

173
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,700
So let's do another one.

174
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,880
Let's do one more of these, just
to really get ourselves

175
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,230
nice and warmed up here.

176
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:38,140
So, let's say we have x squared
plus 18x, plus 81 is

177
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,470
equal to 1.

178
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,940
So once again, we can
do it in two ways.

179
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,580
We could subtract 1 from both
sides, or we could recognize

180
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:53,140
that this is x plus
9, times x plus 9.

181
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,010
This right here, 9 times 9
is 81, 9 plus 9 is 18.

182
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,210
So we can write our equation
as x plus 9

183
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,760
squared is equal to 1.

184
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,940
Take the square root of both
sides, you get x plus 9 is

185
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,240
equal to plus or minus
the square root of 1,

186
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,910
which is just 1.

187
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,140
So x is equal to-- subtract 9
from both sides-- negative 9

188
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,866
plus or minus 1.

189
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:21,060
And that means that x could be
equal to-- negative 9 plus 1

190
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,620
is negative 8, or x could be
equal to-- negative 9 minus 1,

191
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,930
which is negative 10.

192
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,560
And once again, you could have
done this the traditional way.

193
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,730
You could have subtracted 1 from
both sides and you would

194
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:41,240
have gotten x squared plus 18x,
plus 80 is equal to 0.

195
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,370
And you'd say, hey, gee, 8 times
10 is 80, 8 plus 10 is

196
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,850
18, so you get x plus 8, times
x plus 10 is equal to 0.

197
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,640
And then you'd get x could be
equal to negative 8, or x

198
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,360
could be equal to negative 10.

199
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,710
That was good warm up.

200
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,250
Now, I think we're ready to
tackle completing the square.

201
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:02,466
