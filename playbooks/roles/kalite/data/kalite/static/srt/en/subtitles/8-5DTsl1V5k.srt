1
00:00:04,258 --> 00:00:09,638
- My favorite painting is John Everett Millais' "Ophelia," a Pre-Raphaelite painting.

2
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:11,117
- What do you mean by Pre-Raphaelite?

3
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:17,306
- Well the Pre-Raphaelites were a group of artists in the 1850s in England, actually they formed a group in 1848

4
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:24,004
and their goal was to challenge the official ideas of art and what it should be.

5
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:28,155
- Raphael was a Renaissance artist who really made things

6
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:30,873
exact and very technical

7
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:34,436
- Raphael was a Renaissance artist who was revered

8
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:38,940
in the Victorian era. But by then they were so used

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,672
to looking at Raphael and painting like Raphael

10
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:45,950
they so admired him that it had become a kind of formula for painting.

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,356
The Pre-Raphaelites said, "We want to go back to look at the art before Raphael because we have descended

12
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:55,764
into a formula and we've lost our real connection

13
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,456
to looking and observing the world.

14
00:00:57,456 --> 00:01:03,180
So they painted directly from looking closely at nature.

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,018
They really fit with these ideas that we've been talking about

16
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:11,132
of how we value art that challenges the establishment.

17
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:17,603
- And I definitely appreciate that. What this piece does it still is aesthetically beautiful in a traditional sense

18
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:21,818
and you also look at it and say, well there is definitely skill there

19
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:25,747
I can't just show up at a canvas and produce something like that.

20
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:29,539
- Yeah, the painting is incredibly absorbing. In person it is

21
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:34,417
astoundingly beautiful. The colors are rich and deep,

22
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:42,166
you can look at how the artist painted every flower, every blade of grass, every reed. So that idea of technical skill -

23
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,117
- I think even the choice of subject is very beautiful

24
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:48,283
-beautiful. Yeah the subject and the way it's painted are both beautiful

25
00:01:48,283 --> 00:01:51,919
and the way it's painted shows great technical skill.

26
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:55,787
- So for this one I get it on a bunch of different levels.

27
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:59,571
It challenged people, it was kind of a pivotal piece of art, and

28
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:03,933
it is beautiful and technically sophisticated.

29
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:06,430
What are we looking at on the right-hand side?

30
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,030
- Barnett Newman's "Vir Heroicus Sublimis"

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,279
- This is kind of the classic when people look at it and they say "Well, that looks nice, it might look nice above my sofa,"

32
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:18,633
but there's a big difference here where most people would

33
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:24,813
look at the left-hand side and say "Gee, that is pivotal, challenging, and very technically beautiful,"

34
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:27,151
while on the right-hand side they say, "Oh, I could do that."

35
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:31,982
In fact you see on these home improvement shows, people say we need some artwork and literally they produce

36
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:34,685
something that looks not too different than that in a little amount of time.

37
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:37,299
-Absolutley. So it's not about technical skill at all.

38
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:44,899
But for me, what the Newman asks me to do is something that I really value in my experience of art.

39
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:48,430
What it does is it concentrates my attention.

40
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:55,832
First of all, it's really big. So when you're in its space, you feel really overcome by it.

41
00:02:55,832 --> 00:03:00,796
You feel it kind of calling out to you so you are kind of drawn to it and you walk up close

42
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:05,349
and it almost starts to become your world.

43
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:14,484
The color is really intense. What happens to me when I'm in the presence of the painting is that I start to notice the color

44
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:20,051
and its effect on me and the way that colors remind me of feelings.

45
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:23,897
-I guess the cynical, and there are people who look at that and say

46
00:03:23,897 --> 00:03:28,901
"I can appreciate that, it's a big aesthetic, red thing with some lines in it.

47
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,613
But someone else could have done it or someone can do it now."

48
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:40,781
So that's not why -- what you just described, you are appreciating the aesthetics of it and it is this huge paiting and I can see that,

49
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:44,776
but it's more that he was the first to --

50
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:50,048
- It actually is a lot more complicated than it looks. So it draws us into it.

51
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:58,107
Then when we start looking at the lines, we notice that they go from the top to the bottom, that he created the lines

52
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:01,151
in different ways, that they have different qualities.

53
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:04,565
These are hard things to tell when we're looking at the reproduction.

54
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:11,245
It draws us in and I find myself paying attention in a way that I don't normally in my everyday world.

55
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:15,217
I really appreciate that for that moment in the museum,

56
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:22,445
I'm taken out of my everyday world of being distracted and surrounded by a million different things that I hardly notice

57
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:26,111
and I'm being asked to really visually focus.

58
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:32,317
- I actually appreciate it in a similar way, I've actually never visted it in person but I can somewhat imagine on a larger

59
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:35,274
scale, especially if you go up close and you see the detail there.

60
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:43,790
There does seem to be a fundamental division between what -- I mean they're both aesthetically captivating and interesting.

61
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:51,310
The painting on the left, I think you go cross-culture really almost anytime in history, and you would have gotten some appreciation for it.

62
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,479
While the painting on the right, they also would say "well that's an interesting way to paint a wall," or something but

63
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,660
they wouldn't put them in the same category. Is that fair to say?

64
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,578
- I think that what you're saying is fair. There is a real rupture here.

65
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:11,646
The image on the left is still very much a part of history of art making that has to do with representation and depiction.

66
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:15,811
I think that what we're looking at on the right it is a fundamental break.

67
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:19,831
The painting on the left was a fundamental break in its own day, this Pre-Raphaelite idea.

68
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:23,674
- It was more of a break in style though, not really hitting "what is art?"

69
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:28,564
-That's right. It is pure abstraction. Barnett Newman was an abstract expressionist.

70
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:33,408
He belonged to a group of artists that were thinking about painting in very different ways.

71
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:38,863
They were asking whether or not art had to be something other than what it was.

72
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:44,077
In other words, if you look at "Ophelia," you see this woman who is drowning, who is submerged in this stream

73
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,197
and it is beautiful. But in a sense, it's a lie.

74
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:52,563
This is color paste on canvas that is trying to represent something that it's not.

75
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:55,359
It's a falsehood, it's an illusion.

76
00:05:55,359 --> 00:06:03,215
The image on the right is saying, "Can we be true to the materiality of our art and still create something that is profound?"

77
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:10,679
Think about music for a moment. In music, we do not require a symphony to represent a landscape. It might,

78
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:15,055
and certain symphonies will do that, but music is taken on its own

79
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:15,975
- Or the human voice, right

80
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:23,696
- But music is taken on its own terms. Music is about tone, it's about rhythm, it's about its own internal logic.

81
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:25,624
Painting had never been that.

82
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:30,573
- And you could say, in fact, that the Millais distracts us.

83
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:36,692
from those things that Steven is referring to. To color, to shape, to lines.

84
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:37,624
- The paint itself.

85
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:41,992
- Yeah, in a way what the Newman is doing is concentrating that.

86
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:45,409
Look at it, don't be distracted by all these other things.

87
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,094
- Yeah, I'm not trying to be a scene out of Shakespeare.

88
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:52,677
- But can I still be as profound, can I still be as emotionally powerful?

89
00:06:52,677 --> 00:07:00,807
Here an artist is saying that a canvas is two-dimensional; I am going to create something that seems at least at first

90
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:07,073
blush to be absolutely flat. But then, look at those lines. How do they occupy space?

91
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:12,055
Do they begin to create an illusion of space? In a subtle way, Beth mentioned just a moment ago

92
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:22,238
that the lines move from the top to the bottom, so they do measure the size of the canvas and in that way, announce the two-dimensionality of the canvas.

93
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:30,658
But at the same time, they are different tones and different qualities of density. They recede or they project forward.

94
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:36,305
- So let me ask you, do one of those lines move back, does one come forward?

95
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:42,375
- It is interesting, there is that, it has this core primitive dimensionality to it

96
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:47,790
and you start to see -- I never thought of it that way before.

97
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,858
You are right, what is on the left is a lie. It's something trying to be something that it's not

98
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:55,620
while on the right, it literally is, this is the painting. The painting is what you are trying to see.

99
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,238
It's not trying to be a TV set for the rest of reality.

100
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:06,938
-So there is a kind of fundamental truth to the painting on the right that was up-ending 2,000 years of representation

101
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:09,103
-Or longer, probably, I mean cave paintings right?

102
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:20,327
-Absolutely. One could say 38,000 years of tradition. How radical is that? How brave is that? How heroic is that?
