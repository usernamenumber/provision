2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:05,823
In the previous three videos,

3
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:08,936
we looked briefly at what it was like to be a Christian

4
00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:12,958
before the Reformation, before 1517.

5
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,185
Then we looked at Martin Luther;

6
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:17,664
we looked at his ideas, and the spread of his ideas,

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,517
as well as the violence that resulted.

8
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:21,098
And for our final video,

9
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:24,896
we want to look at the response by the Catholic Church and so,

10
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:27,983
whereas we call what Luther and his followers did

11
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:29,797
the Protestant Reformation,

12
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,097
the Church's response is referred to as

13
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:34,117
the Counter-Reformation,

14
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,665
the word "counter" here meaning "against."

15
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:39,056
Well, the Church had lost a lot.

16
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:42,686
The church had lost lands, it had lost -

17
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:43,511
- Faithful.

18
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,517
That's right, it lost souls!

19
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:46,761
And in the last video,

20
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:49,360
we ended talking about violence.

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,354
But the violence wasn't always against people.

22
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:53,661
Sometimes, it was also against things.

23
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:57,498
And churches, that is, the architecture of the Roman Catholics,

24
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:59,565
which existed throughout Western Europe,

25
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:02,212
was an important focus of the violence of the Protestants

26
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:04,066
against the Catholic Church.

27
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:07,418
The practice of Catholicism was incredibly visual,

28
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:10,608
and there was a real concern among the Protestants -

29
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:14,045
not so much by Luther, but mostly by his followers -

30
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:15,710
that images were being abused,

31
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,761
that they were being prayed to

32
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,814
as if the images had power themselves,

33
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,834
instead of just a way of reaching the Divine,

34
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,124
of passing through the images to the Divine.

35
00:01:26,124 --> 00:01:27,435
That's right. Calvin, specifically,

36
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:29,363
had a problem with this, and believed that

37
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:32,732
the images in churches were actually creating a kind of idolatry.

38
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:34,257
This goes back to the Second Commandment:

39
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:37,520
"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,206
or any likeness of any thing that is in the heaven above,

41
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:43,030
or that is in the earth beneath,

42
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,269
or that is in the water under the earth."

43
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,068
So, this notion that to create is, in a sense,

44
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,543
usurping a little bit of God's responsibility.

45
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:52,690
That is, God creates.

46
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,693
When an artist creates, it is a kind of falsehood.

47
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:57,343
It is creating an idol.

48
00:01:57,343 --> 00:02:02,326
So, Protestants began waves of iconoclasm -

49
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:04,363
that is, the destruction of images.

50
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:07,963
Let's take apart that word for a moment, "iconoclasm."

51
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:09,834
It's a compound that's made of two words:

52
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:12,140
"icon," which is Greek for "image," and

53
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,810
"clasm," which means "violence."

54
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,109
So, it is literally "violence against images."

55
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:21,653
And there were iconoclastic riots within five years or so

56
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:23,460
after Luther's "Ninety-Five Theses."

57
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,975
This is one of the great tragedies in the history of art, actually,

58
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:31,886
where an untold number of paintings, of sculptures, were destroyed.

59
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:36,658
And this happened especially in Northern Europe, in the Netherlands.

60
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:39,156
So in essence, what the Protestants often did is,

61
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:40,994
they took over a Catholic church,

62
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,105
and they stripped it of all of those sensual forms,

63
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:47,231
all of that sculpture, those tapestries,

64
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:50,689
and left it a kind of pristine space.

65
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:55,551
So, we know that Luther is going against Church teaching

66
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:56,952
in all these different ways:

67
00:02:56,952 --> 00:03:00,285
Faith is the path to salvation, not good works.

68
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:02,981
Scripture is the way to understand God,

69
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,446
not listening to the teachings of the Church.

70
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:08,521
Now, the Catholic Church didn't take all of this lying down, right?

71
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,548
We know that there were efforts to make Luther

72
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:14,278
bend to their will, right? At the Diet of Worms,

73
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,842
for example; Luther is excommunicated after that.

74
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:20,628
And by "excommunicated," we mean, basically,

75
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:23,012
is no longer a member of the Church.

76
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:27,030
In 1545, the Church holds something called the Council of Trent,

77
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,411
essentially a kind of meeting of all of the highest levels of the Church in Europe.

78
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:36,839
At first, the idea was really to reconcile with the Protestants.

79
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:39,645
Protestants were invited. They didn't show up,

80
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:44,655
however, and in the end, reconciliation was clearly impossible.

81
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:47,517
One of the most important outcomes of the Council of Trent

82
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:51,238
was that the Catholic Church reaffirmed its doctrines.

83
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:52,728
That is, it doubled down.

84
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:57,680
It said the very things that Luther had taken issue with were reaffirmed.

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,941
So, regarding the issue of

86
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:01,708
whether good works have a role in salvation,

87
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,283
the Church said indeed they do.

88
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:07,856
Regarding Purgatory and the efficacy of indulgences -

89
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:10,736
do indulgences do anything, does Purgatory exist -

90
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:13,180
the Church affirmed all of that.

91
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,609
The Church affirmed transubstantiation,

92
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:18,340
the changing of the bread and wine during the Eucharist

93
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,438
to the body and blood of Christ.

94
00:04:20,438 --> 00:04:25,526
And by doing so, it affirmed the power and importance of the priesthood,

95
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,730
and of the hierarchy of the Church.

96
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,951
And lastly, the Church affirmed that Scripture alone wasn't enough,

97
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:34,750
that one really also needed the teachings,

98
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,043
the traditions of the Church.

99
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,607
So, they gave very little ground.

100
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:42,063
All they did was agree that in some areas,

101
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:44,220
there was room for reform.

102
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,244
They did try to stamp out the kind of corruption

103
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,276
that had, in part, led to the Reformation.

104
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:51,208
But let's get back to the images for a moment.

105
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,450
Because that was also important in the Council of Trent.

106
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,770
The Council said this: "Images of Christ,

107
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,733
of the Virgin Mother of God, and of the other saints

108
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,979
are to be placed and retained especially in the churches,

109
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:07,312
and due honor and veneration is to be given to them."

110
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:09,148
So they're reaffirming, immediately:

111
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:11,191
Images belong in the Church.

112
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,781
But what's important is why.

113
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:16,107
They say, quote: "Because the honor which is shown them

114
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,486
is referred to the prototypes which they represent."

115
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,577
So, if somebody is honoring a statue of the Virgin Mary,

116
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:27,442
they are actually affirming the honor to the Virgin Mary herself.

117
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,904
But the Church said there was even more benefit.

118
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:32,445
Yes. "Let the bishops diligently teach,

119
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:36,238
that by means of the stories of the mysteries of our redemption

120
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:40,008
portrayed in paintings and other representations

121
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:44,755
the people are instructed and confirmed in their articles of faith."

122
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:47,113
So, art was a way of actually didactically

123
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,162
getting the ideas of the Church across to lay people,

124
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:52,019
many of whom were still illiterate.

125
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,756
And deepening their faith. That's right.

126
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:59,031
"Also, that great profit is derived from all holy images

127
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,733
because through the saints the miracles of God

128
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:06,037
and salutary examples are set before the eyes of the faithful,

129
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:09,693
so that they may fashion their own life and conduct

130
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:15,578
in imitation of the saints and be moved to adore and love God and cultivate piety."

131
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:18,745
So, the way in which art functions as an example

132
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,887
that we can follow in our daily lives.

133
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:23,226
So the Church's response is threefold.

134
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:27,237
One, they reaffirm all the basic doctrines of the Church

135
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,761
that had been attacked by the Protestants.

136
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:32,808
They begin a major campaign to spread the teachings

137
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:34,838
of the Catholic faith all around the world.

138
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:37,224
Well remember, this is the Age of Discovery.

139
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:39,083
The New World has been discovered,

140
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,598
there's increasing trade with Asia, and with Africa;

141
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:47,203
and so, the Catholics are really evangelizing in all of these places.

142
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:50,279
The last in this threefold response of the Church

143
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,446
is an effort to stamp out heresy.

144
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:56,133
So the Church establishes the Inquisition, the Roman Inquisition;

145
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:59,196
the Church also creates the Index of Forbidden Books.

146
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:03,490
And it's just at this time that Ignatius Loyola

147
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,992
founds the Jesuit order.

148
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:08,612
The Jesuits are all about faithfulness.

149
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:11,151
They have an absolute faith in the Pope,

150
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,250
and they are at the Pope's disposal.

151
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,509
The Jesuits establish schools,

152
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,707
they spread the Christian faith throughout the world,

153
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:19,521
and they fought Protestantism.

154
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,520
There's a fabulous and very literal example

155
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,046
of all of these ideas of the Counter-Reformation

156
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:28,318
in a sculpture by an artist whose name is Le Gros,

157
00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:31,789
in the mother church of the Jesuits in Rome.

158
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:36,993
The title of this sculpture is "Religion Overthrowing Heresy and Hatred."

159
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:38,390
Okay now, first of all, it's important to know

160
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,896
that the sculpture is just to the right and below

161
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:45,334
a very large altar to St. Ignatius Loyola.

162
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:48,306
At the top left, we see the figure of Religion

163
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:51,192
wielding a thunderbolt and a cross.

164
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:54,785
Now, by Religion, Le Gros means Roman Catholicism.

165
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:59,042
And Religion is looking down at, and about to attack,

166
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:04,163
two figures. One is an older female figure who represents Hatred,

167
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:07,126
and the other figure, falling towards us,

168
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:11,563
wrestling with snakes, is the allegoral figure that represents Heresy.

169
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:13,861
He's falling over a series of books.

170
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,306
And one of those book has on its spine Luther's name,

171
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:20,304
so heresy here couldn't be any more explicit.

172
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:23,404
Heresy is Luther. It is Protestantism.

173
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:26,975
And as if that isn't making the point sharply enough,

174
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:30,082
on the left, we see a little angelic figure,

175
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:34,494
who's ripping pages out of the book by Luther's follower Zwingli.

176
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:39,791
It's important to remember that each side saw the other as the devil.

177
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:43,290
Luther called the Pope the Antichrist.

178
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,340
The Pope called Luther the Antichrist.

179
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,614
It was a time of black and white.

180
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,463
There was no middle ground.

181
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:56,083
And these divisions literally reshaped the countries of Europe.

182
00:08:56,083 --> 00:09:00,777
Even now, the countries in Southern Europe are predominantly Catholic.

183
00:09:00,777 --> 00:09:03,782
The countries in Northern Europe are predominantly Protestant.

184
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:06,672
And even as late as the twentieth century,

185
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,213
there is violence that erupts between these factions.

186
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:13,496
We saw that through most of the twentieth century in Ireland, for example.

187
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:15,040
It's also interesting to think about

188
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,756
the ways that the Protestant Reformation set the stage for the modern world,

189
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:23,853
this idea of not listening to a single authority,

190
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:26,345
but listening to your own conscience.

191
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:29,709
I think this is a key feature of the modern world.

192
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:39,741
