1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,920
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,530
I'm now going to introduce
you to a new tool for

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,370
solving derivatives.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,010
Really between this rule, which
is the product rule, and the

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,000
chain rule and just knowing a
lot of function derivatives,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,330
you'll be ready to tackle
almost any derivative problem.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,420
Let's start with
the chain rule.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:31,810
Let's say that f of x is equal
to h of x times g of x.

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,780
This is the product rule.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,080
In the chain rule it was f of
x is equal to h of g of x.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,310
Right?

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,730
I don't know if you
remember that.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,980
In this case, f of x is equal
to h of x times g of x.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,570
If that's the case, then f
prime of x is equal to the

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,940
derivative of the first
function times a second

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:55,450
function plus the first
function times the derivative

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,030
of the second function.

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,990
Pretty straightforward.

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,350
Let's apply it.

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,660
Let's say that-- I don't like
this brown color, let me pick

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,190
something more pleasant.

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,250
Maybe mauve.

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:17,270
Let's say that f of x is equal
to 5x to the fifth minus x to

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:29,850
the seventh times 20x squared
plus 3x to them mine 7.

25
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,610
So one way we could have
done it, we could just

26
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,520
multiply this out.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,310
This wouldn't be too bad, and
then take the derivative

28
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,200
like any polynomial.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
But let's use this product rule
that I've just shown you.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,470
So the product rules that says,
let me take the derivative of

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,890
the first expression, or h of x
if we wanted to map

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,240
it into this rule.

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,360
The derivative of that is
pretty straightforward.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,470
5 times 5 is 25.

35
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,160
25x to the fourth, right?

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,480
Then minus 7, x to the sixth.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,780
We're just going to multiply it
times this second expression,

38
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,290
doing nothing different to it.

39
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,980
Maybe I'll just do it
in a different color.

40
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:18,920
Times 20x plus 3x minus 7.

41
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,270
And then to that we will
add the derivative of

42
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,110
this second function.

43
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:35,000
The derivative of that second
function is 40x minus

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,590
21x to the minus eighth.

45
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,570
And that times this
first function.

46
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,870
I guess I'll switch
back to mauve, I think

47
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,140
you get the point.

48
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:51,480
5x to the fifth minus
x to the seventh.

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,660
All we did here was we said OK,
f of x is made of these two

50
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,730
expressions and they are
multiplied by each other.

51
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,930
If I want to take the
derivative of it, I take the

52
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,250
derivative of the first one and
multiply it by the second one.

53
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,530
And then I add that to the
derivative of the second

54
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,360
one and multiply it
by the first one.

55
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,050
Let's do some more examples
and I think that will

56
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,860
hit the point home.

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,752
Clear image.

58
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:18,850
Change the colors and
I'm back in business.

59
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,440
Let me think of a good problem.

60
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,410
Let me do another one like
this, and then I'll actually

61
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,790
introduce ones and the product
rule and the chain rule.

62
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:40,630
So let's say that f of x is
equal to 10x to the third plus

63
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:53,180
5x squared minus 7 times
20x to the eighth minus 7.

64
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,970
Then we say f prime of x,
what's the derivative of

65
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,710
this first expression.

66
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:05,900
It's 30x squared plus 10x.

67
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,290
And I just multiply it times
this expression, right?

68
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,570
20x to the eighth minus 7.

69
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,240
And I add that to the
derivative of this second

70
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,130
expression, this is all on one
line but I ran out of space,

71
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,600
160x to the seventh, right?

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,490
8 times 20 is 160.

73
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,520
And then the derivative
of 7 is zero.

74
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,440
So it's just 160x to
the seventh times this

75
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,060
first expression.

76
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:42,720
10x to the third plus 5x
squared minus seven.

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,290
There we go.

78
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,300
And you could simplify it.

79
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,190
You could multiply this out
if you wanted or you could

80
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,590
distribute this out if you
wanted, maybe try to

81
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,730
condense the terms.

82
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,420
But that's really just algebra.

83
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,030
So this is using
the product rule.

84
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,880
I'm going to do one more
example where I'll show you,

85
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,140
I'm going to use the product
and the chain rule and

86
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,170
I think this will
optimally confuse you.

87
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,225
I want to make sure
I have some space.

88
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,260
Here I'm going to use a
slightly different notation.

89
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,110
Instead of saying f of x and
then what's f prime of x, I'm

90
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:27,110
going to say y is equal to x
squared plus 2x to the fifth

91
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:40,200
times 3x to the minus three
plus x squared to the minus 7.

92
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,480
And I want to find the rate at
which y changes relative to x.

93
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,130
So I want to find dy over dx.

94
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,950
This is just like, if this
was f of x, it's just

95
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,360
like saying f prime of x.

96
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,290
This is just a Leibniz

97
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,470
notation.

98
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,560
So what do I do in
the chain rule?

99
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,630
First I want the
derivative of this term.

100
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,460
Let me use colors to make
it not too confusing.

101
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,950
So what's the derivative
of this term?

102
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,540
We are going to use
the chain rule first.

103
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:15,990
So we take the derivative of
the inside which is 2x plus 2

104
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,790
and multiply times
the derivative of the

105
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,330
larger expression.

106
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:26,920
But we keep x squared plus 3x
there so it's times 5 times

107
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,470
something to the fourth.

108
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,320
And that something is
x squared plus 2x.

109
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,460
So there we took the derivative
of this first term right here

110
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,300
and then the product rules says
we take the derivative of the

111
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,740
first term, we just multiply
it by the second term.

112
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:49,120
So the second term is just 3x
to the minus 3 plus x squared

113
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,080
and all that to the minus 7.

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,240
We did that and then to that we
add plus the derivative of this

115
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,870
second term times
this first term.

116
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,280
We're going to use the
chain rule again.

117
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,750
What's the derivative
of the second term?

118
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,890
I'll switch back to
the light blue.

119
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,840
Light blue means the derivative
of one of the terms.

120
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,320
So we take the derivative of
the inside, the derivative of

121
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:18,710
inside is minus 3 times 3 is
minus 9, x go down one to

122
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,210
the minus 4, plus 2x.

123
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,180
And now we take the derivative
of the whole thing.

124
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:34,090
Times minus 7 times something
to the minus 8, and that

125
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,360
something is this inside.

126
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,280
3x to the minus 3
plus x squared.

127
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,770
And then we multiply this
thing, this whole thing which

128
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,870
is the derivative of the second
term times the first term.

129
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:53,010
Times, and I'm just going to
keep going, times x squared

130
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,190
plus 2x to the fifth.

131
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,710
So this is a really, I
mean you might want to

132
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,730
simplify at this point.

133
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,480
You can take this minus
7 and multiply it

134
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,490
out and all of that.

135
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,350
But I think this
gives you the idea.

136
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,850
And if you have to multiply
this out and then do the

137
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,220
derivative if it's just a
polynomial, this would

138
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,080
take you forever.

139
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,110
But using the chain rule,
you're actually able to, even

140
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,250
though we ended up with a
pretty complicated answer,

141
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,110
we got the right answer.

142
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,230
And now we could actually
evaluate the slope of this very

143
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,990
complicated function at any
point just by substituting the

144
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,190
point into this fairly
complicated expression.

145
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,830
But at least we could do it.

146
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,970
I think you're going to find
that the chain and the product

147
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,230
rules become even more useful
once we start doing derivatives

148
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,970
of expressions other
than polynomials.

149
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,620
I'm going to teach you about
trigonometric functions and

150
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,710
natural log and logarithm
and exponential functions.

151
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,460
Actually, I'll probably do that
in the next presentation.

152
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,240
So I will see you soon.
