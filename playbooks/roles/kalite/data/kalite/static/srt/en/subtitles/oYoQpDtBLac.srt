1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,420
If I were to come over to your
place and say, name this

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,260
molecule, the first thing you
would do is you'd say, well,

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,410
look, we have a double
bond, So we're

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,550
dealing with an alkene.

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,140
We have four carbons in
the longest chain.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,590
There's actually
one chain here.

8
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,220
So it's one, two, three,
four carbons.

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,770
So the prefix will be but-, and
regardless of which end

10
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,830
you count from, the double bond
starts at the number two

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,700
carbon, so this is but-2-ene.

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,600
   

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,880
I'd say, well, that's very
good, and that is correct

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,870
based on everything
we've learned.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,190
But what about what about
this molecule?

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,840
What about the molecule
that looks like this?

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,550
   

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,160
And you'd go through
the same process.

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,740
You'd say it has
a double bond.

20
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,850
It's an alkene.

21
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,960
Our longest chain has
four carbons:

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,110
one, two, three, four.

23
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,590
Regardless of which end you
start counting from, the

24
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,150
double bond starts at the number
two carbon: one, two,

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,370
three, four.

26
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,880
So once again, you say, hey,
Sal, that's also but-2-ene.

27
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,590
   

28
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,710
And I'd point out that these
are each fundamentally

29
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,790
different molecules.

30
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,880
And the reason why they're
fundamentally different

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,180
molecules is because this double
bond can't rotate.

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,690
It's got that pi bond there
for that second bond that

33
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,460
keeps this carbon-carbon
bond rigid.

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,450
So it's not like the molecule
can switch configurations

35
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,390
between this-- it's not like
it can switch conformations

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,940
between this and that.

37
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,540
It cannot rotate around this
double bond, so these are

38
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,290
different molecules.

39
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,530
These are different molecules
that will behave different

40
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,840
chemically.

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,070
And because they behave
different, we have to have

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,630
different names for them.

43
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,390
Now, there's two different
naming conventions.

44
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,570
One is the simpler naming
convention, and it works when

45
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,750
we have one functional group on
each of the carbons in the

46
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,470
double bond.

47
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,630
And then in the next two videos,
we'll talk about the

48
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,250
slightly more advanced naming
scheme that will work when we

49
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,280
have more than one
functional group.

50
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,160
So the first way to name
it is if you have

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,080
your functional groups.

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,860
So let me circle the
functional groups.

53
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,640
So in this top one, our
functional groups are on

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,370
opposite sides.

55
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,080
They're apart.

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,770
They're on opposite sides of the
carbon-carbon double bond.

57
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,130
This is on the top, This
is on the bottom.

58
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,480
In this molecule right here, our
functional groups are on

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,210
the same side.

60
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,720
So when our functional groups
are on different sides, we

61
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,400
could call it trans.

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,670
We could call it trans,
literally, I believe, Latin

63
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,760
for, apart, or Latin
for opposite.

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,160
I'm not a Latin scholar,
so forgive me.

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,010
But the functional groups
are apart, so we call it

66
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,260
trans-but-2-ene.

67
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,060
   

68
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,100
The other convention to use
comes from the German forepart

69
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,760
and there we call it entgegen.

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,360
And instead of writing out
entgegen, we write E in

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,200
parentheses.

72
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,990
So we would call them-- let me
just use different colors

73
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,120
since this molecule
down here is blue.

74
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,095
So we would call this
(E)-but-2-ene.

75
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:11,920
   

76
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,560
These mean the same thing.

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,190
(E)-but-2-ene.

78
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,130
But this is now kind of the
standard convention.

79
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,140
We'll see this notation where
you use entgegen, or (E), is

80
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,300
actually more powerful.

81
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,600
It can extend to when we have
more than one functional group

82
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,510
on each carbon.

83
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,020
Let me just make it clear that
the (E) stands for entgegen,

84
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:39,250
which is German for apart, or
at least I believe it is.

85
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,260
I can't speak German so I'll
just have to take people's

86
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,280
words for it.

87
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,870
Now, in this situation where our
functional groups are on

88
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:50,970
the same side, you could call
this cis-but-2-ene.

89
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,940
Cis, I believe, comes from the
Latin for together, or you

90
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,190
could call it (Z)-but-2-ene.

91
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,760
   

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,310
And you could imagine
this (Z) comes from

93
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,820
the German for together.

94
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:20,910
And it stands for zusammen,
which is German for together.

95
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,190
And that's all you have to do.

96
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,060
And in the next few videos,
we'll do a bunch of examples

97
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,010
here so we can really figure out
whether to label something

98
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,060
with either an (E) or a (Z).

99
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,960
But I wanted expose you to the
cis- and trans- naming scheme,

100
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,490
because that's sometimes used
for simpler molecules where

101
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,550
you only have one functional
group on each side.

102
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,880
But I want you to realize that
they're really trying to make

103
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,760
the same differentiation.

104
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,190
They're really just trying to
decide whether the functional

105
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,340
groups on one side of a double
bond and on the other side of

106
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,460
a double bond, whether they're
on the same side, cis-, or

107
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,860
(Z), or zusammen, or on
different sides, trans- or

108
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,110
(E), or entgegen.

109
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,534
