1
00:00:00,685 --> 00:00:01,919
Let's say last year

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,205
I put $100 into some type of savings account in a bank.

3
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:09,937
So this is a year ago,

4
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:12,830
and that now today, exactly 1 year later,

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,485
that $100 has grown to $110.

6
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,449
So this is now.

7
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:23,695
So if you look at things just in the absolute dollar terms,

8
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:25,543
things have grown by $10,

9
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:31,995
so I made $10 off of an original $100 investment,

10
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:35,475
so I got a 10% return.

11
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:37,343
But what I want to think about is,

12
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:38,917
does this really capture

13
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:41,813
how much more I can buy with this $110

14
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:43,483
than I could buy with that $100 before?

15
00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:47,770
Can I really buy 10% more goods and services today

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,859
than I could a year ago?

17
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:50,881
and to think about that,

18
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:53,359
let's think about, well, a hypothetical inflation rate

19
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,952
from last year to this year,

20
00:00:54,952 --> 00:01:00,675
so let's say that the inflation ended up being 2%

21
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:03,003
between a year ago and today.

22
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:04,025
If that's the case,

23
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:12,296
what is $100 a year ago in today's money?

24
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:14,747
Well, if inflation was 2%,

25
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:18,448
then $100 a year ago would buy you the same stuff

26
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:21,764
that $102 would buy you today,

27
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:24,442
So it would be $102.

28
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:33,105
So what is the dollar return in today's money?

29
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:36,241
In the current, in today's money?

30
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,308
The current purchasing power?

31
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,660
Well, we're getting $110

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,400
We get $110

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,646
and we invest it in today's money, $102.

34
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:48,154
If we look at it from today's terms

35
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:49,472
we invested something that gives us

36
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:52,554
the same purchasing power as $102 today

37
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:56,192
and now it's giving us the purchasing power of $110.

38
00:01:56,192 --> 00:01:59,698
So we've gotten $8 more of purchasing power

39
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:01,481
in today's money.

40
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:06,151
So what is the actual real return?

41
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,644
Let me write it... Real return

42
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:10,434
and we can do it in today's money

43
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:12,233
and you could do it either way,

44
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:15,537
you could discount the $110 back to a year ago money

45
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:17,379
and figure out the real return there

46
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,807
and figuring out the actual dollar return

47
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,247
and do the calculation

48
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:23,423
or you can do it in today's money

49
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:25,439
and maybe I'll do it the previous way in the next video.

50
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,471
But the real return is

51
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:31,270
we made $8 over the course of the year

52
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,637
in today's money

53
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:35,230
and what we originally invested in today's money

54
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,472
was $102.

55
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:40,780
And so we get our calculator out

56
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:47,523
8 divided by 102 is 7.8%

57
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:51,674
so this is equal to 7.8%

58
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:55,054
So even though the nominal return,

59
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:57,694
if we just look at what we got in exchange

60
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,328
for what we invested

61
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:02,354
even though the nominal return was 10%

62
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:04,820
because there was 2% inflation

63
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,951
our actual purchasing power only increased by 7.8%
