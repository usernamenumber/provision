1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:05,025
The perimeter of Tina's rectangular garden is 60 feet.

2
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:09,708
If the length of the garden is twice the width - the length is twice the width -

3
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:12,585
what are the dimensions of the garden?

4
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:14,977
So, let's draw this garden here: Tina's garden.

5
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:18,742
So it's a rectangle - they tell us that it's a rectangular garden -

6
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:21,399
So, it looks something like this.

7
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,347
And let's say that this is the width.

8
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:25,971
So if this is the width, then this is also going to be the width.

9
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:27,733
And this is the length up here.

10
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:31,430
And they tell us that the length of the garden is twice the width.

11
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:35,154
So, if this is w, then the length is going to be 2w.

12
00:00:35,154 --> 00:00:36,825
It's going to be twice the width.

13
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:40,664
This is also going to be 2w over here.

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,841
Now, what's the perimeter of this garden?

15
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:47,678
Well, it's going to be w+w+2w+2w - let me write this down -

16
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:56,924
The perimeter of this garden is going to be w+2w+w+2w,

17
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,247
which is equal to what?

18
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:01,185
This is w plus 2w is 3w -

19
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:05,367
4w, 6w. So this is equal to 6w.

20
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,120
That's the perimeter in terms of the width.

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,948
They also tell us that the actual numerical value of the perimeter is 60 feet -

22
00:01:14,948 --> 00:01:16,775
it is 60 feet.

23
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:23,600
So, this perimeter 6w must be equal to 60 if we're assume that we're dealing with feet.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,161
So, we just have the equation 6w=60.

25
00:01:27,178 --> 00:01:29,873
We can divide both sides of this equation by 6,

26
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:33,462
so that we have just a w on the left hand side.

27
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:35,831
6w divided by 6 is just w

28
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:39,038
and then 60 divided by 6 is 10.

29
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:41,745
So, we have w=10.

30
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:44,548
So this, the width of the garden is 10.

31
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:46,808
So, this distance over here is 10.

32
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:49,052
And then, what is the length of the garden?

33
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:50,723
Well, it's two times the width.

34
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:52,965
So, this is equal to 20.

35
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:56,435
The length is equal to 20.

36
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:57,520
And so, we're done.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,643
This is a 20 by 10 garden.
