00:00:00,278 --> 00:00:02,444
What we're going to do in this video

2
00:00:02,444 --> 00:00:04,292
is generalize what we did in the last video.

3
00:00:04,292 --> 00:00:06,074
And, essentially, end up with the formula

4
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:08,213
for rotating something around the X-axis like this using,

5
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:11,565
what we call, the "disk method".

6
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:16,165
And the point is to show you where that formula inside a calculus textbook actually comes from.

7
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:18,879
But it just comes from the same exact principles we did in the last video!

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:26,086
It's not advised to memorize the formula; I highly recommend against that because you really need to know what's going on.

9
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:29,082
It's really better to do it in first principles where you find

10
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:31,613
the volume of each of these disks.

11
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:34,901
But let's just generalize what we saw in the last video.

12
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,612
So instead of saying that "y = x^2",

13
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:43,281
let's just say that this is the graph, the function that's right over here.

14
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:46,715
Let's just generalize it and call it "y=f(x)".

15
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:48,814
And instead of saying x is going from 0 to 2

16
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:57,445
let's say that we're going between a and b, so these are just two endpoints along the X-axis.

17
00:00:57,445 --> 00:00:59,762
So how would we find the volume of this?

18
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:04,629
Well, just like the last video, we still take a disk just like this.

19
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,662
But what is the height of the disk?

20
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:09,626
The height of the disk is not just x^2 since we've generalized it.

21
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:12,597
So the height is simply going to be whatever the height of the function is at that point.

22
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:16,808
So the height of the disk is going to be f(x)!

23
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:24,532
The area of the space of this disk is going to be πR^2.

24
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:29,440
So our radius is f(x), and we're just going to square it.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,591
That's the area, that's the area of this face right over here.

26
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:34,391
What is the volume of the disk?

27
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:39,875
We're just going to multiply that by our depth, which going to be dx.

28
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,795
And we want to take the sum of all of these disks from a to b,

29
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:50,127
and we're going to take the sum of them, and we're going to take the limit as the "dx"s get smaller and smaller.

30
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,911
And we have an infinite number of these disks.

31
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:58,290
Thus, we are going to the integral of this from a to b!

32
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:06,367
And this right here is the formula that you will see often in a calculus textbook for using the disk method as you're rotating around the X-axis.

33
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:12,834
So I just wanted to show you that it comes out of the common sense of finding the volume of this disk.

34
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:18,002
The f(x) right over here is just the radius of the disk, so this part over here is really just πR^2;

35
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:24,510
we multiply it [area of the circle] times the depth; then we take the sum from a to b of all of the disks.

36
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,510
And essentially since this is integral is the limit of all the disks getting narrower and narrower. And thus, we have an infinite number of these disks.
