1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Let's say I have some object that's traveling in a circular path just like this.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,690
And what I've drawn here is its velocity vector at different points along that path.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,220
So this right over here is going to be v one, velocity vector one,

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,030
and this is going to be velocity vector two,

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,440
and this right over here is going to be velocity vector three.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,820
and we're going to assume in this video is the magnitude

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,800
of the velocity vectors is constant or another way to think about this

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,260
is that the speed is constant.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,510
So I'll just say, lower case V without the arrow on

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,020
top so this is going to be a scaler quantity, I'll call this the speed

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,720
or you could call this the magnitude of these vectors, and

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,110
this is going to be constant, so this is going to be

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,600
equal to the magnitude of vector one, which is equal to the magnitude of vector two.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,590
The direction is clearly changing but the magnitude is going to be the same, which is

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,640
equal to the magnitude the magnitude of vector three

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,850
We're going to assume that it is traveling in a path, a circle with radius r.

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,960
What I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a position vector at each point

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:18,110
Let's call r one, over there; that's position vector one, r one.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,070
That is position vector r two.

20
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,000
So the position is clearly changing, that's position vector r two,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,100
and that is position vector r three

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,690
but the magnitude of our position vectors are clearly the same,

23
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,940
and I'm going to call the magnitude of out position vectors, r.

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,300
That's just the radius of the circle; it's this distance right over here.

25
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,110
So R is equal to the magnitude of R one, which is equal to the magnitude of R two,

26
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,970
which is equal to the magnitude of R three.

27
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,670
Now what I what to do in this video is to prove to you visually that

28
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:59,750
given this radius and given this speed that the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration,

29
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,510
and I'll just write that as A, sub C.

30
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,650
I don't have an arrow on top, so this is an scalar quantity.

31
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,170
So the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration, is going to be

32
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:14,940
equal to our speed squared, our constant speed squared, divided by,

33
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,870
divided by the radius of the circle this is what I want you

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,600
I want you to feel good that this is indeed the case by the end of this video.

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,590
And to understand that, what I want to do, is I want to re-plot these

36
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,730
these velocity vectors on another circle,

37
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,780
and just think about how the vectors themselves are changing.

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:43,500
So let's copy and paste this, so let me copy and paste V one, so copy and paste so that is V

39
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,900
actually and want to do it from the center, so that is V one,

40
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:56,230
the same thing for V two. So, let me copy and paste it. That is V two

41
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,950
and then let me do it also for V three.

42
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,630
So, V three I'll just get the vector part of the label. So, copy and paste it.

43
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,190
That right over there is vector, V three and let me clean this up a little bit.

44
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,770
just do that we don't, so that's clearly Vtwo, I don't think we have to label anymore

45
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,750
we know that Vtwo is in orange, we know that Vtwo is in orange.

46
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,200
And what is the radius of this circle going to be right over here?

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,700
Well, the radius of this circle is going to be the magnitude of the velocity vectors,

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,080
and we already know the magnitude of the velocity vectors is this quantity V. The scaler quantity.

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,630
So the radius of this circle is V,

50
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:44,220
the radius of this circle we already know is equal to R.

51
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:52,170
And just as the velocity vectors, what's giving us the change in position vector over time.

52
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,850
What's the vector that's going to give us the change in our velocity vector over time?

53
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,040
Well that's going to be our acceleration vectors.

54
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:08,640
So you will have some acceleration we will call this A1, we will call this A2

55
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,730
And I'll call this A3

56
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,850
and I want to make sure you get the analogy that's going on here.

57
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,170
As we go around the circle the position vector, first they point out to the left,

58
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:27,510
then the upper, up, kind of the 11:00 position or I guess the top, the top left, then to the top

59
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,110
So it's pointing to these different positions like a hand in a clock.

60
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,390
And what's moving it along there, is

61
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,920
the change in the position vector over time which are these velocity vectors.

62
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,700
Over here the velocity vectors are moving around like the hands of a clock.

63
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:49,040
And what is doing the moving around, are these acceleration vectors

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,150
and over here the velocity vectors,

65
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,060
they are tangential to the radius, or sorry, they are tangential to

66
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,030
the path which is a circle, they are perpendicular to the radius.

67
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,120
you learn that in geometry,

68
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,320
that a line that is tangent to a circle is perpendicular to a radius

69
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,000
and it is also going to be the same thing right over here.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,740
And just going back to what we learned,

71
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,070
when we learned about the intuition of centripetal acceleration

72
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,030
if you look at A1 right over here and you translate

73
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,010
this vector it will be going just like that, it will be going towards the center.

74
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,820
A2, once again is going towards the center.

75
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,850
A3, if you translate that, that is going towards the center.

76
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,100
So all of these are actually center seeking vectors, you see that right over here.

77
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,110
So all of these are actually centripetal acceleration vectors right over here.

78
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,580
Here we're talking about just the magnitude of it.

79
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,970
And we are going to assume that these all have the same

80
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,450
magnitude, so we are going to assume that our centripetal,

81
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,460
they all have a magnitude of what we call A sub C. So that's the magnitude,

82
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,210
it's equal to the magnitude of A1, that vector it's equal to the magnitude of A2,

83
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,290
and it's equal to the magnitude of A3.

84
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:03,740
Now, what I want to think about is how long is it going to take to get to

85
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,420
this point on this circle to the point on that circle right over there.

86
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,580
So, the way to think about it is, what is the length of the arc that it traveled.

87
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,880
The length of this arc that it traveled right over there that's 1/4 around the circle

88
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,620
it's going to be 1/4 of the circumference.

89
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,530
The circumference is 2pi(r) it is going to be 1/4 of that.

90
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,040
So, that is the length of the arc, that is the length of the arc.

91
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,250
and then how long will it take to go that?

92
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,140
Well you would divide the length of your path divided by the actual speed,

93
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,670
the actual thing that's nudging it along that path so you want to divide

94
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,740
that by your actual, the magnitude of your velocity or your speed.

95
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,830
This is the magnitude of velocity, not velocity.

96
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,250
This is not a vector right over here, this is a scaler.

97
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,990
So this is going to be the time, the time to travel along that path.

98
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,630
Now, the time to travel along this path is going to be

99
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,710
exact the same amount of time it takes to travel along this path.

100
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,560
For the velocity vector,

101
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,130
so this is for the position vector to travel like that,

102
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,690
this is for the velocity vector to travel like that.

103
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,830
so we can set these two things equally to each other, so we get on this side we get

104
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:29,310
1/4 2(pi)r over V is equal to 1/4 2(pi)V over the magnitude of our acceleration vector

105
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,270
and now we can simplify it a little bit. We can divide both sides by 1/4 get rid of that.

106
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,210
We can divide both sides by 2pi, get rid of that.

107
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:43,440
Let me re-write it, so then we get r/V is equal to V over the centripetal acceleration.

108
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,250
And now you can cross-multiply,

109
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:51,720
and so you get v times v so I'm just multiplying, cross multiplying over here

110
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,350
V times V you get Vsquared is equal to AC times R.

111
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,830
Cross-multiplying remember is just the same thing

112
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,430
as multiplying both sides by both denominators.

113
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,170
By multiplying both sides times V and AC

114
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,250
times V and AC, so it's not some magical thing,

115
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,840
if you multiply both sides times V and AC these V'a cancel

116
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:22,360
out, these AC's cancel out, you get V times V is Vsquared is equal to A sub C times R.

117
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,780
And now to solve for the magnitude of our centripetal acceleration,

118
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,350
you just divide both sides by r.

119
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,400
And I guess we've earned the drumroll now

120
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,500
We're left with the magnitude of our centripetal acceleration.

121
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,030
It's equal to the constant magnitude of our velocity, i.e. our speed

122
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,200
divided by the radius of the circle and we're done
