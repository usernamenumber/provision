1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,800
Let's do another problem.

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,430
Very similar to the last one,
but with a subtle difference.

4
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,860
And that subtle difference
will make a big difference.

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,050
Let's say we take the line
integral over some curve c--

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,590
I'll define the curve in a
second-- of x squared plus y

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:25,420
squared dx plus 2xy dy-- and
this might look very familiar.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,000
This was very similar to what
we saw last time, except last

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,520
time we had a closed
line integral.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,550
This is not a closed
line integral.

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:37,560
And our curve, c, the
parameterization is x is

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,080
equal to cosine of t, y
is equal to sine of t.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,480
So far-- it looks like sit.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,020
Let me write sine of t-- so
far, it looks very similar to

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,800
the closed line integral
example we did in the last

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,120
video, but instead of t going
from 0 to 2 pi, we're going

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,570
to have t go from 0 to pi.

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,180
t is greater than or equal to
0, is less than or equal to pi.

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,650
So now we're essentially, our
path-- if I were to draw it on

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,420
the x-y plane-- so that is my
y-axis, that is my x-axis.

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,130
So now our path isn't all the
way around the unit circle.

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,120
Our path-- our curve c now--
just starts at t is equal to 0.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,120
You can imagine t is
almost the angle.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,950
t is equal to 0, and we're
going to go all the way to pi.

25
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,970
So that's what our path is
right now, in this example.

26
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,330
So it's not a curved path.

27
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,830
It's not a closed path.

28
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,270
So we can't just show that f,
in this example-- and we're

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,580
going to re-look at what f
looks like-- hey, if that's a

30
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,370
conservative vector field, if
it's a closed loop that equals

31
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,920
0, this isn't a closed loop.

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,970
So we can't apply that.

33
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,510
But let's see if we can apply
some of our other tools.

34
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,720
So like we saw in the last
video, this might look a

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,800
little bit foreign to you.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,040
But if you say that f is equal
to that times i, plus that

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,140
times j, then it might look
a little bit more familiar.

38
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,230
If we say that f of xy-- the
vector field f is equal to x

39
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:15,500
squared plus y squared times i
plus 2xy times j and dr-- I

40
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,980
don't even have to look at this
right now. dr, you can always

41
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:24,230
write it as dx times
i plus dy times j.

42
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,720
You'll immediately see, if you
take the dot product of these 2

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,330
things, if you take f dot dr--
they're both vector valued,

44
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,150
vector valued differential,
vector valued field, or vector

45
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,760
valued function-- if you take f
dot dr, you'll get

46
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,460
this right here.

47
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,820
You'll get what we have
inside of the interval.

48
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,270
You'll get that
right there, right?

49
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,120
That times that-- you take
the product of the i terms--

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,290
that times that is equal to
that, and add it to the

51
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,360
product of the j terms.

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,080
2xy times dy.

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,820
Write like that.

54
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,000
So our integral, we can
rewrite it as this.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,650
Along this curve of f dot
dr, where this is our f.

56
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,000
Now, we still might want
to ask ourselves, is this

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,680
a conservative field?

58
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,010
Or does it have a potential?

59
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:17,650
Is f equal to the gradient of
some function, capital F?

60
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,810
I guess I could write the
gradient like that, because

61
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,860
it creates a vector.

62
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,390
This is a vector, too.

63
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,650
Is this true?

64
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,040
And we saw in the
last video, it is.

65
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,600
I'll redo it a little
bit fast this time.

66
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,830
Because if this is true, we
can't say this is a closed

67
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,950
loop and say, oh, it's just
going to be equal to 0.

68
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,330
But if this is true, then we
know that this-- that the

69
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,660
integral is path independent.

70
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:44,040
   

71
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,450
And we'll know that this is
going to be equal to capital F,

72
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,780
if we say that t is going
from-- well, in this case t is

73
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,000
going from 0 to pi-- we could
say that this is going to be

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,490
equal to capital F of pi
minus capital F of 0.

75
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,910
Or if we want to write it in
terms of x and y-- because f is

76
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,150
going to be a function of x and
y-- we could write-- and this

77
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,195
right here, these are t's.

78
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:13,000
   

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,290
We could also write that this
is equal to f of x of pi, y of

80
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:31,020
pi, minus f of x of 0, y of 0.

81
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,830
That's what I mean
when I say f of pi.

82
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,070
If we were to write f
purely as a function of t.

83
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,310
But we know that this capital
F is going to be a function.

84
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,960
It's a scalar function
defined on xy.

85
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,060
So we could say f of
x of pi, y of pi.

86
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,460
These are the t's now.

87
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,920
These are all
equivalent things.

88
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,090
So if it is path dependent,
we can find our f.

89
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,420
We can just evaluate this
thing by just taking our

90
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,970
f, evaluating it at
these two points.

91
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,770
At this point, and at
that point right there.

92
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,040
Because it would be
path independent.

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,130
If this is a conservative, if
this has a potential function,

94
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,090
if this is the gradient of
another scalar field, then this

95
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,790
is a conservative vector field,
and its line integral

96
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,750
is path independent.

97
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,710
It's only dependent on that
point and that point.

98
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,750
So let's see if we
can find our f.

99
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,670
So I'm going to do exactly what
we did in the last video.

100
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,400
If you watch that last
video, it might be a

101
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,090
little bit monotonous.

102
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,540
But I'll do it a little
bit faster here.

103
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,430
So we know that the partial of
f with respect to x is going to

104
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,310
have to be equal to
this right here.

105
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,690
So that's x squared
plus y squared.

106
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,050
Which tells us, if we take the
antiderivative, with respect to

107
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,420
x, then f of xy is going to
have to be equal to x to the

108
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,510
third over 3 plus xy squared--
right? y squared is just a

109
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,830
constant in terms of
x-- plus f of y.

110
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,640
There might be some function
of y that, when you take

111
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,480
the partial with respect
to x, it just disappears.

112
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,980
And then we know that the
partial of f with respect to

113
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,140
y has got to be equal to
that thing or that thing.

114
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,070
We're saying that this
is the gradient of f.

115
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,670
So this has to be the
partial with respect to y.

116
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,230
2xy.

117
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,430
And you might want to
watch the other video.

118
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,540
I go through this just a little
bit slower in that one.

119
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,410
So the antiderivative of this
with respect to y-- so we get f

120
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:29,050
of xy-- would be equal to xy
squared plus some

121
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,770
function of x.

122
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,590
Now we did this in
the last video.

123
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,590
These 2 things have to be the
same thing, in order for the

124
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,520
gradient of capital F
to be lowercase f.

125
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,350
And we have xy
squared, xy squared.

126
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,180
We have a function of x, we
have a function purely of x.

127
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,860
And then we don't have a
function purely of y here,

128
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,090
so this thing right
here must be 0.

129
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,560
So we've solved.

130
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,250
Our capital F of xy must
be equal to x to the 3

131
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,660
over 3 plus xy squared.

132
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,120
So we know that lowercase f
is definitely conservative.

133
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,200
It is path independent.

134
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,350
It has its potential.

135
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,750
It is the gradient of
this thing right here.

136
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,970
And so to solve our integral--
this was a 0-- to solve our

137
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,470
integral, we just have to
figure out x of pi, y

138
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,970
of pi, x of 0, y of 0.

139
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,140
Evaluate the bullet points,
and then subtract the 2.

140
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,400
So let's do that.

141
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,630
So x was cosine of
t, y is sine of t.

142
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,160
Let me rewrite it down here.

143
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,880
So x is equal to cosine of t.

144
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,360
y is equal to sine of t.

145
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,600
So x of 0 is equal to cosine
of 0, which is equal to 1.

146
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,400
x of pi is equal to cosine of
pi, which is equal to minus 1.

147
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,960
y of 0 is sine of
0, which is 0.

148
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,870
y of pi, which is equal to sine
of pi, which is equal to 0.

149
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,140
So f of x of pi, y of pi--
this is the same thing,

150
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,970
so let me rewrite this.

151
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,560
Our integral is simplified to--
our integral along that path of

152
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:26,130
f dot dr-- is going to be equal
to capital F of x of pi.

153
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,620
x of pi is minus 1.

154
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,730
y of pi is equal to 0.

155
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:48,730
Minus capital F of x of 0
is 1, comma y of 0 is 0.

156
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,950
And so what is this equal to?

157
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,160
Just remember, this right
here is the same thing

158
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,810
is that right there.

159
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,150
That is x of pi.

160
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,400
That is y of pi.

161
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,100
That term right there.

162
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,250
You can imagine this whole f of
minus 1, 0-- that's the same

163
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,970
thing as f of pi, if you
think in terms of just t.

164
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,420
That could be a little
confusing, so I want

165
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,410
to make that clear.

166
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,440
So this is just
straightforward to evaluate.

167
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,940
What is f of minus 1, 0?

168
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,780
x is minus 1. y is 0.

169
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,410
So it's going to be minus 1
to the third power-- right,

170
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,700
that's our x-- over 3.

171
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,960
So it's minus 1/3.

172
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,700
It's going to be minus 1/3
plus minus 1 times 0 squared.

173
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,360
So that's just going to be a 0.

174
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,830
In both cases, the y is 0.

175
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,540
So this term is
going to disappear.

176
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,950
So we can ignore that.

177
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:42,000
And then we have minus
f of 1, comma 0.

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,760
We put a 1 here.

179
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,730
1 to the third over 3.

180
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,640
That is 1/3 plus 1
times 0 squared.

181
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,430
That's just 0.

182
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,640
So this is going to be
equal to minus 1/3.

183
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,990
Minus 1/3 is equal
to minus 2/3.

184
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,070
And we're done.

185
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,220
And once again, because this is
a conservative vector field,

186
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,620
and it's path independent, we
really didn't have to mess with

187
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,180
the cosine of t's and sines of
t's when we actually took

188
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,130
our antiderivative.

189
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,425
We just have to find the
potential function and evaluate

190
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:14,590
it at the 2 end points to get
the answer of our integral, of

191
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,170
our line integral, minus 2/3.

192
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,066
