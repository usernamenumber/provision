1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,480
We have three lines and we have
to figure out which of

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,210
the three are parallel.

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,250
So line A-- and it can't be
parallel on its own, it has to

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,510
be parallel to another
of the three lines.

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,740
So the equation for line
A is y is equal

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,080
to 3/4 x minus four.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:29,940
Line B is 4y minus 20 is
equal to negative 3x.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:38,580
And then line C is negative
3x plus 4y is equal to 40.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,090
So to figure out if any of these
lines are parallel to

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,450
any of the other lines,
we just have to

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,210
compare their slopes.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,420
If any two of these lines have
the same slope and they're

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,110
different lines, they have
different y-intercepts, then

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,910
they're going to be parallel.

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,970
Now line A, it's very easy
to figure out its slope.

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,980
It's already in slope-intercept
form.

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,910
This is mx plus b, the slope
is 3/4 and the y-intercept,

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,880
which isn't as relevant when
you're figuring out parallel

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,190
lines, is negative 4.

21
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,180
So let's see what the other
character's slopes are.

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,180
This isn't in any kind
of standard form.

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,100
It's not a standard form,
slope-intercept, or

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,380
point-slope form, but let's
see what the slope

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,300
of this line is.

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,900
So to get it into
slope-intercept form, which is

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,050
really the easiest one to pick
out the slope from, let's add

28
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,535
20 to both sides of
this equation.

29
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:28,800
   

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,240
The left-hand side, those cancel
out, that was the whole

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,650
point, you get 4y is equal
to negative 3x plus 20.

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,670
And now we can divide
everything by 4.

33
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,770
   

34
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:53,520
We are left with y is equal
to negative 3/4 x plus 5.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,130
So in this case, y-intercept
is 5, but most importantly,

36
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,330
the slope is negative 3/4, so
it's different than this guy.

37
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,090
This is negative 3/4, this is
positive 3/4, so these two

38
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,360
guys definitely aren't
parallel.

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,310
Let's move on of this guy
in standard form.

40
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,250
So let's get the x term
on the other side.

41
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,730
So let's add 3x to both sides
of this equation.

42
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,590
   

43
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,130
Left-hand side, these
cancel out.

44
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,800
We're just left with 4y is equal
to 3x plus 40, or 40

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,620
plus 3x, either way.

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,820
Now we can divide both sides
by 4 you have to divide

47
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,980
every term by 4.

48
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,450
The left-hand side, you're
left with y.

49
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,720
The right-hand side, you
have 3/4 x plus 10.

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,600
So here, our slope is 3/4 and
our y-intercept, if we care

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,240
about it, is 10.

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,590
So this line and this line have
the exact same slope,

53
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,560
3/4, and they're different
lines because their

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,280
y-intercept is different.

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,480
So we know that A and C are
parallel lines and B is not

56
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,220
parallel to either one
of the other two.

57
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:02,666
