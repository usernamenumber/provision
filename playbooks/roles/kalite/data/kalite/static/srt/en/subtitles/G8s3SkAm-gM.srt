1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,950
We're on problem 12

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:12,780
0.1 plus 0.1 squared plus 0.1 to the third

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,640
So that's the same thing as 0.1

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,910
What's 0.1 squared?

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,350
It's 1 times 1 with 2 numbers to the right of the decimal

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,750
so it's 0.01

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,340
And then to the third power

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,210
You're just going to end up 1/10 of that, right?

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,040
0.01 times 0.1

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,860
Well that's 1 with 3 numbers to the right

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,020
of the decimal point

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,290
If I'm going to add them all up, I get 1, 1, 1

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,490
And that is answer B

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,510
They're making sure you can multiply your decimals

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,840
Problem 13

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,210
If you have trouble with decimals

17
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,330
you might want to get on the Khan Academy--

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,300
the actual application, it's free--

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,450
and just work through the basic arithmetic

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,600
because we have actually a bunch of things on multiplying

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,190
decimals and stuff

22
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,190
You have to start at 1 plus 1

23
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,200
but it makes sure you don't have any holes in your knowledge

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,520
It eventually gets to algebra and trigonometry and calculus

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,650
You might find that useful

26
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,140
Anyway, question 13

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,990
A carpenter constructed a rectangular sandbox

28
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,700
with a capacity of 10 cubic feet

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,870
If the carpenter were to make a similar box twice as long--

30
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:17,950
2 times length-- twice as wide-- 2 times width--

31
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,960
and twice as high as the first sandbox

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,160
what would be the capacity

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,400
in cubic feet of the second sandbox?

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,980
So you might want to visualize it, right?

35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,730
The best way to visualize it is probably

36
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,310
how many of the old ones could fit?

37
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,710
So if this was one of the old ones

38
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,390
and now I'm going to make a new one that's 2 times the size

39
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,880
in every dimension, right?

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,330
That's 2 times the height

41
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:51,230
So essentially, I could increase the width by 2

42
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,030
Increase the depth by 2, or whatever you want to call it

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,480
Right?

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,580
And then I'm going to increase the height by 2

45
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,840
And I'm going to have trouble drawing

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,940
So how many of the original sandboxes--

47
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,910
that's what they want to know--

48
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,820
how many of the original sandboxes essentially

49
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,250
could fit into the new one?

50
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,910
Well, 2 in 1 direction times 2 times 2

51
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,320
So 2 times 2 times 2 is equal to 8

52
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,390
So another way to think of it

53
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,120
you could view the old sandbox as almost a unit

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,270
like one cubic unit sandbox

55
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,800
And now we're going to go 2 in every direction

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,460
So we could fit 8 of the old sandboxes into the new one

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,010
So 8 times that is equal to 80 cubic feet

58
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,330
which is choice D

59
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,950
Question 14

60
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,250
And these, at least so far

61
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,810
I think these are on the easier end

62
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,560
They'll probably get harder

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,230
but so far they're a lot

64
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,720
faster than the data sufficiency ones

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,840
Which of the following cannot be a value of 1

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,960
over x minus 1?

67
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,730
And I think this is one of the ones

68
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,300
where we have to look at the choices

69
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,070
1

70
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,890
Negative 1

71
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,060
So can we pick x so this is negative 1?

72
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,580
Well sure, if x is equal to 0

73
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,470
1 divided by negative 1 is negative 1

74
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,860
So it's not negative 1 because that can be a value for that

75
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,100
0

76
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,620
Well, this is interesting

77
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,700
How can we ever make this equal to 0?

78
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,580
The only way we can get this close to 0 is

79
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,340
if the denominator becomes a really huge number, right?

80
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,610
But it'll never be equal to 0

81
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,360
It'll just be a really, really, really small fraction

82
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,270
This approaches 0 as x approaches infinity

83
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,540
But this will never equal 0

84
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,940
So the answer is B

85
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,020
All of the other things are completely possible

86
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,920
You just have to realize, you should just see choice B

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,110
and is like, how could this ever equal 0?

88
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,640
Because the numerator is never equaling 0

89
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,820
This can only approach 0

90
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,740
if the denominator gets really really, really big

91
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,910
It will just become a really small fraction

92
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,450
But it'll never, ever equal 0

93
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,430
And you could even try

94
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,080
1 over x minus 1 is equal to 0

95
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,990
You can try to solve it

96
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,510
If you multiply both sides by x minus 1

97
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,880
you get 1 is equal to 0

98
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,620
It's impossible

99
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,260
Undefined

100
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,880
15

101
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,130
A bakery opened yesterday with a daily

102
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,370
supply of 40 dozen rolls

103
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,360
Half of the rolls were sold by noon

104
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,180
1/2 by noon

105
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,580
And 80% of the remaining rolls were sold between noon

106
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,780
and closing time

107
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:45,310
80% remaining, noon and closing

108
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,520
How many dozen rolls had not been sold

109
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,130
when the bakery closed yesterday?

110
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,220
OK, half sold by noon

111
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,390
So 20 sold by noon

112
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,240
And 20 left

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,110
Right?

114
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,830
And they said 80% of the remaining rolls were sold

115
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,040
between noon and closing time

116
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,000
So we could view it two ways

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,880
If you wanted to do it really fast, you're like, OK

118
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,050
20% of the remaining rolls will not be sold

119
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,670
Right?

120
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,160
So you could say 20% of the remaining rolls--

121
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,820
so times 20-- don't get sold, right?

122
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,630
If 80% get sold, 20% don't get sold

123
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,280
And that equals what?

124
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,700
We could say 20 times 20 is 400

125
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,570
Two spaces behind the decimal point

126
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,100
And that makes sense

127
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,070
20% is 1/5

128
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,100
So 1/5 of 20 is 4

129
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,960
So 4 rolls don't get sold when it closed

130
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,040
You could do it the other way around

131
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,470
You could say, OK, how many sold between

132
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,170
at this time 80% of 20 is 16 more sell

133
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,690
16 sell

134
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,860
And then you can say, OK, how many total were sold?

135
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,830
Well, 20 plus 16, 36

136
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,140
And then 40 minus 36 is also 4

137
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,060
It takes a little bit more time

138
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,950
but it gets you the same answer

139
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,740
Eventually time is what you'll have to focus on

140
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,370
Once you are confident that you can get every problem right

141
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,900
What is the combined area in square inches of the front

142
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,160
and back of a rectangular sheet of paper

143
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,390
measuring 8.5 by 11?

144
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:22,060
So it's essentially going to be 2 times 8.5 times 11

145
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,360
If you just multiplied 8.5 times 11

146
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,850
that would give you the area of one side

147
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,230
So we want the area of both sides

148
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,320
It's going to be 2 times that

149
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,500
And I want to do this first

150
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,740
just so I can get rid of this mixed number

151
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,620
So 8.5 times 2

152
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,670
That's 17, times 11, which is going to be what?

153
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,460
17 times 11 is 170

154
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,260
Because that's 17 times 10, plus 17

155
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,640
So that's 187

156
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,430
That's choice E

157
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,660
Let's do problem 17

158
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,760
150 is what percent of 30?

159
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:05,970
So 150 is equal to x percent of 30 times 30

160
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,910
Or another way we could write that is--

161
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,630
well, let me just write it as a variable

162
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,880
Let's figure it out as a decimal

163
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,120
And then once you know a decmial, it's easy to convert that

164
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,700
So 150 is equal to x of 36 or 36x

165
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,620
This is some number times 36

166
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,230
Divide both sides by 36

167
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,490
You get x is equal to 150/36

168
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,650
Let's see, I think we can divide the top and the bottom

169
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,070
Definitely we can divide them by 6

170
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,960
6 goes into 150 25 times

171
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,280
And it goes into 36 6 times

172
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,120
Right?

173
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,830
Oh wait, what am I doing?

174
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,800
It's 30

175
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,750
My own handwriting got me caught up

176
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,430
This is a much easier problem than what I was doing

177
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,440
They're saying 150 is what percent of 30, right?

178
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,630
So it's x times 30

179
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,910
This is easy

180
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,360
You divide both sides by 30

181
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,200
I mistakenly wrote 36 there

182
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,410
Divide both sides by 30, you get 5 is equal to x, right?

183
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,760
If you wanted to write 5 as a percentage

184
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,890
you just multiply both sides by 100

185
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,420
So you could say x is equal to 500%

186
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,600
And that makes sense

187
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,990
150 is 5 times 30

188
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,770
100% of 30 is 30

189
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,480
200% of 30 is 60

190
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,250
And so forth

191
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,520
So 500% of 30 is 150

192
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,340
That took me too long I think

193
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,520
E

194
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,410
Got to make sure your handwriting is good

195
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,370
Next question

196
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,390
18

197
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:46,230
The ratio 2:1/3 is equal to-- Well, 2 divided by 1/3 is

198
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,630
equal to 2 times 3/1, which is equal to 6/1

199
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,560
So 2:1/3 is the same thing as the ratio of 6:1

200
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,970
which is choice A

201
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,300
Right?

202
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,070
2:1/3 is equal to 6:1

203
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,540
Another way to think about it is 2 is 6 times 1/3

204
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,930
And 6 is 6 times 1

205
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,770
Same thing

206
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,770
So 18 is A

207
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,640
Next question

208
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,060
19

209
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,310
Running at the same constant rate

210
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,620
6 identical machines

211
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:30,020
can produce a total of 270 bottles per minute

212
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,310
At this rate

213
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:37,300
how many bottles could 10 such machines produce in 4 minutes?

214
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,690
OK, so how much does each produce per minute?

215
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:52,260
So 1 machine will produce 270 divided by 6 bottles per minute

216
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,130
Right?

217
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,620
That's one machine

218
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,500
I just divided both sides by 6

219
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,610
6 machines produce that

220
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,270
So 10 machines would produce 10 times as many per minute

221
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:10,390
So 10 times this is 2,700 divided by 6 bottles per minute

222
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,170
And if they want to know how much 10 machines

223
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,410
are going to produce in 4 minutes

224
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,060
you just multiply this times 4

225
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,860
So this is how much they produce in 1 minute

226
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:27,650
so the answer's going to be 2,700 times 4 divided by 6

227
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,710
So let me see if I can do this math fast

228
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,190
So 6 is equal to 2 times 3

229
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:39,960
If you divide 2,700 by 3, that's 900

230
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,110
And 3 divided by 3 is 1

231
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,040
And then 4 divided by 2 is 2

232
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,270
So 900 times 2 is equal to 1,800

233
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,790
And that is choice B

234
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,120
And I'm all out of time

235
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,300
See you in the next video
