1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,200
I'm on problem number seven.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,250
Josephine's daily exercise
routine consists of swimming,

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,720
cycling, and running
in that order.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,660
So swimming, cycling, and
running in that order.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:23,340
She runs faster than she swims,
and cycles faster than

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,990
she runs, like most people.

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,640
   

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,900
If she does not rest between the
activities, which of the

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,580
following could be the graph
of the distance she covers

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,650
during the entire time of
her exercise routine?

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,460
So I'm not going to even
look at the choices.

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,060
And I'll just give you an
intuition and then you can

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,150
look for the choices
that match it.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:52,030
So if I were to graph distance
versus time, the slope of my

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,980
line is going to be
my speed, right?

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,830
Because what is speed?

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,570
It's distance per time.

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,550
And that's the same
thing as slope.

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,320
It's rise over run.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,700
So in this context, that would
be the slope of the line.

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,180
So what you want is a situation
where she swims

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,460
first-- which is her slowest--
then she cycles-- which is her

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,640
fastest-- then she runs-- which
is kind of in between.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,020
So what you're going to have
is a low slope, then a very

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,680
high slope, and then you want
kind of a medium slope.

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,550
So it's going to look
something like this.

28
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,990
Because she swims first, so
that's the slowest exercise,

29
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,050
so maybe it'll be like that.

30
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,693
Then she cycles, which is her
fastest exercise, so maybe it

31
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:28,180
will look something like that.

32
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,250
And then she runs, which is
kind of an in-between

33
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,390
exercise, so maybe it looks
something like this.

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,460
So which of the choices
looks like that?

35
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,630
Where you start relatively
slow, you peak out pretty

36
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,090
fast, and then you do something
that looks a little

37
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,300
bit faster-- that has a higher
slope than this.

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,730
And if I look at all
of the choices, it

39
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,040
looks like choice E.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,230
Choice E is actually pretty
close to what I drew.

41
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,880
If you look at the other
choices, choice A she goes

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,960
slow, then medium, then fast.
So that's like if she cycled

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,630
last, right?

44
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,920
In choice B she does her slow
thing last. That looks like

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,690
she's swimming last. Choice C
looks like she's swimming last

46
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,780
as well, because that's the
slowest. And then choice D

47
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,620
looks like she cycles, then
she swims, then she runs.

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,390
So it's definitely choice E.

49
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,150
You go slow, fast,
and then medium.

50
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,400
Next problem.

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,900
   

52
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,510
Problem eight.

53
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,000
In the xy-coordinate systems,
square root of 6-- sorry, the

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,600
point is square root of 6 comma
k-- is one of the points

55
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,075
of intersection of the graphs.

56
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,820
So these are the graphs.

57
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:49,560
y is equal to x squared minus
7, and y is equal to minus x

58
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,890
squared plus j.

59
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,640
Fair enough.

60
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,860
Where j is a constant.

61
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,930
What is the value of j?

62
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,490
So we know the x-coordinate
where it intersects, right?

63
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,200
We know it intersects
at square root of 6.

64
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,590
So intersection means that the
y values are the same for a

65
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,670
given x value.

66
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,210
That's what intersects.

67
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,810
So we can set these two
equations equal to each other.

68
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,080
So we could say, x squared--
we could set the y values

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,640
equal to each other-- x squared
minus 7 is equal to

70
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,860
this: minus x squared plus j.

71
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,940
Now we could keep things in
terms of x or we could-- well

72
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,690
let's just algebraically play
with this a little bit.

73
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,300
And I hope you understand that
this is what we would do to

74
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,700
solve for the intersection of
these two graphs, if we wanted

75
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,495
to solve for the x value.

76
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:40,960
And we could play with
this a little bit.

77
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,010
We could add x squared
to both sides.

78
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:49,530
You get 2x squared minus
7 is equal to j.

79
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,340
And what's x?

80
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,640
We know where these intersect.

81
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,570
We know one of the points
where they intersect is

82
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,930
square root of 6.

83
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,150
So let's input-- let's replace
x with square root of 6.

84
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,610
So 2 times square root of 6
squared minus 7 is equal to j.

85
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,185
What's the square root
of 6 squared?

86
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,660
It's just 6, right?

87
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,540
So it's 2 times 6 minus
7 is equal to j.

88
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,079
So 12 minus 7 is equal to j.

89
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,810
5 is equal to j.

90
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,250
And that is choice A.

91
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,960
   

92
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,210
Problem nine.

93
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,920
   

94
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,850
If the absolute value of 2 minus
x is less than 3, which

95
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,270
of the following is a
possible value of x?

96
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:51,030
So this means that 2 minus
x is less than 3.

97
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,840
Right?

98
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,950
So I guess the way you can
think about is that the

99
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,070
difference between 2 and
x is going to be

100
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,750
less than 3, right?

101
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,030
The other way you could view
it is that the negative of

102
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:10,920
this-- x minus 2-- is going
to be less than 3.

103
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,520
Right?

104
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,140
We could have also said 2
minus x is greater than

105
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
negative 3.

106
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,470
That's the other thing we
could have written.

107
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,080
And what I did is I just-- this
is either going to be a

108
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,970
positive or a negative, right?

109
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,350
So if it's a positive, we just
say 2 minus x is less than 3.

110
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,030
If x is going to be greater than
2, then we could say that

111
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,930
x minus 2 is less than 3.

112
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,390
Because then it would be a
negative number and then it

113
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,636
would become positive.

114
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:36,420
Hope I didn't confuse you.

115
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,220
So if this is true you would
get-- let's see-- you would

116
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,840
get, if I were to add x to both
sides I'd get 2 is less

117
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,050
than 3 plus x.

118
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,020
Subtract 3 from both sides.

119
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,040
You get negative 1
is less than x.

120
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,360
This one, add 2 to both sides.

121
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,110
You get x is less than 5.

122
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,670
So x is greater than negative
1 and it is less than 5.

123
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:11,840
So if you look at all of the
choices-- it has to be less

124
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,750
than 5 and greater than negative
1-- so out of all of

125
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,170
those choices, the only choice
that is less than 5 is choice

126
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,340
A, which is 4.

127
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,410
And you could look at it.

128
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,990
You could actually just
try out the numbers.

129
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,770
And frankly, even if you got
confused by absolute value,

130
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,250
you could have just tried
each of the choices.

131
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,890
2 minus 4 is minus 2.

132
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,280
The absolute value of negative
2 is just 2, which

133
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,070
is less than 3.

134
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,150
So that's right.

135
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,970
So you could have actually just
tried out the choices if

136
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,620
this confused you.

137
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,160
And that actually might have
been faster because in the

138
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,240
worst case, you'd have to try
out five choices and each of

139
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,770
them would have taken a few
seconds to evaluate.

140
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,700
But sometimes it's good to
do it mathematically.

141
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,840
But I wouldn't wrong you for--
I wouldn't blame you for just

142
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,040
trying things out as well.

143
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,840
Ten.

144
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,560
OK.

145
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,410
If all interior angles of the
polygon are congruent, then x

146
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,450
is equal to-- OK so this
is interesting.

147
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,120
All of the angles of this
polygon are congruent.

148
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,985
So it's a pentagon.

149
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:24,790
So it's 1, 2-- like that--
3, 4, and 5.

150
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,260
I didn't draw really
that congruent.

151
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,395
And actually this line keeps
going like this.

152
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,490
And the important thing to
realize with any of these

153
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,460
triangles is, if I were to
draw-- there's a formula for

154
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,750
the angles of a polygon, but I
always-- so the way to think

155
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:49,920
about it is that these are all
going to be equal angles.

156
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,490
So think of it this way.

157
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,840
These are five equal
triangles.

158
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,990
Let me think of it
the best way.

159
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,880
So they're telling us-- we
want to figure out what x

160
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,050
degrees is, right?

161
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,720
Well this x degrees
is going to be the

162
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,000
same as this x degrees.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,990
   

164
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,080
And how do I know that?

165
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,833
