1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,240
We know what an orthonormal
basis is, but the next obvious

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,160
question is, what are
they good for?

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,100
And one of the many answers to
that question is that they

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,670
make for good coordinate
systems or

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,560
good coordinate bases.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,670
   

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,630
For example, the standard
basis, or the standard

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,270
coordinates-- Let me write
the standard basis in Rn.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:38,160
So if we're dealing with Rn--
So the standard basis for Rn

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,310
is equal to-- Well, I could
write it as e1, e2, and all of

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,280
that, but I'll actually
write out the vectors.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,580
You know, e1 is just 1 with a
bunch of 0's all the way.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,780
And this is going to be n 0's
right there. e2 is going to be

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,600
0, 1 with a bunch of
0's all the way.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,590
And then you're going to go all
the way to en, which is

17
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,550
going to have a bunch of 0's.

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,510
And then you're going
to have a 1.

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,270
The standard basis that we've
been dealing with throughout

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,280
this playlist is an orthonormal
set, is an

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,275
orthonormal basis.

22
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:23,490
Clearly the length of any
of these guys is 1.

23
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,870
If you were to take this guy
dotted with yourself, you're

24
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,410
going to get 1 times 1, plus a
bunch of 0's times each other.

25
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,690
So it's going to
be one squared.

26
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,560
It's going to be 1.

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,210
And that's true of any
of these guys.

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,380
And clearly they're
orthogonal.

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,695
You take the dot product of any
of these guys with any of

30
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:38,870
the other one's, you're going
to get a 1 times 0, and a 1

31
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,970
times 0, and then
a bunch of 0's.

32
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,070
You're going to get 0's.

33
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,590
So they clearly each
have lengths of 1.

34
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,790
And they're all orthogonal.

35
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,740
And clearly, this is a good
coordinate system.

36
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,490
   

37
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,570
But what about other
orthonormal bases.

38
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,210
Obviously this is one specific
example I need to show you

39
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,080
that all orthonormal bases
make for good coordinate

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:09,620
systems. So let's say I have
some set, some orthonormal set

41
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,000
of vectors.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,870
So this is v1, v2, all
the way to vk.

43
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:34,250
And it is an orthonormal basis
for some subspace V.

44
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,810
And this is a k-dimensional
subspace, because you have k

45
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,140
basis vectors in your
basis, or you have k

46
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,290
vectors in your basis.

47
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,730
Now let's experiment with
this a little bit.

48
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm claiming that the coordinate
system, with

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,410
respect to this, is good.

50
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,920
But what does it mean
to be good?

51
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,460
I mean, the standard basis is
good, but, you know, that's

52
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,070
just because we use it and it
seems to be easy to deal with.

53
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,300
But let's see, when
I say good in this

54
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,060
context, what do I mean?

55
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,090
So let's experiment.

56
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,670
If I say that some vector x is a
member of V, that means that

57
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,400
x can be represented as a linear
combination of these

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,890
characters up here.

59
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:20,690
So x can be represented as some
constant times v1, plus

60
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,150
some constant times v2, plus,
you know, the ith constant

61
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,850
times vi, all the way, if you
just keep going, all the way

62
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,690
to the kth constant times vk.

63
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,110
That's what being a member
of the subspace means.

64
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,775
The subspace is spanned by these
guys, so this guy can be

65
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:42,270
represented as a linear
combination of those guys.

66
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,525
Now what happens if we take the
dot product of both sides

67
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,400
of this equation with vi?

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,830
So I'm going to take vi, I'm
going to dot both of these

69
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,250
sides with vi.

70
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,430
So I get vi, dotted with x, is
going to be equal to what?

71
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,990
Well it's going to be-- we could
just put the constants

72
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:07,190
out --it's going to be c1 times
vi, dot v1, plus c2

73
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:16,720
times vi dot v2, plus all the
way to ci, times vi dot vi,

74
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,899
and then you keep going,
plus all the way to ck,

75
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,720
times vi dot vk.

76
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,410
Now, this is an orthonormal
set.

77
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,690
That means, if I take two
vectors that are different

78
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,340
than each other in our basis
right here, that if you take

79
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,140
their dot product, you're
going to get 0.

80
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,980
They're orthogonal
to each other.

81
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,560
So these are two different
vectors in our set.

82
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,340
They're going to be orthogonal,
so this term is

83
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,990
going to be 0.

84
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,690
It's going to be 0 times c1,
so it's going to be 0.

85
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,580
This term is also going to be
0, assuming that i isn't 2.

86
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,250
Let's just assume that.

87
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,375
This term over here, let's
assume that i isn't k.

88
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,480
It's also going to
be equal to 0.

89
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,610
So all of the terms are going
to be 0, except for the case

90
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,820
where v sub i is equal to, well,
in this case, v sub i.

91
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,410
Except for the case where
this subscript is

92
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,810
equal to that subscript.

93
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,420
And then what is v sub
i, dot v sub i?

94
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,100
You know, orthonormal
has two parts.

95
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,560
They're orthogonal to each
other, and they're each

96
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,850
normalized, or they each
have length 1.

97
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,340
So v sub i, dot v sub i, dot
with v sub i is going to be

98
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,630
equal to 1.

99
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,950
So this whole equation has
simplified to v sub i-- which

100
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,620
is one of these guys, it's the
ith member of our basis set

101
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,290
--dot x-- where x is just any
member of the subspace --is

102
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,780
equal to the only thing that's
left over is 1 times ci.

103
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,750
   

104
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,840
So it's just equal to ci.

105
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,710
Now why is this useful?

106
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,300
You know, we were just
experimenting around, and we

107
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,570
got this nice little
result here.

108
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,800
Why is this useful in terms of
having a coordinate system

109
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,650
with respect to this basis?

110
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,910
So let's remind ourselves what
a coordinate system is here.

111
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,160
So if we wanted to represent
the vector x, which is a

112
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,100
member of our subspace, with
coordinates that are with

113
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,050
respect to this basis of the
subspace-- Right, a subspace

114
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,910
can have many bases,
but this is the

115
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,400
basis that we're choosing.

116
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,990
So we want to write x with
respect to the basis B.

117
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,960
What do we do?

118
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,250
The coordinates are just going
to be, the coefficients on the

119
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,830
different basis vectors.

120
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,710
This is all a bit of review.

121
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,350
It's going to be c1, c2, we're
going to go down to ci, and

122
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,550
then you're going all
the way to ck.

123
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,040
You're going to have k terms,
because this is a

124
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,070
k-dimensional subspace.

125
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,570
Now normally this is not such
an easy thing to figure out.

126
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,295
If I give you some vector x-- I
mean, we've seen it before.

127
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:51,960
   

128
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,470
Well, if you have x represented
in B coordinate

129
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,460
system, then you can multiply
it times the change of basis

130
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,830
matrix, and you can just
get regular x.

131
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:10,610
But if have regular x, and you
need to find this, one, if C

132
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,660
is invertible, then you can
apply this equation right

133
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,020
here, which isn't
always the case.

134
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,645
This is only if C
is invertible.

135
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:24,370
   

136
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,880
And, first of all, C will not
always be invertible.

137
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,750
If this isn't a square
matrix, then this

138
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,740
isn't going to apply.

139
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,590
So this is one way that if I
give you your x, to get your B

140
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,040
representation of x.

141
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,730
But if C isn't invertible, then
you're just going to have

142
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,740
to solve this equation.

143
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,690
You're going to have something
on the right hand side here.

144
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,780
You're going to have a change
of basis matrix.

145
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,320
And then you're going to have
to solve that equation.

146
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,960
You know, for an arbitrary
basis, that

147
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,690
can be pretty painful.

148
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,730
But what do we have here?

149
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,210
We have a very simple solution
for finding the different

150
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,030
coordinates of x.

151
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,930
So this is the same thing as
being equal to-- c1 is just

152
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,950
going to be equal to my first
basis vector, dotted with x.

153
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,930
We say ci is just the ith basis
vector dotted with x.

154
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,170
So c1 is going to be the first
basis vector dotted with x.

155
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,570
c2 is going to be my second
basis vector dotted with x.

156
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,640
And you're going to go all the
way down to ck is going to be

157
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,060
my kth basis vector
dotted with x.

158
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,930
And let me show you that this
is actually easier.

159
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,720
So let's do a concrete
example.

160
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,260
I want to leave this
result up here.

161
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,760
Let's say that I have
two vectors.

162
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,640
Let's say that v1 is
the vector 3/5.

163
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,290
Let me write it this way.

164
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:57,180
Let's say it's 3/5 and 4/5.

165
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:06,690
And that v2 is equal
to minus 4/5, 3/5.

166
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,490
   

167
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,640
And let's say that the set B is
equal to-- It's comprised

168
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,460
of just those two vectors,
v1 and v2.

169
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,460
Now, I'm claiming, or I'm about
to claim, that this an

170
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,340
orthonormal set.

171
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,370
Let's just prove it
to ourselves.

172
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,990
So what is the length
of v1 squared?

173
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,260
Well, that's just v1
dotted with itself.

174
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,550
So that's 3/5 squared, which
is 9/25, plus 4/5 squared,

175
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:46,740
which is 16/25, which is equal
to 25/25, which is equal to 1.

176
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,170
So this guy definitely
has length 1.

177
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,760
What is the length
of v2 squared?

178
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,500
Well, it's going to be
this guy squared.

179
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,380
Negative 4/5 squared is 9/25,
plus 3-- Sorry, minus 4/5

180
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,870
squared is plus 16/25.

181
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,500
And then 3/5 squared is 9/25.

182
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,070
And, once again, the length
squared is going to be 1, or

183
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,290
the length is going to be 1.

184
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,470
So both of these guys definitely
have length 1.

185
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,130
And now we just have to verify
that they're orthogonal with

186
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,600
respect to each other.

187
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,940
So what is v1 dot v2?

188
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,570
It's going to be 3/5
times minus 4/5.

189
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:32,610
So it's going to be minus 12/25,
plus 4/5 times 3/5,

190
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,180
which is going to be plus 12/25,
which is equal to 0.

191
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,510
So these guys are definitely
orthogonal with respect to

192
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,770
each other, and their lengths
are 1, so this is definitely

193
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,460
an orthonormal set.

194
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,910
And so that also tells us that
they're linearly independent.

195
00:10:49,910 --> 00:11:04,580
So let's say that my set B is
the basis for some subspace V.

196
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,170
   

197
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,410
And actually, it's not a-- We
don't even have to say that--

198
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,320
it's the basis for R2.

199
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,350
It's a basis for R2.

200
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,960
And how do we know it's
a basis for R2?

201
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,940
I have two linearly independent
vectors in my

202
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,950
basis, and it's spanning a
two-dimensional space, R2, so

203
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,880
this can be a basis
for all of R2.

204
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,100
Now, given what we've seen
already, let's pick some

205
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,320
random member of R2.

206
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,480
So if we pick some random member
of R2, let's say that x

207
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,990
is equal to-- I don't know, I'm
just going to pick some

208
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,040
random numbers --9
and minus 2.

209
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,600
   

210
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,120
If we didn't know this was an
orthonormal basis and we

211
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,550
wanted to figure out x in B's
coordinates, what we would

212
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,730
have to do is we would
have to create the

213
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,690
change of basis matrix.

214
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,110
So the change of basis matrix
would be 3-- let me write it

215
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:13,392
like it would be-- 3/5, 4/5,
minus 4/5, and then 3/5.

216
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:18,780
And we would say that times my B
coordinate representation of

217
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:25,530
x is going to be equal to my
regular representation of x,

218
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,020
or my standard coordinates
of x.

219
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,720
And I would have to solve this 2
by 2 system, and in a 2 by 2

220
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,190
case it's not so bad.

221
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,960
But we have this neat tool here
for orthonormal sets, or

222
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,810
orthonormal bases.

223
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:44,410
So, instead of solving this
equation, we can just say that

224
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:52,700
x represented in B coordinates
is going to be equal to-- let

225
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,620
me scroll down a little bit--
it's going to be equal to v1,

226
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,510
which is this guy right
here, dotted with x.

227
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:05,610
So it's going to be v1 dot x.

228
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,160
And then this guy right here is
just going to be v2 dot x.

229
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,770
And I can do this because this
is an orthonormal basis.

230
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,322
And what is the equal to?

231
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:16,660
x is 9 minus 2.

232
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,850
   

233
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,800
If I dot that with v1,
I get 9 times 3/5,

234
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:32,160
which is 27/5, right.

235
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:44,300
9 times 3 is 27/5, plus minus
2 times 4/5, so that's minus

236
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,240
8/5, right.

237
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,650
Minus 2 times 4/5
is minus 8/5.

238
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,410
   

239
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,790
And then the second
term is v2 dot x.

240
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,010
So v2 dot x.

241
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,000
I get 9 times-- let me scroll
up a little bit-- 9 times

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,970
minus 4/5, that's minus 36/5,
plus minus 2 times 3/5, so

243
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,950
that's plus minus 2 times
3/5 is minus 6/5.

244
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,730
So the B coordinate
representation of x, just

245
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,430
being able to use this property
right here of

246
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,400
orthonormal bases, is equal
to-- What is this?

247
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,610
27 minus 8 is 19/5,
and then minus 36,

248
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,140
minus 6 is minus 42/5.

249
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,150
Not a pretty answer but, you
know, we would have had this

250
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,730
ugly answer either
way we solved it.

251
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,670
But hopefully you see that when
we have an orthonormal

252
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,900
basis, solving for the
coordinates with respect to

253
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,990
that basis becomes
a lot easier.

254
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,220
This is just an example in R2.

255
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,760
You can imagine how difficult
it could be if you start

256
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,760
dealing with, you know, if you
start dealing with R4 or R100.

257
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,020
Then all of a sudden solving
these systems isn't so easy,

258
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,380
but taking dot products are
always fairly straightforward.

259
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,530
So earlier in this video when I
said, orthonormal basis, you

260
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,520
know, what are they good for?

261
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,440
And I said, you know, standard
basis is good.

262
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,800
That these are good coordinates
systems. You've

263
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,990
used it before.

264
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,600
You know, I didn't really put
a lot of context around what

265
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,300
it meant to be good.

266
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,900
But now we see one version
of what it's good for.

267
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:23,850
It's very easy to find
coordinates in an orthonormal

268
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,570
basis, or coordinates
with respect to

269
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,610
an orthonormal basis.
