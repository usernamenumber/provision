1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,159
Let's say this past year I started a restaurant.

2
00:00:04,248 --> 00:00:09,464
Now I wanna think about what type of profit I've been making

3
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:11,577
at that restaurant. We're gonna think about it in two different ways.

4
00:00:11,592 --> 99:59:59,999
We're gonna think about it in terms of accounting profit

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is really the type of profit most of us associate with a business or a firm.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we also think about it in terms of economic profit.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which we will see it a little bit different. And instead of telling us

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
whether a business is producing income, it tells

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
whether it makes sense to even run the business in the way

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are actually running it.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So first, let's focus on the traditional way of calculating profit.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say my firm, my restaurant, my firm is a restaurant.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In year 1, it brings in a revenue 500 thousand dollars.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So revenue literally is the amount of money customers pay me,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the restaurant. They are paying for their dinner.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is literally the money that is coming in door.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sometimes, people call it Top Line because it is literally the top line of our income statement.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I just wrote it. It's the Top Line.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we have to think about our expenses. Expenses.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, when you are running a restaurant, one of the obvious expenses

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be the cost of food. So food,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So food, we're gonna say, cost us a 100 thousand dollars.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you have the cost of labor.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I have wait stuff, I have the chief, busboy. All those peole
