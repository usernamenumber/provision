99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As a pot of tea cools, the temperature of the tea is modelled by a differentiable function h for 0 is

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
less than equal to t is less than or equal to 10. Where time t is measured in minutes, and temperature h(t)

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is measured in degrees Celsius.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Values of h(t) and selected values of time t are shown in the table above,

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that's right over there.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Use the data in the table to approximate the rate of in which the temperature of the t is changing at

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
time t = 3.5. Show the computations that lead to your answer.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they give us a bunch of points, so let's just graph this just so we can visualize what this data

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is telling us a little bit, and I suspect this might be useful.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this right over here is our temperature axis, this is our temperature

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at any moment in degrees Celcius.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And than this is our time axis and they give us the time 0,2,5,9 and 10

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they give us the temperature at those times.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is 0,2,5 is a little bit further, 9, and than 10.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And than time 0, the temperature is 66 degrees Celsius, so is it right over there.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And time 2 is 60 degrees Celsius.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And time 5 it is 52 degrees Celsius

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So time 5 may be somewhere around here, at 52 degrees Celsius.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
At time 9, or after 9 minutes, it is 44 degrees Celsius.
