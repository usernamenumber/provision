99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're outside of the city wall in Pompei in the Villa of Mysteries. so this is called the villa of mysteries because of this room we're looking at. It's a very mysterious room painted with figures engaged in something that we really can't figure out entirely. The frescos that we're discussing in this room exist in this large villa overlooking the sea, filled with other frescoes from different periods of Roman wall painting. So many of the houses in Pompei are eclectic in their styles. They incorporate styles from one period but then a new room perhaps is constructed or renovated and then a new style is added. So it's a bit of mix. Just like you might have a bathroom in your house left over from the 1960's. This villa had once had large windows that looked out onto the sea, but if we look towards

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the scene now it's actually very distant. The eruption of Mt. Vesuvius added a tremendous amount of shore to the coastline and the Villa of Mysteries is now quite a distance from the beach. It's quite a luxurious villa. Roman wall painting is freso; it's painted directly onto wet plaster. And these are true fresco, or what the Italians call bon fresco, but the ancient Romans also added seco fresco to the top; in other words, the underlayer was a mixture of lime plaster that was basically stained with a kind of watercolor that wouldn't remain on the surface but would actually stain the full depth of that new plaster. But once that had dried sometimes finishing touches would be added with what is called seco fresco or dry fresco. The colors are still very deep; we see reds and greens and purples and blues.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These may not have originally been quite as deep when the excavations were first taking place.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This particular fresco cycle had oil and wax added to it. It'll preserve it but it actually darkened the color.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The room is entered though a very small door, and it has two windows, so that adds to the sense that this was a room that had a special purpose.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's been a lot of debate about what these figures depict.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These are large-scale figures painted on three walls

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we think depicts a Dionysian cult ritual.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
At this time, what we call mystery cults, which were religions that came from the east,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were not entirely ok. The state religion was still the only official religion that was allowed.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right, and so if you were involved in something like a Dionysic cult or another eastern cult you had to keep it somewhat secret.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets start by looking at the figures closest to the doorway, where one would enter.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We see a woman with her hand bend against her hip.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She is fully dressed and has an aristocratic air to her.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And she seems literally to be entering in from the doorway.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She wears a veil and pulls the veil down around her shoulder and chest,

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and because of the veil we think that she is a bride

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact we think that this entire ritual that's being rendered on these walls is about a mystical marriage to the god Dionysus.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He appears on the next wall.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Before we get to him, we see a small child, a boy, who is stark naked and seems to be reading intently from a small scroll

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We think that this is some sore of liturgy, some sort of ritual.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Behind him is a seated female figure,

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then next to her another

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
female figure, who seems to be carrying

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
something, which we really can't identify

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sometimes figures are grouped together,

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but then other times figures are alone,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and seem to be very much in their own world

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There is a sense of continuous space though,

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and continuous time

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They could be going about their own activities

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
independent of each other.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When we look toward the feet of the figures,

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we see a ground that they're standing on.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have a sense of an illusion of space,

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this division of the wall into horizonal bands

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the creation of an illusion of space

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is part of what we consider second style wall painting

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is different than that flatness

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we saw in the first stlye

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Characteristic of second-style wall painting

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it is as if the room itself

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is architecturally extended

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's as if this wall breaks out

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and there's enough room on a platform

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for these figures to stand on.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But this is unusual in that we have

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
such a dense frieze of figures and at this scale.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's right.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the next scene, we see a group of figures

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
around a table, who are involved in some

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
kind of ritual it seems,

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
although it's very difficultto identify

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to identify exactly what

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Some art historians have suggested that this

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is a kind of cleansing ritual.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can see some sort of liquid

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
being poured onto a tabletop.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's a drape that's being lifted up.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The figure who's facing away from us--

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
look at the way that one of her hips

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pushes over the stool that she sits on.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's a purview of illusionism

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's extraordinarily successful

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And even though her back is facing towards us

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are engaged with her.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are looking towards that table

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
almost the way that she is.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have a sense of psychology, of emotion,

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of individuality.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The seated figure seems to be looking toward

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a standing, drunken, figure,

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who we've identified as a Silenus,

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or a drunken older satyr figure.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, satyrs hung around with Dionysus,

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and everybody drank a lot so no surprise there.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yeah, he looks quite tipsy.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Next to him are three figures.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Most people are struck

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by the one figure of the three that is standing.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She seems shocked.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's a kind of recongnition,

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but also a kind of surprise.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And fearfulness...

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And fearfulness, absolutely.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And, of course, that entire upper body

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is framed beautifully by that cloak

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that billows in back of her

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's picked up the wind.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And look at the way it turns in space,

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
light and shadow are used exquisitely

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in order to construct that volume in back of her.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And she moves toward the right but

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
she looks back to her left.

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So there's a sense of reacting and moving away,

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and her left hand, her left forearm is foreshortened.

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Her expression, looking over to the back wall,

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
bridges that gap.

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We seamlessly move over the corner of the room

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
without even realizing it.

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is really thoughtfully conceived.

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
She seems to be reacting to a mask

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
held up by a figure on the next wall.

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a young figure

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
standing above another Silenus.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we're at the back panel where Dionysus sits.

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we can see he is absolutely drunk.

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When we think about Dionysus,

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we think about unbridled pleasure.

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's indicated in his body

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as he lounges across the lap of Ariadne,

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
his mortal lover.

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He's got his own staff draped over him,

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but look at the way that the body's

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
beautifully articulated...

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
almost completely nude,

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
his drape is just falling away,

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but there's a way in which

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
his body's absolutely relaxed.

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is not the way the Greeks or Romans

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
represented their athletes.

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we do see often images of Dionysus in this pose,

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sleeping, dreaming, reclining, drunken, awakening.

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I love the way that Ariadne, a mortal...

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
her hand is over his shoulder,

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and there's a kind of intimacy there.

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He is enjoying himself.

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And as we move toward the right,

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we see a kneeling figure

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who is unveiling something under a purple cloth

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that has just been removed from its case

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's on the ground.

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right. Some have called this a basket of some sort.

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Art historians have spend a lot of time

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
trying to determine what exactly is there.

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Many people think it's a phallus.

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
One art historian has suggested

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it might be a rendering of Mt. Vesuvius,

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is visible from just outside this house.

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Next to that, we have a winged figure,

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who's foreshortened, moving towards us,

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but looking over to her left,

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and she's whipping a figure who's kneeling

144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
across the next corner.

145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The winged figure's body

146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
has this wonderful torsion,

147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as she reaches back

148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in order to really get a good strike

149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with that whip.

150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So just like the back left corner,

151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the artist, whoever it is--

152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we don't have a name--

153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
has been able to bridge that corner seamlessly,

154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we know that the velocity of that whip

155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will move our eye right over to its victim.

156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The woman's back is exposed.

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Her head is down, in the lap of a woman

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that seems to be comforting her.

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And beside them another woman,

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who is nude, who seems to be dancing.

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Look at the elegance of this figure,

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that way the her drape creates a crescent

163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that frames her body just beautifully.

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have figures who are in groups together,

165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
comforting each other,

166
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
enacting something together,

167
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then a figure who is isolated,

168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or seems to be somewhat separated from that group.

169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The scene is then interrupted by a large window,

170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and concludes with three figures on the right.

171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have a small, angelic figure--

172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a kind of putti, that seems to be dancing.

173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then another figure who's seated,

174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who's doing her hair,

175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
being helped by a standing woman.

176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Perhaps she's already gone through the ritual,

177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and is a bride of Dionysus,

178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or perhaps the next initiate--we really don't know.
