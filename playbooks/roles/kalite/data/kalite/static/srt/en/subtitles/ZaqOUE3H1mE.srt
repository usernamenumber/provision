1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,730
I think we're just about ready to learn how to subtract

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,130
pretty much any number from any other number.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,750
So let's just review a little bit of what we know already.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,883
So if I were to ask you what 16 - 4 is,

5
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:15,977
I could draw 16 apples

6
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:17,818
and then take away 4 of the apples.

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:20,005
Or I could actually draw a number line,

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,126
and actually let me do it here

9
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:23,703
just to start off the video to get warmed up.

10
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:26,170
I could draw the number line and maybe that's 16

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,210
maybe that's 17.

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:35,160
It's 15, 14, 13, 12, let me go down all the way to 11.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,590
I could keep going but I've run out of space.

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,720
Now, if I don't know in my head what 16 - 4 is, and

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,960
it's a pretty good one to eventually know in your head,

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,996
you could start in your number line

17
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:48,588
or you could imagine the number line in your brain

18
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:49,730
and you could go down by 4s.

19
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:58,350
16 - 1 is 15, minus 2 is 14, minus 3 is 13, minus 4 is 12.

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,560
And you would have the answer.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,120
16 - 4 is 12.

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,809
Now an even easier way to do this problem is

23
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:10,490
just to focus on the places of the digits.

24
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,820
Now let me be clear what I mean when I say that.

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,410
Let me re-write it. 16 - 4,

26
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,680
and I've gone over this a little bit

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,520
in the addition videos.

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,524
This is the ones place.

29
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:24,870
The 6 is in the ones place.

30
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,900
The 4 is in the ones place.

31
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,550
The 1, right here, this right here,

32
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,023
or there was something down here,

33
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:35,880
this column, that is the tens place.

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,450
Now what do we mean by that?

35
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:44,620
Well 16 is the same thing as 10 + 6.

36
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,100
So when we write it, this 1 literally means one 10.

37
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,170
If you think of it in money it means one $10 bill.

38
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,430
If I had a 2 there, if I had 26, that means two $10 bills.

39
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,040
Two $10 bills would mean $20.

40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,730
So that's two $10 bills and then six $1 bills.

41
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,350
You can view this as a $1 bill place,

42
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,950
that's the $10 bill place.

43
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:14,660
If I had 357, you could view this as three $100 bills,

44
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,345
five $10 bills, and seven $1 bills, and that's why

45
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:24,510
this is called the 100s, that's the 100s place,

46
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,290
this is the tens place, and this is the ones place.

47
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,215
And we'll dig a little bit deeper into this as we explore

48
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:35,070
borrowing and regrouping more in this video and in others.

49
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,600
But I wanted to label these places

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,719
because what I want to show you is

51
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,131
you don't even have to think about 16 - 4.

52
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:43,600
You can actually just look at just the ones place

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,521
and think about 6 - 4, and say 6 - 4

54
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:48,883
well you could draw a number line or

55
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:51,114
you could even use your fingers if you have to,

56
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:52,340
but you probably have that memorized.

57
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,695
You could probably visualize it in your head, 6 - 4 is 2.

58
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:02,783
And then 1, then we go to the tens place, 1 minus nothing --

59
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:03,840
there's nothing over here.

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,790
So 1 minus nothing is 1, and you get 12.

61
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,300
Same answer, we were able to simplify a little bit.

62
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,010
Let's try another problem like that.

63
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:22,720
If I were to ask you what 78 - 37 is.

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,440
So we start off in the ones place and we say 8 - 7

65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,340
that's 8 ones minus 7 ones, or just 8 - 7.

66
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:36,921
8 - 7 is equal to 1.

67
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:39,030
Then we go to the 10s place.

68
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,265
7 - 3 -- now remember, this is seven 10s,

69
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:46,490
or seven $10 bills, minus three $10 bills.

70
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,490
If I had seven $10 bills

71
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,090
and I give away three of those $10 bills,

72
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,108
then I'll have four $10 bills,

73
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,800
or 7 - 3 is equal to 4.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,880
And just like that we were able to figure out that

75
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,490
78 - 37 is 41.

76
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,659
This would have been really hard to do,

77
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,030
it would take me forever to draw 78 apples

78
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,940
and to cross out 37 of them.

79
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,150
Or to draw a number line all the way up to 78

80
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,450
then go back 37 spaces.

81
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,270
That would have given you the answer,

82
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,390
but it would have taken you forever to solve it that way.

83
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,310
Just by focusing on just each column,

84
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,080
you're able to get the right answer.

85
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,590
Well, you might say, hey Sal, but what happens if I can't --

86
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,819
well, let me give you an example

87
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:28,615
where this will start to become difficult doing it this way.

88
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:29,910
I'll do one more example like this.

89
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:37,890
So let's say I had 95 - 31.

90
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,590
Just like that, 5 - 1 is 4.

91
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,270
9 - 3 is 6.

92
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,700
95 - 31 is 64.

93
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,280
You're probably saying, Sal, subtraction is easy.

94
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,580
I can just look at each place, the ones place and subtract,

95
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,240
tens places and subtract.

96
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,808
But I'm about to show you that

97
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:55,560
it's not always at least that easy.

98
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,450
With a little bit of practice hopefully you'll realize

99
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,700
that it's also not too bad.

100
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:08,510
So what if I were to ask you what 22 - 17 is.

101
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:14,379
Now once again, I could draw 22 oranges or apples

102
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,585
and take away 17 of them

103
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:16,770
and you could count what's left and you would get

104
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,730
the right answer, but that would take you forever.

105
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,140
Is there any way I could do that

106
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,890
maybe just on the paper right here?

107
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,360
Now your reaction might say let me just do what

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,780
you just did before.

109
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,323
But if you look here, if I try to subtract 7 from 2,

110
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:32,008
if I have two things,

111
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:34,697
at least for the mathematics that we know right now,

112
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:36,021
I can't give away 7.

113
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,170
I only have 2 to give away.

114
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,900
This would give me something smaller than 0

115
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,960
which we don't know about.

116
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,640
That's a negative number.

117
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,039
As far as we know right now,

118
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,581
we can't subtract 7 from 2.

119
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,540
But we know that 17 is smaller than 22.

120
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,870
So what can we do here to actually do this

121
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,670
subtraction problem?

122
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,980
So what we do here, and you might call it borrowing,

123
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,090
you might call it regrouping.

124
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,250
This 2 right here, this 22 is the same thing as 20 + 2.

125
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,200
That's the 22 right there.

126
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,980
It's 20 + 2.

127
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,740
The 17 is 10 + 7.

128
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,640
That's just another way to write 17.

129
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,760
Now we have a 2 here.

130
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,990
We want something larger than a 7 to subtract from.

131
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,240
So what we can do is we can borrow from this 2

132
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,660
or from this 20, they're the same thing.

133
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,230
Let me do that in another color.

134
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,020
This 2 right here is the same thing as that 20.

135
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,150
A 2 in the tens place means two $10 bills.

136
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,530
Two $10 bills is the same thing as $20.

137
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,280
That's what that 2 represents.

138
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,500
So if I want to make this 2 into something larger,

139
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,130
why don't I take a $10 bill from here.

140
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,710
If I take a $10 bill from here and I turn it into one's

141
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,580
I go to the cashier and say give me a bunch of ones.

142
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,249
So if I take a $10 bill from here,

143
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,500
then this will become $10.

144
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,300
And then I cash into a bunch of ones and put it here.

145
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,020
So then this will become $12.

146
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,486
If we look over here, what it looks like I did is

147
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:09,965
I took a 1 from this 2,

148
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:12,488
so this 2 will now become a 1, right?

149
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:14,809
We went from two $10s to one $10

150
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,886
and it became just one $10 bill.

151
00:07:16,886 --> 00:07:19,760
Then I gave that 1 to this 2.

152
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,260
This 2 then becomes a 12.

153
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,650
And now we can actually subtract.

154
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,770
12 - 7 is 5.

155
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,765
12 - 7 -- I'm just doing the same problem

156
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:34,328
-- just written slightly different on this right hand side --

157
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,107
is also 5.

158
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:39,290
Then we have 1 - 1 is 0.

159
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,876
I could write this as 05,

160
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:42,660
but that's just the same thing as 5.

161
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,310
And here I'd have 10 - 10. Well, 10 -10 is just 0.

162
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,480
So it's just 05.

163
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,140
So 22 - 17 is 5.

164
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,020
Let's try to extend this to an even harder problem.

165
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,610
Hopefully you'll get the hang of how this borrowing or regrouping,

166
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,007
depending on how you want to view it, actually works.

167
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:09,794
So let's say that we have 703 - 67.

168
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:13,075
So if I tried the technique that we learned earlier in this video,

169
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,717
I immediately hit a roadblock.

170
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:18,050
I say 3 - 7 -- well if I have 3 apples,

171
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,390
I can't take away 7 from there.

172
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,470
So I'm at an impasse.

173
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,590
I don't know what to do next.

174
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,430
And you say well, maybe I can borrow.

175
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,070
But I look to the left, well gee, there's a 0 there,

176
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,390
how can I borrow from a 0?

177
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,932
Then well, there's a 7 there,

178
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:33,120
but then how do I borrow from the 7, all of that.

179
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,460
And the best way to think about it

180
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,880
and the more practice you do the better,

181
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,582
remember this 703 is seven $100 bills

182
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:45,390
plus zero $10 bills plus three $1 bills.

183
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,940
And 67 is six $10 bills or $60 plus 7.

184
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,860
So if we can't borrow from here because I have no $10 bills,

185
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,270
what we want to do is break one of the $100 bills.

186
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,520
So what I do is I take $100 bill from here,

187
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,860
so now I'm left with $600.

188
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,280
So this 7 becomes a 6, right?

189
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,248
It's a 6 in 100s place

190
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:12,610
and it represents six 100's, six $100 bills.

191
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,610
So, remember, I took out a $100 bill.

192
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,050
And then what I can do is I can split that $100 bill,

193
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,191
I can give $10 to this guy

194
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:24,871
-- or sorry, I can give $90 to this guy right here,

195
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:27,550
and then I can give $1 to this guy

196
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,963
-- sorry, I could give $99. sorry --

197
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:32,546
I could give $90 to this guy

198
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:35,227
and then I can give $10 to that guy right there.

199
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:37,280
I have $100 to work with, right?

200
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,350
So what happens?

201
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,470
If I do that, if I take that $100 bill that I took out from here,

202
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,612
went to the cash register, I got nine 10s or $90.

203
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,140
So now I have nine 10s here.

204
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,823
And then I have ten 1s here,

205
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:54,048
so I add 10 + 3, it becomes 13.

206
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:56,800
And just like that, all my numbers in each column,

207
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,640
if I were to draw columns like this, divide them up.

208
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,130
Everything on top is bigger than everything on the bottom

209
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,090
so now I can subtract.

210
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,960
So 13 - 7 is 6.

211
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,230
9 - 6 is 3.

212
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,840
6 minus nothing is 6.

213
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,620
So 703 - 67 is 636.

214
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,424
Now you might be saying,

215
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:20,076
OK Sal, I kind of get what you did,

216
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:23,140
you took 100 from here, you put 90 here,

217
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,540
so that became a 9, you gave 10 here.

218
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,338
But how did you know to do that

219
00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:28,480
or what's a more systematic way of doing it.

220
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,660
This kind of is a conceptual way, which is,

221
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,350
in my mind, the most important way to understand it.

222
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,080
But let me show you kind of a mechanical way to do that.

223
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,274
So let's say we have 700

224
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:40,614
-- I'll do the same problem over again

225
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:43,490
703 - 67.

226
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,790
I look at all of the numbers on the top and I say

227
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,150
are they all larger than the numbers on the bottom?

228
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,190
I said well, 3 -- well, 7 is larger than 3, that's not good.

229
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,695
6 is larger than 0, that's not good.

230
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:53,200
So I need to do something.

231
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,170
So what I do is I start with this 3 right here,

232
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,540
and I say well, can I borrow from this number to the left?

233
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,289
And I look to the number to the left

234
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:02,767
and I can not borrow from 0.

235
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,780
So then I look to the two numbers to the left

236
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,740
and say can I borrow from 70?

237
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,500
I say well gee, I can definitely borrow from 70

238
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,330
we know this is actually 700.

239
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,840
So if I borrow from 70 what happens?

240
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:23,200
If I borrow one 10 from 70, 70 becomes 69, right?

241
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,910
If I borrow 1 from 70, it becomes 69.

242
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,970
And I take that 1 and it's essentially a 10, right?

243
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,850
So that 10 + 3 is now 13.

244
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,710
And now these are my columns.

245
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,120
Just just like that.

246
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,950
You have 13 - 7 is 6, 9 - 6 is 3.

247
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,800
And then 6 right down here.

248
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,180
Now, another way you can think about it,

249
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,050
I'll do the exact same problem.

250
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,800
703 - 67.

251
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,210
You could start at the left.

252
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,977
You could say look, 7 is, well,

253
00:11:57,977 --> 00:11:59,152
it's larger than what's below it.

254
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,100
Nothing is below it, so I'm cool there.

255
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,770
And then you go 1 right to the right of it.

256
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,730
And you say well, 0

257
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,714
-- well, 0 is not bigger than what's below it.

258
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:10,800
it's not bigger than the 6 below it.

259
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,830
So I'm going to need to borrow.

260
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,030
So what I can do is I can borrow 1 from the 7

261
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,220
I'm essentially borrowing 100, right?

262
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,260
So if I borrow -- this is 700, let me make it 600.

263
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,725
Now if I take 100 away and I turn it to tens,

264
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,090
that's 10 tens.

265
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,351
It looks like we took a 1 away

266
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:30,163
and we just put the 1 in front of 0,

267
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:32,390
but we essentially added 10 ten's to it.

268
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,360
But if it helps your mind, we took a 1 away from this,

269
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,480
put it right in front of the 0 just like that.

270
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,130
This is the same 0 as that 0 right there.

271
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,220
And this 1 we took from this guy.

272
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,600
He became 6 and we have a 1 there.

273
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,720
And then we say OK, 10 is definitely greater than 6,

274
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,020
we're cool there.

275
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,300
But all of a sudden here on the 3 we're still not good.

276
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,900
3 is smaller than 7.

277
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,030
Still not cool.

278
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,690
I won't be able to subtract, so let me borrow again.

279
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,490
Now I have something to borrow from.

280
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,560
Remember we went from the left to right this time

281
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,660
instead of from the right to left.

282
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,670
All of these are valid ways of doing it.

283
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,860
So we say let me borrow 1 from the 10.

284
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,957
So 10 - 1 is 9,

285
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,754
and let me give that 1 to the 3 to go 13.

286
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:15,050
Remember, it's not a 1.

287
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,170
I added 10 to it.

288
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,479
If I take 1 from the ten's place,

289
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,570
that's like adding 10 to the ones place.

290
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,480
Don't want to confuse you.

291
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,110
Hopefully you see the system here.

292
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,193
I want you to be able to do the problems before you have to

293
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:28,960
get the real deep understanding of what's going on.

294
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,620
So 13 - 7 is 6, 9 - 6 is 3, 6 - 0 is 6.

295
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,620
636.

296
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,558
Let's do a couple more problems,

297
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:41,060
because the subtraction sometimes with the borrowing

298
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,510
can become a little bit confusing on what to do next.

299
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:52,330
Let's say 953 - 754.

300
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,630
Maybe we'll do it in all of the different ways

301
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,190
that you can actually do this type of problem.

302
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,990
First, one of the ways I talked about is to start at the right.

303
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,520
Let's see, is 3 larger than 4?

304
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,230
No, it's not.

305
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,970
So we're going to have to make it larger than 4.

306
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,354
So let's borrow from this 5 over here.

307
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:10,490
-- So you'll say...let me do it right here --

308
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:16,571
So if I borrow from the 5, the 5 will become a 4,

309
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:20,210
and I'd borrowed 1, the 3 becomes a 13.

310
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,130
Remember, if I borrow 1 from the tens place,

311
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,540
that's actually a 10.

312
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,020
This is 5 tens.

313
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,350
I took one of the 10s away, so I'm left with four 10s,

314
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,480
and I added that 10 to the 3, so I have 13.

315
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,300
So this looks good.

316
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,310
13 - 4, I'll be able to subtract there.

317
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,880
But here I have a problem.

318
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,560
4 is less than 5.

319
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,389
It was cool before

320
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:40,969
but now all of a sudden it's messed up.

321
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:42,920
So I'm going to have to borrow again.

322
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,590
I'm going to say well, let me take a 1

323
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,180
from the 100s place, so that will become an 8.

324
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,940
And let me give that 100 to my tens place.

325
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,705
100 is 10 tens.

326
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,209
So I'm going to add a 10 here,

327
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,087
so it's going to become 14.

328
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:59,313
I took the 1 from there and I borrowed it,

329
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:01,760
or I rearranged that 100.

330
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,141
I could re-write that 100 as one 10,

331
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:07,264
and so that's what got us to that from 9 to 8

332
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,644
-- or sorry, 100.

333
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:11,470
I took away 100 from the 900 to get 800.

334
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,981
And when I re-wrote the 100 in the tens place,

335
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,333
it's ten 10s.

336
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,990
So that's why I added a 10 to the 4 that I had before.

337
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,890
I could have just scratched it out and put the 14 like that

338
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,520
to show that I had to re-write the 4.

339
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,820
But now all of a sudden I'm cool.

340
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,930
13 - 4 is 9.

341
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,490
14 - 5 is 9.

342
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,210
8 - 7 is 1.

343
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:40,220
953 - 754 is 199.

344
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,660
Now let's do it the left to right way.

345
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:50,470
953 -- let me use a different color -- minus 754.

346
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,482
Now this is will be a little bit different than I did last time.

347
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:56,510
I say well 9 is definitely larger than 7.

348
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,240
5 is definitely larger -- well, at least it's equal to 5,

349
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,550
so if I subtract maybe I'll get a 0 there.

350
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,980
And 3 is less than 4.

351
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,100
So maybe I'll just have to borrow here.

352
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,795
If I borrow here than this is going to become a 4 and

353
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,630
I'm going to have to borrow from there and give me 14.

354
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,100
It'll essentially boil down to what we did

355
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,720
on this left hand side right here.

356
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,710
Instead, one thing you can do is say OK, 9 is larger than 7.

357
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,590
That's cool.

358
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,390
Or even better you could say 953 is larger than 754.

359
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,030
You know that.

360
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,160
You know that this is going to be a positive number.

361
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,920
That this number is larger than that.

362
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,340
Then you shift over one to the left.

363
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,090
Is 53 larger than 54?

364
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,410
Well no, 53 is not larger than 54.

365
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,207
And because 53 is not larger than 54, let's borrow.

366
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:44,948
Let's borrow from the the 100s place.

367
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:48,118
So this will become an 8.

368
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:50,134
And we have 100 to work with.

369
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,565
So maybe we'll just throw that 100 right here.

370
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,702
So if we throw the 100 into the ten's place,

371
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:59,170
it's ten 10s. So the 5 becomes 15.

372
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,030
We're going from left to right.

373
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,700
So now we say 8 is larger than 7.

374
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,356
Well, 8 is definitely larger than 7,

375
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:08,199
15 is definitely larger than 5.

376
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,810
And then here, once again, we see 3 is less than 4.

377
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,120
But now we can borrow from the 15.

378
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,590
So if we borrow from the 15, the 15 becomes a 14,

379
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,450
and then the 3 becomes a 13.

380
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,541
Because you take 1 away from the tens place,

381
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,210
one $10 bill is equal to 10 ones.

382
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,110
So that's why you added 10 to the 3 and you got 13.

383
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,550
And notice, we ended up really with the same thing

384
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,390
no matter how we did this problem.

385
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,680
So just like that you get 13 - 4 is 9.

386
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,820
14 - 5 is 9.

387
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,060
8 - 7 is 1.

388
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,550
Hopefully you found that pretty straightforward.

389
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,290
These are, frankly, as hard as the borrowing problems get.

390
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,350
The ones where you don't have something to borrow from

391
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,696
or when you do borrow from it,

392
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:50,542
all of a sudden you get a number that

393
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:52,798
-- then you need to borrow from something else.

394
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,460
If you ever get really confused about it,

395
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,760
you should always go back to this.

396
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,620
You should always go back to this notion of regrouping.

397
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,170
This notion of OK, if these things are all too small,

398
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,542
let me take $100 bill over here,

399
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,522
so I have six $100 bills left.

400
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:12,760
And let me regroup that $100 bills into the other spaces.

401
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,510
In this case, we took the $100 bill and we put 90 here

402
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,620
or nine 10s, nine $10 bills, and then $10 of it right there

403
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,229
to make everything in the numerator

404
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:25,525
larger than everything in the denominator.
