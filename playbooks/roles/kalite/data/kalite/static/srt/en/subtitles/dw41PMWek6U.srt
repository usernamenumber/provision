00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,000
Right, what I have right in front of me is the Khan Academy measuring angles,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,067
measuring angles exercise. I have a small part of it in this screen right over here.

3
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:12,934
And it's a pretty cool exercise cause it has this little

4
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:16,138
virtual protracter that we can use to actually measure angles.

5
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:18,400
And I wanna give credit to the, the person who built

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,333
this protracter, cause I think it's pretty neat. Omar Rizwan,

7
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,915
who's actually a high school interim made this, made this

8
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:27,000
pretty neat module. And so in general, when you wanna

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,023
measure an angle, what you wanna do is you wanna put the

10
00:00:30,023 --> 00:00:33,181
center of your protracter at the center of well actually,

11
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:37,268
I said the vertex of the angle at the center of the protracter,

12
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:41,933
and then, what you wanna do is, either rotate the angle or rotate the protractor

13
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:45,800
in this case you are going to rotate the protractor

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,133
you wanna rotate the protracor so that the zero angle

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,268
are look at the zero mark is at one of the sides

16
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:55,240
of the angle and the other side of the angle is within the protractor

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,980
so lets,try to do that so if may be ,if you wanna do that

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,800
this zero side it should be at this side of the angle

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,333
so lets,rotate it

20
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,800
lets rotate it that way,

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,733
its keep rotating it

22
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,867
i can keep it press thats better

23
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:16,333
alright ,thats looks about right so,

24
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,333
one side, is that zero mark and then my angle my other side

25
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:23,200
are if there is a way

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,533
points 2 looks like pretty cause to the 20Ëš mark

27
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:31,067
so i would type the range of the screen you are seeing that

28
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,800
and that is the right answer

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,271
and we can get the other angle

30
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:36,600
so lets,try the measure this one right over here

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,615
so,once again place the center of the protractor

32
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:42,133
at the center at the vertex of an angle

33
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:47,867
we can place the zero degree the base of the protractor at this side of the angle

34
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,667
so we should rotate it a little bit

35
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,600
we want to do one more time that , looks about right

36
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,333
and the angle is now opening up

37
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,667
this is the other side of point to 110 degrees

38
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:02,333
is this larger than 90 degree its also an obtuse angle.

39
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:05,457
the last one is an acute angle,this is obtuse

40
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:08,067
angle 110 degrees more than 90 degrees,we typed in

41
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:10,467
i got the right answer

42
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:12,981
just do couple of more than these

43
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:16,867
so,once again put the center the protractor at the vertex of an angle

44
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:24,312
now i want to rotate it ,there we go, and this looks liking roughly

45
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:29,400
an 80 degree angle but,if i am really precise

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,933
81 or 82 degrees and 80 is my best guess

47
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:39,333
lets do one more of these. Vertex of my angle

48
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:44,533
at the center of my protractor.and I want to put one

49
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:48,333
side of my angle at 0 degrees. here are two ways

50
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,867
to do this, you could do just this, this is not too

51
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:59,067
helpful as the angle is outside the protractor.

52
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:06,867
So lets keep rotating it, so our other side points to

53
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:12,333
70 degrees, so it is an acute angle.

54
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:17,254
I will leave you with that.
