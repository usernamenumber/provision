1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,380
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,160
We are on problem number 13.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,560
It's on page 491.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,070
The price of a telephone was
first increased by 10%, and

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,300
then the new price was
decreased by 25%.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,860
The final price was what price
of the initial price?

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,320
The price final is equal
to the initial

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,540
price-- price initial.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,640
So the price of a telephone,
the initial price, was

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,610
increased by 10%.

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,970
So when you increase something
by 10%, that's like

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,322
multiplying it by 1.1.

14
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:46,040
Or you could say 1 plus 10%.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,080
That's 1.1.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,030
And then it was decreased
by 25%.

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,270
Well, decreasing something by
25% is the same thing as

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,810
multiplying by 0.75.

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,340
Why is that?

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,370
Because that's 1 minus 0.25.

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,250
And so this sets up our
relationship, and so we just

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,800
have to do some math.

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:16,510
What is 0.75 times 1.1?

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,540
That's 75.

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,540
0, 75, 5, 8.

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,930
And how many points do we have
in the decimal point?

27
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,310
One, two, three.

28
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,240
Three points.

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,310
So we have price final
is equal to price

30
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,220
initial times 0.825.

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,420
And what do they say?

32
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,690
The final price was what percent
of the initial price?

33
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,440
So that's it.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,335
The final price is 82.5%
of the initial price.

35
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:51,290
   

36
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,930
And the main thing to just
realize, when you increase

37
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,980
something by 10%, that's
the equivalent of

38
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,960
multiplying it by 1.1.

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,240
And then when you decrease
something by 25%, that's the

40
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,610
same thing as multiplying
it by 0.75.

41
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,020
And why?

42
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,640
Because it's 1 minus 0.25.

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,990
You're decreasing it by 25%.

44
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,690
And that is choice C.

45
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,720
Next problem.

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,425
Number 14.

47
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,130
This is what I do every
day in my job.

48
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,800
I work for a hedge fund.

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,270
I'm always doing percentages.

50
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,530
Image.

51
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,780
Invert colors.

52
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,130
   

53
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,960
I do other things.

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't think my entire livelihood
is based on just

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,520
multiplying percentages, but a
surprising fraction of it is.

56
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,970
Anyway, all right.

57
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,200
Problem number 14.

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,590
When the number w is multiplied
by 4, the result is

59
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,120
the same as 4 is added to w.

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,000
OK, so it's saying when w is
multiplied by 4, so 4w, is the

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,200
same thing as the result as
when 4 is added to w.

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,160
So it's the same thing
as w plus 4.

63
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,850
Fair enough.

64
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,580
What is the value of 3w?

65
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,320
3w is equal to what?

66
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,730
Well, subtract w from both
sides of this equation.

67
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,460
You get 3w equals 4.

68
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,730
That might have been
the fastest problem

69
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,690
we had to do, right?

70
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,420
We just solved it.

71
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,770
3w is equal to 4.

72
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,020
Choice E.

73
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,220
   

74
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,560
Problem 15.

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,330
The lengths of the sides of a
right triangle are consecutive

76
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,530
even integers.

77
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,520
Fascinating.

78
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,120
And the length of the
shortest side is x.

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,010
It looks like I'm going
to have to draw a

80
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,450
triangle, in yellow.

81
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,335
So it's a right triangle.

82
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:41,350
   

83
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,470
That looks like a right
triangle to me.

84
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,350
And they say they're consecutive
even integers, and

85
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,100
the shortest side is x.

86
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,940
So let's say this is x.

87
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,340
Consecutive even integers.

88
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,040
So the next even integer is
going to be x plus 2.

89
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,320
And then the last integer,
it's going to be the

90
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,400
hypotenuse, the next one.

91
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,350
And that's going to have
to be x plus 4.

92
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,770
And they want to
know what is x?

93
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,410
Or what equation can be
used to solve for x?

94
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,860
Well, this is the Pythagorean
theorem.

95
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,650
So we just say this squared plus
this squared is equal to

96
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,170
this squared.

97
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:21,269
So x squared plus x
plus 2 squared is

98
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,480
equal to x plus 4 squared.

99
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,500
Now let me see if this
is already there

100
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,790
in any of the choices.

101
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,940
x squared plus x plus
2 squared is

102
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,100
equal to x plus 4 squared.

103
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,870
Yeah, it's already there.

104
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,820
We didn't do any simplifying.

105
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,500
This is choice C.

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,390
And we are done.

107
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,690
These problems are extremely
fast to do.

108
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,710
And the important realization
is that they're consecutive

109
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,370
even integers.

110
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,800
So you add 2 each time,
and you just use

111
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,770
the Pythagorean theorem.

112
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,260
Next problem.

113
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,670
Problem 16.

114
00:04:52,670 --> 00:05:05,990
If x is an integer greater than
1, and if y is equal to x

115
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,900
plus 1/x, which of the following
must be true?

116
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,450
I like these.

117
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,460
OK, I'll write all
the choices down.

118
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,500
II, and III.

119
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,850
OK, this first one says
y does not equal x.

120
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,870
The second one says
y is an integer.

121
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,110
   

122
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:36,340
The last one says xy is greater
than x squared.

123
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,660
Well, let's think about it.

124
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,240
   

125
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,920
First of all, do we know
that y is an integer?

126
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,530
Well, no, not really.

127
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,710
I could immediately find an x.

128
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,460
If x is equal to 2,
then y is what?

129
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,840
It's 2 plus 1/2.

130
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,450
It's equal to 2 and 1/2.

131
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,050
So we know y isn't an integer.

132
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,960
If x is an integer, y doesn't
have to be one.

133
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,040
So we know this is definitely
not the case.

134
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,880
Now, do we know for a fact
that y does not equal x?

135
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,610
Well, let's play with this
equation to see if we can get

136
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,720
it to a form that makes a little
bit more sense to us.

137
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,990
So we know that x is greater
than 1, or that x

138
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,650
does not equal 0.

139
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,790
And obviously, this would be
undefined if x equals 0.

140
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,200
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation by x.

141
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:27,980
So we get xy is equal
to x squared plus 1.

142
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,680
This, all of a sudden,
looks fascinating.

143
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,850
xy is equal to x
squared plus 1.

144
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:41,850
So do we know immediately that
xy is greater than x squared?

145
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,960
Well, sure.

146
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,970
No matter what x squared is, xy
is going to be that number

147
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,030
plus 1, right?

148
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,940
And this term is always
going to be positive.

149
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,260
This is always going
to be positive.

150
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,910
There's no way you can
get x squared plus 1.

151
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,015
If you're not dealing with
imaginary numbers, it's going

152
00:06:58,015 --> 00:07:00,660
to be negative, so this whole
thing's going to be positive.

153
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,580
x is positive.

154
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,840
So if this is positive, x is
positive, we know also that y

155
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,770
is going to be positive.

156
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,770
I don't know if that
helps, but anyway.

157
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,860
But we know that xy is always
1 more than x squared, so we

158
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,080
do know that xy is
greater than x

159
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,750
squared, so this is true.

160
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,400
Now, let's see if we can show
that y has to not equal x.

161
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,110
Well, let's think about it.

162
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:31,740
No matter what x is, y is going
to be equal to some

163
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,470
fraction larger than x.

164
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,130
And as you get really, really,
really large x's, that

165
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,420
fraction, the difference,
is going to get smaller.

166
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,570
You could try it on
a calculator.

167
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:47,390
If you put in x is 5,
then y is 5 and 1/5.

168
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:55,240
If x is 500, then y
is 500 and 1/500.

169
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,280
But no matter what number you
put in that's a larger number

170
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,460
than 1, you're going to get
a little bit left over.

171
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,080
y is going to be just
that little bit

172
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,240
fraction larger than x.

173
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,010
So we know for a fact that y is
going to be not equal to x.

174
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,680
And so this is also true.

175
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,230
So choices I and III, and
that is choice D.

176
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,430
We are done with this section,
because there's only 16

177
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,850
problems as far as I can tell.

178
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,480
Yep, only 16 problems. Actually,
I think we're done

179
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,890
with all the math sections
in this test

180
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,240
number 2 in the book.

181
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,120
I will see you in the next
test. See you soon.
