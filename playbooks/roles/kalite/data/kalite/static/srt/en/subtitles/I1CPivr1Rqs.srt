1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,500
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,510
So we're on problem number 15.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,210
Boy, this SAT can be tiring.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,790
I know you probably rolled your eyes when I said that

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,060
because you're the one that
has to take it, not me.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,330
Anyway, number 15.

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,730
The graph above shows-- and this is on page 399-- shows

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,280
Alena's height in inches.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,820
So the graph looks like this.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,570
And then I'll draw the
rest. I don't have to

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,580
draw these fancy lines.

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,470
You get the point.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,690
So this is her age.

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:45,490
Let me do it at 6,
8, 10, and 12.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,070
And then when she's 6,
she is 45 inches.

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,150
This is in inches.

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,990
So at 6 she's at 45.

18
00:00:52,990 --> 00:01:00,060
At 8 she's at 50.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,830
At 10 she's at 55-- no, a little
less than-- well, this

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,320
is like-- on the graph
it looks like 55.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,740
And the way they draw it, it's like a little bit lower than

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,840
55, so it's like a little bit lower than 55 on the graph.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:25,800
And then at 12, she's
right at 60.

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,500
And then they draw a line connecting all of them so it

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,650
looks something like this.

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,220
So the line looks like
this, like this.

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,360
It's nothing fancy.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,540
And it says Alena's height at age 12 was what percent

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,390
greater than a height
at age 6?

30
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,030
So when she is 12,
age, height.

31
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,600
So at age 12, she's what?

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,910
At age 12, she's
60 centimeters.

33
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,930
That's this point, right?

34
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,300
60.

35
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,960
And at age 6 she's what?

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,100
45 centimeters, right?

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,669
Age 6, 45.

38
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,750
So this question is really-- so we've got to make sure that

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,400
we're reading right.

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,220
Alena's height at the age of 12 was what percent greater

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,850
than her height at
the age of 6?

42
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:26,610
So they're really saying 60 is what percent greater than 45?

43
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,690
And so I actually do this
all the time in my job.

44
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,060
I work in a hedge fund.

45
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,450
But this is what I
do all the time.

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,220
And a really quick and dirty way of doing this, you would

47
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,660
literally say, well, this is the same thing as 60 divided

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,480
by 45 minus 1 to get you the percentage, because-- well, I

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,930
don't want to confuse
you too much.

50
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,820
But 60 divided by 45
will tell you what

51
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,750
percentage 60 is of 45.

52
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,310
So 60 divided by 45 is what?

53
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,290
It's 1 and 15/45, or
1.333333, right?

54
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,720
I think you can confirm that.

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,200
So that equals 1.333333.

56
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:22,440
Or 60 is 133% of 45.

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,640
We can make all of
these statements.

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,860
60 over 45, that's a percent
that 60 is of 45.

59
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,180
That's 1.333333.

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,760
It keeps repeating, right?

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,340
Repeating.

62
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,070
But they want to know what percent greater than her

63
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,120
height at age 6.

64
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,390
So 60 is 133% of 45.

65
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:47,210
This is the same thing as
saying that 60 is 33%

66
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:53,420
greater than 45.

67
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,380
Hopefully, you understand
what I'm saying.

68
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,930
Saying one thing is 133% of another thing is the same

69
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,650
thing as saying that this
first thing is 33%

70
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,890
greater than 45.

71
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:13,690
Or we could say that saying
something 133% is equal to 33%

72
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,040
more than 100%, right?

73
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,400
More than 100.

74
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,820
I hope I'm not confusing you.

75
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,100
I try to do this in a couple of different ways to help you

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,370
understand what 33%
greater means.

77
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:35,120
If x is 33% greater than y, that means x is 133% of y.

78
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
So they want to know how much greater is 60 than 45?

79
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,750
Well, it's 33% greater.

80
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,983
And so the answer is C,
33 and 1/3, because

81
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,950
it's a repeating 33.

82
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,200
Next problem.

83
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,100
This looks fun.

84
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,486
So we have this cylinder
looking thing.

85
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:02,720
Let's see how well I can
draw a cylinder.

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,490
Well, my cylinder's going to be a little tilted, but you

87
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,630
get the point.

88
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,520
I should have drawn these vertical lines first. This is

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,258
the cylinder.

90
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,030
So that's the cylinder.

91
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,500
And they're saying that on the base of the cylinder, we have

92
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,720
this line x, or this
distance x.

93
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,040
It goes to the center.

94
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,390
It's essentially the center
of the cylinder.

95
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,390
Let me draw it in a more muted color to show that's it's in

96
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,640
the inside, and the height of the cylinder goes to the top.

97
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,680
They're essentially asking which of the following-- and

98
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,020
they give you a bunch of choices-- has the same volume

99
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,340
as the cylinder shown with radius x and height to x?

100
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:58,690
So they're saying this is x,
that's x and this is 2x.

101
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,000
So before figuring out which of these choices has the same

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,110
volume as this thing, let's figure out what the volume of

103
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,680
this thing is.

104
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,050
Well, if you know the area of a circle, you essentially know

105
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,140
the volume of a cylinder, because it's really the area

106
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,510
of one-- you can kind of figure
out the area of this

107
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,450
base and then just multiply it times the height, right?

108
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,000
Multiply it times this third
dimension of the height.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,360
So what's the area
of this base?

110
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,920
So volume is equal to area of the base, which is pi times

111
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,150
the radius squared, so
that's pi x squared.

112
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,460
And then we're going to multiply
that times the

113
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,830
height, times this, times 2x.

114
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,540
So the volume of this is
equal to 2x times this.

115
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,710
You get 2 pi x to the
third, right?

116
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,300
Because this is x to the first.
Add the exponents.

117
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,990
So volume is 2 pi
x to the third.

118
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,840
We know the volume
of our cylinder.

119
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,370
So let's see what these
other choices are.

120
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:06,120
So choice A says a cylinder with radius 2x and height x.

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,580
So radius is equal to 2x and the height is equal to x.

122
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,300
So what would this be?

123
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:21,250
The volume would be this squared times pi times this

124
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,010
because we take the area of the base, so the area of the

125
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,880
base would be what?

126
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,020
It would be pi times 2x squared, and we multiply that

127
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,130
times the height.

128
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,740
And this equals-- I can already
tell you this isn't

129
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,140
going to be right because
we've got a 4 in here.

130
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,120
Oh, this is x, right?

131
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,410
The height is x.

132
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:48,180
So this will get 4 pi x to the third if you multiply it out,

133
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,050
so that's not it, B.

134
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:58,710
A cylinder with radius 2 pi, radius is equal to 2 pi x, and

135
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,650
height is equal to x.

136
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,110
And I can already tell you this is going to be it because

137
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,300
we're going to get something with a pi squared in it

138
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,500
because if you take the area of the base, you get-- the

139
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:18,340
volume will just be pi times
2 pi x squared times x.

140
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,835
And we're going to get 4 pi squared, and then you're going

141
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,410
to have another pi, and
it's 4 pi cubed.

142
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,800
It's not going to be the
same thing as this.

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,080
Choice C.

144
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,280
A cube with edge 2x.

145
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,670
This is easy.

146
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,429
If a cube has side 2x, it's
volume is just that side

147
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,789
cubed, right?

148
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:41,120
So volume would be 2x
to the third, and

149
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,130
that equals 8x cubed.

150
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,350
That's definitely not right.

151
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,600
D.

152
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,730
A cube with edge 2 pi x.

153
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,420
So the same thing.

154
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,220
The volume for this cube would be 2 pi x to the third.

155
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,100
And this is going to be what?

156
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,130
8 pi to the third,
x to the third.

157
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,810
Once again, not right.

158
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,860
So assuming I haven't done anything wrong yet, it's

159
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,830
probably going to be choice
E, but let's confirm.

160
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,460
Choice E.

161
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,710
A rectangular solid with the
dimensions-- ah, see this

162
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,770
looks very suspicious.

163
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,088
So let me draw the rectangular
solid.

164
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:27,210
A rectangular solid with the
dimensions x, 2x and pi x.

165
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,920
So we just multiply width times
height times depth.

166
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,990
So x times 2x times pi x.

167
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,275
You would get 2 pi x cubed.

168
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,230
And the answer is E.

169
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,420
Very good.

170
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,490
And you could have done that faster just kind of inspecting

171
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,880
some of these earlier ones.

172
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,290
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
