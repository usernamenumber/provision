1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,390
Let's apply what we learned in
the last video into a concrete

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,810
example of the work done by a
vector field on something

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,560
going through some type of
path through the field.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,400
So let's say that I
have a vector field.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,800
It's defined over r2
for the x-y plane.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,160
So it's a function of x and y.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,330
It associates a vector with
every point on the plane.

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:31,070
And let's say my vector field
is y times the unit vector i

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:37,240
minus x times the
unit vector j.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,980
And so you can imagine if
we were to draw-- let's

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,630
draw our x- and y-axes.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,240
I'll do it over here.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,840
If we were to draw our x- and
y-axes, this associates a

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,530
vector, a force vector--
let's say this is actually a

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,340
force vector-- with every
point in our x-y plane.

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,160
So this is x and this is y.

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,805
So if we're at the point, for
example, 1, 0, what will the

19
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:05,480
vector look like that's
associated with that point?

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:12,360
Well, at 1, 0, y is 0, so this
will be 0, i minus 1, j.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,690
Minus 1, j looks like this.

22
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,446
So minus 1, j will
look like that.

23
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,630
At x is equal to 2-- I'm just
picking points at random, ones

24
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,665
that'll be -- y is still 0, and
now the force vector here

25
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:29,200
would be minus 2, j.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,330
So it would look
something like this.

27
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,500
Minus 2, j.

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,700
Something like that.

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,110
Likewise, if we were to go
here, where y is equal to 1 and

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:47,310
x is equal to is 0, when y is
equal to 1, we have 1, i minus

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,530
0, j, so then our vector
is going to look like

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,610
that at this point.

33
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,690
If we're to go to 2-- you
could get the picture.

34
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,940
You can keep plotting
these points.

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,400
You just want to get a sense
of what it looks like.

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,690
If you go here, the vector's
going to look like that.

37
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,910
If you go maybe at this point
right here, the vector's

38
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,733
going to look like that.

39
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,850
I think you get
the general idea.

40
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,530
I could keep filling
in the space for this

41
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,460
entire field all over.

42
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,140
You know, just to make it
symmetric, if I was here,

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,690
the vector is going
to look like that.

44
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,510
You get the idea.

45
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,500
I could just fill in all of
the points if I had to.

46
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,890
Now, in that field, I have some
particle moving, and let's say

47
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,080
its path is described by
the curve c, and the

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,120
parameterization of it is x of
t is equal to cosine of t, and

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,270
y of t is equal to sine of t.

50
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,070
And the path will occur from
t-- let's say, 0 is less than

51
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,480
or equal to t is less
than or equal to 2pi.

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,400
You might already recognize
what this would be.

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
This parameterization
is essentially a

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,420
counterclockwise circle.

55
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,680
So the path that this
guy is going to go is

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,730
going to start here.

57
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,120
Well, you can imagine, t in
this case, you could almost

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,980
imagine is just the angle of
the circle, but you can

59
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,130
also imagine t is time.

60
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,550
So at time equals 0, we're
going to be over here.

61
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,260
Then at time of pi over 2,
we're going to have traveled a

62
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,820
quarter of the circle to there,
so we're moving in

63
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,020
that direction.

64
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,690
And then at time after pi
seconds, we would have

65
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,150
gotten right there.

66
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,730
And then all the way after 2pi
seconds, we would have gotten

67
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,180
all the way around the circle.

68
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:39,440
So our path, our curve, is one
counterclockwise rotation

69
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,150
around the circle, so to speak.

70
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,620
So what is the work done by
this field on this curve?

71
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,670
So the work done.

72
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,920
So the work, we learned in the
previous video, is equal to the

73
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,510
line integral over this contour
of our field, of our vector

74
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:06,720
field, dotted with the
differential of our movement,

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,950
so dotted with the differential
of our movement dr.

76
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,790
Well, I haven't even
defined r yet.

77
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,080
I mean, I kind of have just the
parameterization here, so we

78
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,020
need to have a vector function.

79
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,230
We need to have some r
that defines this path.

80
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,360
This is just a standard
parameterization, but if I

81
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,590
wanted to write it as a vector
function of t, we would write

82
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:33,760
that r of t is equal to x of t,
which is cosine of t times i

83
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:40,020
plus y of t times j, which is
just sine of t times j.

84
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,170
And likewise, this is for 0 is
less than or equal to t, which

85
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,740
is less than or equal to 2pi.

86
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,230
And this are equivalent.

87
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,210
The reason why I took the pain
of doing this is so now I can

88
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,460
take its vector function
derivative, and can figure out

89
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,210
its differential, and then I
can actually take the dot

90
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,160
product with this
thing over here.

91
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,120
So let's do all of that and
actually calculate this line

92
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,870
integral and figure out the
work done by this field.

93
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,420
One thing might already
pop in your mind.

94
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,900
We're going in a
counterclockwise direction, but

95
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,730
at every point where we're
passing through, it looks like

96
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,540
the field is going exactly
opposite the direction

97
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:13,950
of our motion.

98
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,480
For example, here
we're moving upwards.

99
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,350
The field is pulling
us backwards.

100
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,970
Here we're moving
to the top left.

101
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,550
The field is moving us
to the bottom right.

102
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,010
Here we're moving
exactly to the left.

103
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,590
The field is pulling
us to the right.

104
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,900
So it looks like the field is
always doing the exact opposite

105
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,840
of what we're trying to do.

106
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,300
It's hindering our
ability to move.

107
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,670
So I'll give you a
little intuition.

108
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,600
This'll probably deal
with negative work.

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,080
For example, if I lift
something off the ground,

110
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,290
I have to apply force
to fight gravity.

111
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,820
I'm doing positive work,
but gravity's doing

112
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,940
negative work on that.

113
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,930
We're just going to do the math
here just to make you

114
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,990
comfortable with this idea, but
it's interesting to think about

115
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,000
what's exactly going
on even here.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,490
The field is-- the field I'm
doing in that pink color,

117
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,770
so let me stick to that.

118
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,100
The field is pushing in that
direction, so it's always

119
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,170
going opposite the motion.

120
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,270
But let's just do the math to
make everything in the last

121
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,800
video a little bit
more concrete.

122
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,950
So a good place to start
is the derivative of our

123
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,650
position vector function
with respect to t.

124
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:11,670
So we have a dr/dt, which
we could also write

125
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,450
as r prime of t.

126
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,100
This is equal to the derivative
of x of t with respect to t,

127
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:24,490
which is minus sine of t times
i plus the derivative of y

128
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,070
of t with respect to t.

129
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,720
Derivative of sine of t
is just cosine of t.

130
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,820
Cosine of t times j.

131
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,840
And if we want the
differential, we just multiply

132
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,610
everything times dt, so we get
to dr is equal to-- we could

133
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,280
write it this way.

134
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,700
We could actually even
just put the d-- well,

135
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,300
let me just do it.

136
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,860
So it's minus sine of t dt--
I'm just multiplying each of

137
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,290
these terms by dt, distributive
property-- times the unit

138
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:59,420
vector i plus cosine of t dt
times the unit vector j.

139
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,270
So we have this piece now.

140
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,880
And now we want to take the dot
product with this over here,

141
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,150
but let me rewrite our
vector field in terms of in

142
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,570
terms of t, so to speak.

143
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,030
So what's our field going to
be doing at any point t?

144
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,810
We don't have to worry
about every point.

145
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,760
We don't have to worry, for
example, that over here the

146
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,900
vector field is going to be
doing something like that

147
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,960
because that's not on our path.

148
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,850
That force never had an
impact on the particle.

149
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,700
We only care about what
happens along our path.

150
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,780
So we can find a function that
we can essentially substitute y

151
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,260
and x for, their relative
functions with respect to t,

152
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,180
and then we'll have the force
from the field at any

153
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,500
point or any time t.

154
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,780
So let's do that.

155
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,410
So this guy right here, if I
were to write it as a function

156
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,420
of t, this is going to be equal
to y of t, right? y is a

157
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,630
function of t, so it's sine
of t, right? that's that.

158
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:05,210
Sine of t times i plus-- or
actually minus x, or x of

159
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,310
t. x is a function of t.

160
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:13,070
So minus cosine of t times j.

161
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,080
And now all of it seems
a little bit more

162
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,570
straightforward.

163
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,170
If we want to find this line
integral, this line integral is

164
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,780
going to be the same thing as
the integral-- let me pick

165
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,050
a nice, soothing color.

166
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,850
Maybe this is a nice one.

167
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,010
The integral from t is
equal to 0 to t is equal

168
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,620
to 2pi of f dot dr.

169
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,130
Now, when you take the dot
product, you just multiply the

170
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,830
corresponding components,
and add it up.

171
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,150
So we take the product of the
minus sign and the sine of t--

172
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,940
or the sine of t with the minus
sine of t dt, I get-- you're

173
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:56,845
going to get minus sine squared
t dt, and then you're going

174
00:08:56,845 --> 00:08:59,780
to add that to-- so you're
going to have that plus.

175
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,250
Let me write that
dt a little bit.

176
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,310
That was a wacky-looking dt.

177
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,270
dt, and then you're going to
have that plus these two guys

178
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,500
multiplied by each other.

179
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,260
So that's-- well, there's a
minus to sign here so plus.

180
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,980
Let me just change
this to a minus.

181
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,230
Minus cosine squared dt.

182
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,830
And if we factor out a minus
sign and a dt, what is

183
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,730
this going to be equal to?

184
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,330
This is going to be equal to
the integral from 0 to 2pi of,

185
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:36,010
we could say, sine squared
plus-- I want to put the t --

186
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,130
sine squared of t plus
cosine squared of t.

187
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,840
And actually, let me take the
minus sign out to the front.

188
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
So if we just factor the
minus sign, and put a minus

189
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,140
there, make this a plus.

190
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,370
So the minus sign out there,
and then we factor dt out.

191
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,880
I did a couple of steps in
there, but I think you got it.

192
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,390
Now this is just
algebra at this point.

193
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,140
Factoring out a minus sign,
so this becomes positive.

194
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,800
And then you have
a dt and a dt.

195
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,510
Factor that out,
and you get this.

196
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,070
You could multiply this
out and you'd get what we

197
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,830
originally have, if that
confuses you at all.

198
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,110
And the reason why I did that:
we know what sine squared of

199
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,190
anything plus cosine squared
of that same anything is.

200
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,400
That falls right out of the
unit circle definition of

201
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,850
our trig function,
so this is just 1.

202
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,050
So our whole integral has been
reduced to the minus integral

203
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,090
from 0 to 2pi of dt.

204
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,910
And this is-- we have
seen this before.

205
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,970
We can probably say that this
is of 1, if you want to

206
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,670
put something there.

207
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,160
Then the antiderivative of 1 is
just-- so this is just going to

208
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,380
be equal to minus-- and that
minus sign is just the same

209
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,510
minus sign that we're
carrying forward.

210
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,520
The antiderivative of 1 is just
t, and we're going to evaluate

211
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,730
it from 2pi to 0, or from 0 to
2pi, so this is equal to

212
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:54,720
minus-- that minus sign right
there-- 2pi minus t

213
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,460
at 0, so minus 0.

214
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,180
So this is just
equal to minus 2pi.

215
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,130
And there you have it.

216
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:06,960
We figured out the work that
this field did on the particle,

217
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,150
or whatever, whatever thing
was moving around in this

218
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,370
counterclockwise fashion.

219
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,620
And our intuition held up.

220
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,820
We actually got a negative
number for the work done.

221
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,430
And that's because, at all
times, the field was actually

222
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,210
going exactly opposite, or was
actually opposing, the movement

223
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,570
of, if we think of it
as a particle in its

224
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,160
counterclockwise direction.

225
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,910
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that helpful.
