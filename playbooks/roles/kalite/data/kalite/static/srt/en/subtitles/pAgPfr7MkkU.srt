1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,590
Let's say we have a magnetic
field that's coming out of the

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,920
right side of the screen.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,340
And it's not just along the
screen, it's actually three

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,110
dimensional.

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,470
So it's going above the
screen, below, but the

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,550
direction of the magnetic
field is from the

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,410
right to the left.

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,760
Let me just draw that.

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,790
And I'm not going to draw a
bunch of the field vector

11
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,060
arrows because that'll just
take up a lot of valuable

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,160
space on our-- so that's the
vector magnetic field.

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,430
It's down here, too.

14
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,390
If I could, I would draw it
above your screen and below

15
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:34,780
your screen.

16
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,630
But it's coming from the
right to the left.

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,380
And then in that magnetic
field I

18
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,390
have an electric circuit.

19
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,750
I won't draw the whole
circuit right now.

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,525
I'll do that in a second.

21
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,410
But let's say I have--
part of the electric

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,640
circuit is a loop.

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,760
And the loop looks like this.

24
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,990
I'm trying to draw
it carefully.

25
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,820
So that we can-- because I think
a careful drawing will

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,210
be more useful in
a second than an

27
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,540
uncarefully drawn drawing.

28
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,050
So let's see.

29
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,540
So it's a loop.

30
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,700
You can almost-- you could
imagine taking a paper clip

31
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,670
and putting it into
this shape.

32
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,660
   

33
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,700
Oh, that's good enough,
I think.

34
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,250
And I have a current going
in this direction

35
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,190
in this paper clip.

36
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,630
So this is the positive,
that's the negative.

37
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,210
So the current is
going like that.

38
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,130
   

39
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,640
Current is going in
a loop like that.

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,930
The current's coming out
of this end, it's

41
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,260
coming into this end.

42
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,420
And let's say that loop of--
it could be a paper clip or

43
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,300
anything-- let's say
that it can rotate.

44
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,980
And that's important.

45
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,300
What's going to happen?

46
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,590
Well, my magnetic field is
coming in this direction.

47
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,600
The current is going
down here, up here.

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,610
What's going to be the net
force of the magnetic

49
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,600
field on this loop?

50
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,980
Well, let's try it out.

51
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,220
And it turns out it's going to
be a different magnitude at

52
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,950
different points
of the current.

53
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,140
So here.

54
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,580
And we don't worry about-- all
we're worried about right now

55
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,620
is direction.

56
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,190
And then maybe a little
intuition of the magnitude.

57
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,550
So we know that the force of the
magnetic field is equal to

58
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,830
the current times the
length vector cross

59
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,670
the magnetic field.

60
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,390
Well, what would be the force of
the magnetic field on this

61
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,480
segment of wire?

62
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,110
We could call this L.

63
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,766
And that L goes in the same
direction as the current.

64
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:28,900
Well, let's see.

65
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,390
Current is just a scalar,
but L is going down.

66
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,720
Magnetic field going
to the left.

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
Cross product.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,850
Cross product, I take my right
hand, put my index finger in

69
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:45,390
the direction of the current,
or in the direction of L,

70
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,980
because that's the first term
of the cross product.

71
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,760
So that's the index finger.

72
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,000
So my index finger goes down,
because that's the direction

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,550
of the current.

74
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,460
And then my middle finger-- and
remember, you have to do

75
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,020
this with the right hand.

76
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,120
If you do it with the left hand,
you're going to get the

77
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,310
opposite result.

78
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,400
And now my middle finger is
going to go in the direction

79
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,940
of the field.

80
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,250
So let me point my
middle finger.

81
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,930
My middle finger is
going to go in the

82
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,870
direction of the field.

83
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,800
I keep having to look
at my own hand.

84
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,900
And then my other two fingers
are just going to do what they

85
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,400
need to do.

86
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,780
So that's my third finger.

87
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,740
That's my pinky.

88
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,810
And then what is my
thumb going to do?

89
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,240
What is my thumb going to do?

90
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,020
Well, my hand-- that's
my hand.

91
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,240
This is what my hand is doing.

92
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,350
I'm pointing downward.

93
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,710
And my palm is kind of
pointing at my body.

94
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,360
So what is my thumb doing?

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,320
I know it's hard to see.

96
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,220
This is my middle finger
right here.

97
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,290
So my thumb is on the other
side of this drawing.

98
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,070
And my thumb is pointing
downwards.

99
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,350
I hope you see that.

100
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,120
And you try it with
your own hand.

101
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,490
So my thumb is pointing
downwards.

102
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,900
So the direction of the force
created by the magnetic field

103
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,860
on this current is going
to go downward.

104
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,380
So let me draw that.

105
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,740
So the force vector--
I'll do it in this

106
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,350
orangey brown color.

107
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,650
The force vector on this segment
of the wire is going

108
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,360
to be going down.

109
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,660
Now what about this segment
of the wire?

110
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,440
Well, think about it.

111
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:23,040
This segment of the wire, the
L vector-- this L vector--

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,920
It's parallel to the magnetic
field just in

113
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,170
the opposite direction.

114
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,040
And so when you take the cross
product-- remember, the cross

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,590
product is you're multiplying
the magnitude of the vectors

116
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,390
that are perpendicular
to each other.

117
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,480
But if this is the L vector
right here, there's no

118
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,260
component of it that it's
perpendicular to

119
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,510
the magnetic field.

120
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,050
So the magnetic field and the
current are in the same plane.

121
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,250
They're parallel.

122
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,450
They're not orthogonal at all.

123
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,140
There's no components of them
that are at 90 degrees.

124
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,130
So when you take the cross
product, you're going to see

125
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,790
that the net force on this
segment of the wire is 0.

126
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,840
And likewise on this segment of
the wire and this segment

127
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,640
of the wire.

128
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,080
Because they aren't in any
way perpendicular.

129
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,800
No components of them are
even perpendicular.

130
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,530
So fair enough.

131
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,250
So all we know right now is the
magnetic field is exerting

132
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,860
a downward force on this
side of our paper

133
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,310
clip or of our circuit.

134
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,620
Now what about this side?

135
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,230
Well, same thing.

136
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,940
Take the cross product.

137
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,300
If this is our L, L cross B.

138
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,380
So take your index finger
in the direction--.

139
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,760
So index finger goes
like that.

140
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,040
Your middle finger will go in
the direction of the field.

141
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,190
So your middle finger is going
to look something like that.

142
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,330
And then your other
two fingers are

143
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,490
going to be like that.

144
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,770
And what is your thumb
going to do?

145
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,720
And this has to be your
right hand to work.

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,320
Your thumb is going to
point straight up.

147
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,000
This is like the heel
of your thumb.

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,500
Your thumb is going to--.

149
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,530
I don't know if that's a good
drawing of a thumb.

150
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,290
But your thumb is essentially
pointing out of the page.

151
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,710
Middle finger in the direction
of the current, or in the

152
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,960
direction of our length.

153
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,690
Sorry, index finger in the
direction of the current.

154
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,460
Middle finger in the direction
of the field.

155
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,170
Thumb points out of the page.

156
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,270
Do that with your own right hand
and you'll see that the

157
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,360
net force of the magnetic field
on this segment of the

158
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,490
wire is going to be upwards.

159
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,720
Let me do it in a different
color just to get some

160
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,910
contrast.

161
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,800
So what's going to happen?

162
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,770
Assuming that this circuit
can rotate,

163
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,880
what's going to happen?

164
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,150
On this side there's
a downward force.

165
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,260
On this side there's
an upward force.

166
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,520
So the magnetic field is
actually exerting a

167
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,380
torque on this wire.

168
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,100
   

169
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,940
If you viewed this little dotted
line as our axis of

170
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,190
rotation, the whole coil is
actually going to rotate

171
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,400
around that line.

172
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,890
And so there's some force over
here, along this whole line

173
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,610
being applied downwards.

174
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,230
And it's actually perpendicular

175
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,250
to our moment arm.

176
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,980
If you remember what we had
learned about torque.

177
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,930
So it will actually exert all
of that force-- that force

178
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,890
times this distance
will be the torque

179
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,480
applied on this side.

180
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,740
And then likewise there's a
torque-- it's really the same

181
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,650
sign, in the same direction,
because here on the other side

182
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,760
of the arm it's pushing
upwards.

183
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,770
So they're not going
to cancel out.

184
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,330
They're both going
to reinforce.

185
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,820
And this whole coil
is going to be

186
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,030
turning in this direction.

187
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,690
Here it's going to be moving up
out of your video screen.

188
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,950
Here it's going to be moving
down into your video screen.

189
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,440
Now what happens?

190
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,190
I'm going to try to not run
out of time either.

191
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,100
So it's going to
start rotating.

192
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,930
So the left hand side's going
to go below the page.

193
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,630
The right hand side's going
to be above the page.

194
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,015
I want to draw some perspective,
that's why I'm

195
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:32,610
just drawing it bigger.

196
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,150
Maybe it looks like that.

197
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,150
   

198
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,950
Maybe my circuit starts
to look like that.

199
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,170
   

200
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,926
And I'll redraw my
axis of rotation.

201
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,250
So this is my axis
of rotation.

202
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,220
And on the way I drew it--
this part, the axis of

203
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,280
rotation is still in the
plane of our video.

204
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,190
But this part of the
coil is, you could

205
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,250
imagine it popping out.

206
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,950
I wish you had 3D glasses on.

207
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,630
It's popping out
of your screen.

208
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,720
This part is going
into your screen.

209
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,450
And the current is still going
in the same direction.

210
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,940
Current is going in that
direction there.

211
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,810
So using the same right hand
rule, on this side of the wire

212
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,130
the magnetic field is going
to be exerting a

213
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,420
net downward force.

214
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,370
But the torque is actually going
to be less because our

215
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,320
moment arm distance is going to
be like-- I want to draw it

216
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,890
with some perspective.

217
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,600
It's going to look something
like that.

218
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,780
So it's going to be going to the
left and behind the page

219
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,929
while the torque is still
just into the page.

220
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,630
So you would actually take the
component of the torque that's

221
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,809
perpendicular.

222
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,720
So there's some component of
the torque that's actually

223
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,169
perpendicular.

224
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,460
I don't want to confuse
you too much.

225
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,000
But you could imagine
the torque lessens.

226
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,630
Even though the net magnetic
force is the same, the

227
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,900
component of that force that's
perpendicular to your moment

228
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,150
arm, that lessens.

229
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,500
So there's still going to be
some torque that's going to be

230
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,680
causing it to rotate downwards
in that direction.

231
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,000
Sorry.

232
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,700
You know what?

233
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,520
I drew this wrong here.

234
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,740
We're pushing up on the right
hand side, we're pushing down

235
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,410
on the left hand side.

236
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:14,030
So the direction is going
to be like that.

237
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,510
Pushing up on the right hand,
down on the left hand.

238
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,670
So you're still going to be
doing the same thing here.

239
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,215
You are going to be
pushing up here.

240
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:24,880
But you're going to be pushing
up directly out of the page.

241
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,610
But that's not completely
perpendicular

242
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,050
to the moment arm.

243
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,100
So the component that is
perpendicular, that's actually

244
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,215
creating rotational torque,
that's going

245
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:36,090
to be a little less.

246
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,370
And then you could imagine that
all the way to the point,

247
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,470
the coil's going to keep
rotating with smaller torque.

248
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,260
At some point you'll be
looking at it head on.

249
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,220
So I can just draw it like
a straight line, right?

250
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,000
You can imagine.

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,710
This arm is on top and this
arm is behind it.

252
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,260
And at this point, what's
going to happen?

253
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,360
All the magnetic force on
this top arm is going

254
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,740
to be popping up.

255
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,860
It's going to be popping up out
of your page but it's not

256
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,400
going to be providing
any torque.

257
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,270
Because it's not perpendicular
anymore to your moment arm.

258
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,610
And likewise, on the bottom
behind this, if you could

259
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,760
visualize this, it would be
exerting a net downward force.

260
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,260
And that's also not going
to be helpful.

261
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,510
But maybe they have some angular
momentum so the wire

262
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,130
will still rotate.

263
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,220
But then when it still rotates,

264
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,390
what's going to happen?

265
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,610
And this is where I'll
leave you with a

266
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,370
little bit of a conundrum.

267
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,490
Actually, I don't want to go
over the Youtube limit, so I'm

268
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,730
going to continue this in the
next video and I'll show you

269
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,110
the conundrum.

270
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,670
See you soon.
