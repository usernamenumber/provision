1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:02,995
What I've done here is that I've copied and pasted a bunch of

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:08,011
pictures that, uh, uh, signify events in our history, when you think about history

3
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:12,330
on a grander scale that most of us have some, uh, relation to

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,977
or we have kind of have heard it,uh,uh, talked about it, a little bit,

5
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:22,933
and the whole point of this is to try to understand, or try to begin to understand how long 13.7 billion years is.

6
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:27,333
So just to start off, I have here, this is the best depiction

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,000
I could find where I, it didn't have copyrights, this is from NASA,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,646
of the Big Bang, and I've talked about it several times,

9
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:38,661
the Big Bang occured 13.7 billion years ago.

10
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:41,912
And then if we go a little bit forward, actually a lot forward,

11
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:45,906
we get to the formation of our actual Solar System and the Earth.

12
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:48,646
This is kind of the proto-planetary disc, or a depiction

13
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:51,664
of the proto-planetary disc forming around our young sun,

14
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:59,002
and so this right here is 4.5 bilion years ago. Now this over here,

15
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:00,674
once again, these aren't pictures of them,

16
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:02,671
these are just depictions, cause no one was there

17
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:05,318
with a camera. This is what we think the asteroid

18
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:08,000
that killed the dinosaurs looked like when it was impacting

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,005
the Earth. And it killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

20
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:19,853
65 million. 65 million year ago. Years ago. so until then,

21
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:23,011
we had land dinosaurs, and then this, as far as the current

22
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:26,309
theories go, got rid of them. Now we'll fast forward

23
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:29,188
a little bit more, at about 3 million years ago.

24
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:33,321
3 million. Let me do this in a color that you can see.

25
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:39,933
About 3 million. So 3 million years ago. Years ago.

26
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:45,349
Our ancestors looked like this. This is Australopithecus afarensis.

27
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:47,903
This, she's, uh, this is, I think is a depiction, uh

28
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:50,968
This is Lucy. uh, this is one of our, uh, probably

29
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:54,667
many of us share, uh, I, i believe the theory is that all of us

30
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:59,513
have some of, some DNA from her. But this was 3 million years ago.

31
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:01,974
And you fast forward some more and you actually have the

32
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:04,993
first modern humans appearing on the planet. People

33
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:08,662
that looked and thought like you and me. This is 200,

34
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:14,327
200,000 years ago. That's right over here. Obviously

35
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:17,346
this drawing was done much later, but this is a depiction

36
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:21,340
of a modern human, so 200,000 years ago. And then

37
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,662
you fast forward even more , and I don't want to keep

38
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:26,309
picking on Jesus. I, I did that when him getting on the jetliner,

39
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:29,328
and I, I genuinely don't mean any offense to anyone,

40
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:31,928
I just keep picking Jesus because frankly our calendar

41
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:36,665
is, uh, is, is, uh, kind of, he, he was a good person that

42
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:40,667
most people, most people know about 2000 years ago,

43
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:44,838
It's when we associate, you know, kind of a lot of modern history occuring

44
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:49,575
after his birth, so i'll put this right here as, obviously

45
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:52,315
a painting of the birth of Jesus, and this is 2000

46
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:57,333
years ago. 2000 years. And then this might be a little

47
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,325
bit, uh, a little bit, uh, uh, american centric, but

48
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:03,600
you know, the Declaration of Independence, it was a

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,993
major event, actually, even on a world-wide basis

50
00:03:04,993 --> 00:03:10,113
it was the first, uh, secular democracy, that, based on kind of a

51
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:12,656
constitutional democracy that, that, showed up on the

52
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:15,071
planet, they had gotten rid of, uh, they said we don't

53
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,068
want the King of England anymore, and, uh, this was

54
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:22,315
about 234 years ago. 234, and I always remembered cause

55
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:25,380
I was born almost on the 200th anniversary, so you just

56
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,830
have to add my age to 200. So this is 234 years ago.

57
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:33,067
So these are all, these are all events or periods of time

58
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:36,247
that, that we've heard about and we've talked about and

59
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:38,709
people throw around these types of years, but what I want to do

60
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,052
in this video is relate it to time scales that we can

61
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:47,474
comprehend, so instead of the Big Bang occuring 13.7 billion

62
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:51,062
years ago, let's pretend like it occured 10 years ago,

63
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:53,570
cause we can, most of us, especially if you are over the

64
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,267
age of 10, can kind of understand what 10 years is. It's

65
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:58,910
a very, very long period of time, but something that's well

66
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,975
within our lifetimes, well within our experience. So let's say,

67
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,412
let's say that 13.7 billion, instead of saying the Big Bang

68
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,570
occured 13.7 billion years ago, let's pretend like it occured

69
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,074
10 years ago. 10 years ago. And if we pretend that it occured

70
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:17,254
10 years ago, let's think about how many years or minutes or hours

71
00:04:17,254 --> 00:04:21,573
ago each of these events would've occured. So the Big

72
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:25,752
Bang, which is really 13.7 billion years ago, if it really had

73
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:29,375
occured 10 years ago, and we scaled everything down,

74
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,579
if we had scaled everything down, then the Earth, the

75
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:37,037
Earth, would have been created about 3.3 years ago. So

76
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:42,867
this would have been 3.3 years ago. So still, nothing, you know nothing

77
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:46,650
kind of amazing about this. This is a significant fraction of the

78
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,251
age of the universe, so not that, not that

79
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:53,059
mind-blowing just yet. But if we go all the way to

80
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,800
when the dinosaurs were extinct, the last land dinosaurs.

81
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,722
Now the 65 million years, this will give you an appreciation

82
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:03,740
of the difference between million and billion, if the universe

83
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,037
was only ten years old, then the dinosaurs would have been

84
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:11,592
extinct 17 DAYS ago! Not even a month ago, the dinosaurs would

85
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:14,143
have been extinct! So, if the universe was created when I was,

86
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:16,976
you know,uh, you know, just graduated, well, i'm in my thirties

87
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:20,459
now, so when I was 24, Just last month, the dinosaurs

88
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:23,802
would have gone extinct! And it gets even crazier!

89
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:27,471
17 days ago, the dinosaurs would have been extinct.

90
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:30,397
Australopithecus afarensis would have walked on Earth

91
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:37,641
19 hours ago! Yesterday! 19 hours ago. 19 hours ago,

92
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,381
she would have been walking around on the planet. And

93
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:44,200
modern humans, modern humans, wouldn't have showed

94
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,809
up until eighty minutes ago. Eighty, eighty minutes.

95
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:52,641
A little over an hour, there wasn't even a modern human.

96
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:55,867
Then, you know, the universe was ten years, It didn't take until just very

97
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:59,700
recently, last hour, for we, us to see someone that looks something

98
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,369
like us. Looks and thinks something like us. Fast forward

99
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:06,481
even more, the birth of Jesus, if the Universe

100
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:10,474
was 10 years old instead of 13.7 and, billion, and if we scaled

101
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:13,400
everything down, then the birth of Jesus would have been

102
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:20,645
46 seconds ago. 46 seconds ago. And then if we fast forward

103
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:24,639
all the way to the Declaration of Independence, this would

104
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,747
have occured, this would have occured 5 seconds ago. 5 seconds

105
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:34,995
ago. So this isn't quite, quite as mind,as mind-blowing as the scale

106
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,735
of the universe, but in my mind, this is pretty, still pretty amazing,

107
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:43,133
I mean all that has happened since 1776, on a global basis,

108
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:46,744
could have been encapsulated in 5 seconds if the Universe was,

109
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:50,067
if the age of the universe was 10 years. So hopefully,

110
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:52,920
that gives you a, a little bit of perspective. In the next video,

111
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,660
i'm going to compare, instead of, instead of condensing things

112
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,725
in time, i'm going to compare this scale to kind of a distance scale,

113
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:01,976
so we can kind of say "Hey, if the age, if the universe was the,

114
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:05,941
the number of pixels on my screen,how big will each of these things be".
