1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,650
Let's now talk about what is
easily one of the most famous

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,230
theorems in all of
mathematics.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,230
And that's the Pythagorean
theorem.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:18,440
   

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,980
And it deals with
right triangles.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:28,040
So a right triangle is a
triangle that has a 90 degree

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,000
angle in it.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,340
So the way I drew it
right here, this is

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,330
our 90 degree angle.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,320
If you've never seen a 90 degree
angle before, the way

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,700
to think about it is, if this
side goes straight left to

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,600
right, this side goes straight
up and down.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,970
These sides are perpendicular,
or the angle between them is

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,110
90 degrees, or it is
a right angle.

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,990
And the Pythagorean theorem
tells us that if we're dealing

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,180
with a right triangle-- let me
write that down-- if we're

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,340
dealing with a right triangle--
not a wrong

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,640
triangle-- if we're dealing with
a right triangle, which

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,140
is a triangle that has a right
angle, or a 90 degree angle in

21
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,060
it, then the relationship
between their sides is this.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,670
So this side is a, this side
is b, and this side is c.

23
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,190
And remember, the c that we're
dealing with right here is the

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,510
side opposite the
90 degree angle.

25
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,430
It's important to keep track
of which side is which.

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,030
The Pythagorean theorem tells us
that if and only if this is

27
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,330
a right triangle, then a squared
plus b squared is

28
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,270
going to be equal
to c squared.

29
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,630
And we can use this
information.

30
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,960
If we know two of these, we
can then use this theorem,

31
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,440
this formula to solve
for the third.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,640
And I'll give you one more piece
of terminology here.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,600
This long side, the side that
is the longest side of our

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,650
right triangle, the side that
is opposite of our right

35
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,590
angle, this right here-- it's
c in this example-- this is

36
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,840
called a hypotenuse.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,400
   

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,090
A very fancy word for
a very simple idea.

39
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,050
The longest side of a right
triangle, the side that is

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,770
opposite the 90 degree angle,
is called the hypotentuse.

41
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,440
Now that we know the Pythagorean
theorem, let's

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,620
actually use it.

43
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,070
Because it's one thing to know
something, but it's a lot more

44
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,250
fun to use it.

45
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,860
So let's say I have the
following right triangle.

46
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,800
Let me draw it a little
bit neater than that.

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,240
   

48
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,770
It's a right triangle.

49
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,080
This side over here
has length 9.

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,950
This side over here
has length 7.

51
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,900
And my question is, what
is this side over here?

52
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,130
Maybe we can call that--
we'll call that c.

53
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,710
Well, c, in this case, once
again, it is the hypotenuse.

54
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,640
It is the longest side.

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
So we know that the sum of the
squares of the other side is

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,140
going to be equal
to c squared.

57
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:13,900
So by the Pythagorean theorem,
9 squared plus 7 squared is

58
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,510
going to be equal
to c squared.

59
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:24,260
9 squared is 81, plus
7 squared is 49.

60
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,130
80 plus 40 is 120.

61
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,630
Then we're going to have the 1
plus the 9, that's another 10,

62
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,260
so this is going to
be equal to 130.

63
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,660
So let me write it this way.

64
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,290
The left-hand side is going to
be equal to 130, and that is

65
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,600
equal to c squared.

66
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,280
So what's c going
to be equal to?

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,170
Let me rewrite it over here.

68
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,550
c squared is equal to 130, or
we could say that c is equal

69
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,330
to the square root of 130.

70
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,610
And notice, I'm only taking
the principal root here,

71
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,210
because c has to be positive.

72
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,580
We're dealing with a distance,
so we can't take the negative

73
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,120
square root.

74
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,400
So we'll only take
the principal

75
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
square root right here.

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,716
And if we want to simplify this
a little bit, we know how

77
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:09,960
to simplify our radicals.

78
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:18,899
130 is 2 times 65, which
is 5 times 13.

79
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,910
Well, these are all prime
numbers, so that's about as

80
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,740
simple as I can get.
c is equal to the

81
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,820
square root of 130.

82
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,130
Let's do another one of these.

83
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,930
Maybe I want to keep this
Pythagorean theorem right

84
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,830
there, just so we always
remember what

85
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,400
we're referring to.

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,490
So let's say I have a triangle
that looks like this.

87
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,260
Let's see.

88
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,720
Let's say it looks like that.

89
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,460
   

90
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,720
And this is the right
angle, up here.

91
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,160
Let's say that this side,
I'm going to call it a.

92
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,140
The side, it's going
to have length 21.

93
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,450
And this side right here is
going to be of length 35.

94
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,800
So your instinct to solve for a,
might say, hey, 21 squared

95
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,710
plus 35 squared is going to
be equal to a squared.

96
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,930
But notice, in this situation,
35 is a hypotenuse.

97
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,390
35 is our c.

98
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,590
It's the longest side of
our right triangle.

99
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,010
So what the Pythagorean theorem
tells us is that a

100
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,800
squared plus the other
non-longest side-- the other

101
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,970
non-hypotenuse squared-- so a
squared plus 21 squared is

102
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,190
going to be equal
to 35 squared.

103
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,540
You always have to remember, the
c squared right here, the

104
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,500
c that we're talking about, is
always going to be the longest

105
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,450
side of your right triangle.

106
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,020
The side that is opposite
of our right angle.

107
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,060
This is the side that's opposite
of the right angle.

108
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,610
So a squared plus 21 squared
is equal to 35 squared.

109
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,100
And what do we have here?

110
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,740
So 21 squared-- I'm tempted to
use a calculator, but I won't.

111
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:06,530
So 21 times 21: 1 times 21
is 21, 2 times 21 is 42.

112
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,510
It is 441.

113
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,600
35 squared.

114
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,860
Once again, I'm tempted to use
a calculator, but I won't.

115
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,700
35 times 35: 5 times 5 is 25.

116
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,280
Carry the 2.

117
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,400
5 times 3 is 15, plus 2 is 17.

118
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,840
Put a 0 here, get rid
of that thing.

119
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,130
3 times 5 is 15.

120
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,030
3 times 3 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

121
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:44,210
So it is 11-- let me do it in
order-- 5 plus 0 is 5, 7 plus

122
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,070
5 is 12, 1 plus 1 is 2,
bring down the 1.

123
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,670
1225.

124
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:58,540
So this tells us that a squared
plus 441 is going to

125
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,450
be equal to 35 squared,
which is 1225.

126
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,300
Now, we could subtract
441 from both

127
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,550
sides of this equation.

128
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,350
   

129
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,760
The left-hand side just
becomes a squared.

130
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,510
The right-hand side,
what do we get?

131
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,210
We get 5 minus 1 is 4.

132
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,793
We want to-- let me write this
a little bit neater here.

133
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:29,980
   

134
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,810
Minus 441.

135
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,260
So the left-hand side, once
again, they cancel out. a

136
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,110
squared is equal to-- and then
on the right-hand side, what

137
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,440
do we have to do?

138
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,380
That's larger than that, but 2
is not larger than 4, so we're

139
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,020
going to have to borrow.

140
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,660
So that becomes a 12, or
regrouped, depending on how

141
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,320
you want to view it.

142
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,710
That becomes a 1.

143
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,780
1 is not greater than
4, so we're going to

144
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,110
have to borrow again.

145
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,800
Get rid of that.

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,170
And then this becomes an 11.

147
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,100
5 minus 1 is 4.

148
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,780
12 minus 4 is 8.

149
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,850
11 minus 4 is 7.

150
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,640
So a squared is equal to 784.

151
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,380
And we could write, then,
that a is equal to the

152
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,910
square root of 784.

153
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,800
And once again, I'm very tempted
to use a calculator,

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,710
but let's, well, let's not.

155
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,630
Let's not use it.

156
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,880
So this is 2 times, what?

157
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,400
392.

158
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,890
And then this-- 390 times
2 is 78, yeah.

159
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,390
And then this is
2 times, what?

160
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,790
This is 2 times 196.

161
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,900
That's right.

162
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,680
190 times 2 is-- yeah,
that's 2 times 196.

163
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,060
196 is 2 times-- I want to
make sure I don't make a

164
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,760
careless mistake.

165
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,200
196 is 2 times 98.

166
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,230
Let's keep going down here.

167
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:16,850
98 is 2 times 49.

168
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,540
And, of course, we know
what that is.

169
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,120
So notice, we have 2 times
2, times 2, times 2.

170
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,000
So this is 2 to the
fourth power.

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,680
So it's 16 times 49.

172
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,220
So a is equal to the square
root of 16 times 49.

173
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,990
I picked those numbers because
they're both perfect squares.

174
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,480
So this is equal to the square
root of 16 is 4, times the

175
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,930
square root of 49 is 7.

176
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,260
It's equal to 28.

177
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,800
So this side right here is going
to be equal to 28, by

178
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,980
the Pythagorean theorem.

179
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,650
Let's do one more of these.

180
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,770
Can never get enough practice.

181
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,760
So let's say I have
another triangle.

182
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,680
I'll draw this one big.

183
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,330
There you go.

184
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,380
That's my triangle.

185
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,160
That is the right angle.

186
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,870
This side is 24.

187
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,390
This side is 12.

188
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,000
We'll call this side
right here b.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,900
Now, once again, always identify
the hypotenuse.

190
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,270
That's the longest side,
the side opposite

191
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,070
the 90 degree angle.

192
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,620
You might say, hey, I don't know
that's the longest side.

193
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,020
I don't know what b is yet.

194
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,980
How do I know this is longest?

195
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,670
And there, in that situation,
you say, well, it's the side

196
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,380
opposite the 90 degree angle.

197
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:31,070
So if that's the hypotenuse,
then this squared plus that

198
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,680
squared is going to be
equal to 24 squared.

199
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,370
So the Pythagorean theorem-- b
squared plus 12 squared is

200
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,100
equal to 24 squared.

201
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,930
Or we could subtract 12 squared
from both sides.

202
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:50,350
We say, b squared is equal to
24 squared minus 12 squared,

203
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,200
which we know is 144, and that
b is equal to the square root

204
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,660
of 24 squared minus
12 squared.

205
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,490
Now I'm tempted to use a
calculator, and I'll give into

206
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,990
the temptation.

207
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,770
So let's do it.

208
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,550
The last one was so painful,
I'm still recovering.

209
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:20,350
So 24 squared minus 12 squared
is equal to 24.78.

210
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,110
So this actually turns into--
let me do it without a-- well,

211
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,730
I'll do it halfway.

212
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:30,390
24 squared minus 12 squared
is equal to 432.

213
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:37,000
So b is equal to the
square root of 432.

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,080
And let's factor this again.

215
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,680
We saw what the answer is, but
maybe we can write it in kind

216
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,830
of a simplified radical form.

217
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,090
So this is 2 times 216.

218
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,740
216, I believe, is
a-- let me see.

219
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,570
I believe that's a
perfect square.

220
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,460
So let me take the square
root of 216.

221
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,550
Nope, not a perfect square.

222
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,940
So 216, let's just keep going.

223
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,700
216 is 2 times 108.

224
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,220
108 is, we could say,
4 times what?

225
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:18,050
25 plus another 2-- 4 times
27, which is 9 times 3.

226
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,470
So what do we have here?

227
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,550
We have 2 times 2, times 4, so
this right here is a 16.

228
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,430
16 times 9 times 3.

229
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,720
Is that right?

230
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,260
I'm using a different
calculator.

231
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:35,580
16 times 9 times 3
is equal to 432.

232
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,700
So this is going to be equal
to-- b is equal to the square

233
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,490
root of 16 times 9, times 3,
which is equal to the square

234
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,450
root of 16, which is 4 times the
square root of 9, which is

235
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,660
3, times the square root
of 3, which is equal

236
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,420
to 12 roots of 3.

237
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,540
So b is 12 times the
square root of 3.

238
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,560
Hopefully you found
that useful.
