1
00:00:04,869 --> 00:00:07,210
- We're looking at one of the single canvases

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,398
from a series of canvases of the "Campbell's Soup Cans"

3
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:13,734
by Andy Warhol from 1962 at the Museum of Modern Art.

4
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:16,337
One of the really important questions that comes up

5
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:19,208
especially about modern art, is:

6
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:23,072
-When you ask me that,

7
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:25,148
a bunch of things surface in my brain.

8
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:26,784
It does evoke something in me,

9
00:00:26,784 --> 00:00:28,586
so I'm inclined to say yes,

10
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:30,087
but then there's a bunch of other things

11
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:31,789
that say if I didn't see this in a museum;

12
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:35,392
if I just saw this in the marketing department of Cambell's Soup,

13
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:37,094
would you be viewing it differently?

14
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:38,829
- Because it's advertising then. (Yes)

15
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,631
But in the context of the museum,

16
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:42,902
or in the context of Andy Warhol's studio,

17
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:45,135
it's not quite advertising, right?

18
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:47,538
-Even if it's the exact same thing? (Yeah!)

19
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:50,441
And the idea here is, by putting it in the museum

20
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:52,376
and saying "look at this in a different way"?

21
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:54,945
-Well that's right. It really does relocate it.

22
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:58,015
It does change the meaning. It does transform it.

23
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,317
That's really one of the central ideas of modern art

24
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:01,896
is that you can take something

25
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,239
that's not necessarily based in technical skill

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,748
- because I don't think you would say that this is beautifully rendered -

27
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:11,103
but it relocates it and makes us think about it in a different way.

28
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:14,231
-So, I guess, he would get credit

29
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:17,066
for taking something that was very, almost mundane,

30
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,503
something you see in everyone's cupboard,

31
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:21,905
and making it a focal point.

32
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:23,873
Like, you should pay attention to this thing.

33
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:25,442
-I think that's exactly right.

34
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,878
And I think that he's doing it about a subject

35
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:31,071
that was about as low a subject as one could go.

36
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:34,497
I mean, cheap advertising art was so far away

37
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:37,288
from fine art, from the great masters,

38
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:40,123
and then to focus on something as lowly

39
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:41,592
as a can of soup

40
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:43,460
-- and cream of chicken, no less --

41
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,765
-And a lot of it is: if he did it 50 years earlier,

42
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:49,633
people would have thought this guy is a quack

43
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:50,668
and if he did it now,

44
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:52,655
people would think he's just derivative

45
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:56,040
and I mean it was really just that time where people

46
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,641
happened to think this was art.

47
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:58,813
-Well I think that that's right.

48
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:02,426
In 1962, what Warhol is doing is, he is saying:

49
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:10,124
It was about mass production, it was about factory,

50
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:13,461
he in a sense said: "Let's not be looking at nature..."

51
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:15,430
"...as if we were still an agrarian culture."...

52
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,071
..."We are now an industrial culture."...

53
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,971
"...What is the stuff of our visual world now?"

54
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:21,886
-I think I'm 80% there.

55
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:22,604
I remember in college

56
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:25,164
there was a little student-run art exhibit

57
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:26,565
and as a prank,

58
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:29,105
a student actually put a little podium there

59
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,636
and put his lunch tray.

60
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:32,356
He put a little plaquard next to it

61
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:34,349
"Lunch Tray on Saturday" or something

62
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:36,284
is what he called it. So he did it as a prank

63
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:37,682
and everyone thought it was really funny,

64
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,372
But to some degree it's kind of sounding like

65
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:41,007
maybe what he did was art?

66
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:42,408
-Well I think that's why it was so funny

67
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:43,476
because it was so close.

68
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:45,578
-And to some degree, when someone took a lunch tray,

69
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:47,374
and gave it proper lighting

70
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:49,215
and gave it a podium to look at

71
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:51,041
and wrote a whole description about it,

72
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,819
I did view the lunch tray in a different way.

73
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,386
That is kind of the same idea.

74
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:56,789
Something that is such a mundane thing, but you use it every day.

75
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:58,958
What would you say to that?

76
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,470
Is it a prank, or is it art?

77
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,630
-Well I think it is a prank,

78
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,296
but it is also very close to some important art

79
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,997
that had been made earlier in the century.

80
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:06,666
He had license to do that because of

81
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,457
somebody named Marcel Duchamp.

82
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:11,671
In fact, Warhol had, in a sense, the same kind of license,

83
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:14,374
to not focus on the making of something

84
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:15,908
not focus on the brushwork,

85
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:17,467
not focus on the composition,

86
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:18,719
not focus on the color,

87
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,762
but focus on the re-focusing of ideas.

88
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:24,386
-And the reason why we talk about Warhol

89
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:26,419
or Duchamp or any of these people

90
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,887
is that, as you said,

91
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:29,789
it's not like they did something technically profound.

92
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,491
Obviously Campbell's Soup's marketing department

93
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:35,114
had already done something as equally as profound,

94
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,621
it's more that they were the people

95
00:03:37,621 --> 00:03:39,832
who looked at the world in a slightly different way

96
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:41,300
and highlighted that?

97
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,637
-I think that that's right.

98
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:46,306
Warhol was also very conciously working towards

99
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:48,074
asking the same questions

100
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:49,616
the prankster at your school was asking.

101
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:52,673
He's saying, "Can this be art?"

102
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:54,399
and in fact, he's really pushing it.

103
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,128
Look at the painting closely for a moment.

104
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:57,430
This is one of the last paintings

105
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,904
that he has actually painted.

106
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:02,101
He's really defined the calligraphy of this Campbell's.

107
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:05,576
He's really sort of rendered the reflection of the tin at the top.

108
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,131
But then he stopped.

109
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,177
He said, "I don't want to paint the fleur-de-lis."

110
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:11,847
You see those little fleur-de-lis down at the bottom?

111
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:13,326
He said, "I don't want to paint those."

112
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:14,950
So he actually had a little rubber stamp made of them

113
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,953
and placed them down mechanically.

114
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,787
What does that mean for an artist, then,

115
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:21,789
to say "I don't even want to bother to paint these..."

116
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:25,484
"... I'm just going to find a mechanical process to make this easier."?

117
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:27,229
Warhol is doing something which I think is important

118
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,731
which is reflecting the way we manufacture,

119
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:31,967
the way we construct our world.

120
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,618
Think about the things we surround ourselves with.

121
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:38,019
Almost everything was made in a factory.

122
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,645
Almost nothing is singular in the world anymore.

123
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:43,130
It's not a world where we would normally find beautiful.

124
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,817
-I don't know, sometimes I feel,

125
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:45,885
and correct me if I'm wrong,

126
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,789
that a decision was made that Warhol

127
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,622
was interesting or great,

128
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:54,327
and people will interpret his stuff to justify his greatness.

129
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:58,498
That, 'oh, look, he used a printer instead of drawing it'

130
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:02,001
which shows he was reflecting the industrial whatever

131
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,569
but then if he'd done the other way,

132
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,938
if he'd hand-drawn it, or hand-drawn it with his elbow

133
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,508
or you know, finger painted it or something

134
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,809
people would say "isn't this tremendous?"

135
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,706
..."You would normally see this thing printed by a machine..."

136
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:13,212
but now he did it with his hands!"

137
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,214
How much do you think that is the case?

138
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,016
Or do you think I'm just being cynical?

139
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:21,020
-Well, no, I think there's value in a certain degree of cynicism

140
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,822
and I think that in some ways,

141
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,824
what we're really talking about here is:

142
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,826
"what does it mean to be an Avant-Garde artist?"

143
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,428
What does it mean to change the language of art

144
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:34,043
and try to find ways that art relates to our historical moment

145
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,536
in some direct and authentic way?

146
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,204
-Maybe it's easy for me to say this

147
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:43,075
because I remember looking at this when I took 5th grade art class;

148
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:47,789
Andy Warhol and all that so now it seems almost not that unique.

149
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:50,111
But in '62 what I'm hearing is

150
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:51,551
that Warhol was really noteworthy

151
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,486
because he really did push people's thinking.

152
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,922
-I think that Warhol was looking for,

153
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,124
in 1962, a kind of subject matter

154
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,093
that was completely outside of the scope

155
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,895
that we could consider fine art.

156
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,879
One of his contemporaries, Roy Lichtenstein,

157
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,690
was asked what Pop Art was.

158
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,801
He said, "Well, we were looking for subject matter..."

159
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,304
"...that was so despicable, that was so low..."

160
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,306
"... that nobody could possibly believe..."

161
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,674
"... that it was really art."

162
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,342
And I think you are right.

163
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,476
I think now we look at it

164
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:19,045
and it's so much a part of our visual culture

165
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,513
that we immediatley accept it.

166
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,381
I think it's interesting to retrieve

167
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,318
just how shocking and radical that was.

168
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,086
-This is fascinating.

169
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,121
It seems like there is a lot of potential there.

170
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,485
That stuff that is pseudo-art made for other purposes,

171
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:33,793
for commerical purposes,

172
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,428
but if you kind of shine a light on it

173
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,965
in the way that a light has been shown on this, it does --

174
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:42,328
in your mind would that cross the barrier into being art?

175
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:45,438
--Well, you mentioned before

176
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,139
that if somebody was doing this now,

177
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,708
it would feel very derivative.

178
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,942
I think that that's right.

179
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,510
I think it underscores just how hard

180
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,146
it is to find in our culture now,

181
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:57,350
ways of making us see the world in new ways.

182
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,777
-Fascinating.
