1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
   

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,050
We've learned a good bit
about the dot product.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,110
But when I first introduced it,
I mentioned that this was

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,730
only one type of vector
multiplication, and the other

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,150
type is the cross product, which
you're probably familiar

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,840
with from your vector calculus
course or from

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,090
your physics course.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,120
   

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,030
But the cross product is
actually much more limited

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,940
than the dot product.

11
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,280
It's useful, but it's
much more limited.

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,970
The dot product is defined
in any dimension.

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,810
So this is defined for any two
vectors that are in Rn.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,160
You could take the dot product
of vectors that have two

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,650
components.

16
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,020
You could take the dot product
of vectors that have a million

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,840
components.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:55,430
The cross product is
only defined in R3.

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,960
And the other, I guess, major
difference is the dot produc,

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,350
and we're going to see this in a
second when I define the dot

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,370
product for you, I haven't
defined it yet.

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,140
The dot product results
in a scalar.

23
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,850
You take the dot product
of two vectors,

24
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,240
you just get a number.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,960
But in the cross product you're
going to see that we're

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,130
going to get another vector.

27
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,185
And the vector we're going to
get is actually going to be a

28
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:17,570
vector that's orthogonal to
the two vectors that we're

29
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,230
taking the cross product of.

30
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,580
So now that I have you excited
with anticipation, let me

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,370
define it for you.

32
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,300
And you probably already have
seen this once or twice in

33
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,960
your mathematical careers.

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,200
Let's say I have the vector a.

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,680
It has to be in R3, so
it only has three

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,510
components: a1, a2 and a3.

37
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,050
And I'm going to cross that with
the vector b and it has

38
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:46,910
three components:
b1, b2 and b3.

39
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:54,650
a cross b is defined
as a third vector.

40
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,360
And now this is going to seem a
little bit bizarre and hard

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,500
to essentially memorize because
this is a definition.

42
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,120
But I'll show you how I think
about it when I have my

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,220
vectors written in
this column form.

44
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,960
If you watch the physics
playlist, I have a bunch of

45
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,400
videos on the cross product
and I show you how I think

46
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,070
about the cross product when I
have it in the i, j, k form.

47
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,620
But when I have it like this,
the way you think about this

48
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,880
first term up here, this is
going to be another three

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,550
vector or another vector in R3,
so it's going to have 1,

50
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,320
2, 3 terms.

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,570
For the first term, what you do
is you ignore these top two

52
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,330
terms of this vector and then
you look at the bottom two and

53
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,670
you say, a2 times b3
minus a3 times b2.

54
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,800
   

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,790
And I've made a few videos on
determinants, although I

56
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,500
haven't formally done them in
kind of this linear algebra

57
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,490
playlist yet.

58
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,260
But if you remember kind of
co-factor-- finding out the

59
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,410
co-factor terms for when
you're determining the

60
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,780
determinant or if you're just
taking the determinant for a

61
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,260
2x2 matrix, this might
seem very familiar.

62
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,740
So this first term right here is
essentially the determinant

63
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,770
of-- if you get rid of this
first row out of both of these

64
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,370
guys right here, you take a2
times b3 minus a3 times b2.

65
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:19,890
So it's a2 times b3
minus a3 times b2.

66
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,110
That was hopefully pretty
straightforward.

67
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,600
Now, not to make your life any
more complicated, when you do

68
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,100
the second, when you do the
middle row, when you do this

69
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,150
one right here, so you
cross that out.

70
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,150
And you might want to do a1
times b3 minus a3 times b1.

71
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,380
And that would be natural
because that's

72
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,380
what we did up there.

73
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,800
But the middle row you
do the opposite.

74
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,310
You do a3 times b1 minus
a1 times b3.

75
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,890
Or you can kind of view it as
the negative of what you would

76
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,180
have done naturally.

77
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,310
So you would have done
a1 b3 minus a3 b1.

78
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:02,490
Now we're going to do
a3 b1 minus a1 b3.

79
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,140
   

80
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,640
And that was only for
that middle row.

81
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,120
And then, for the bottom
row, we cross that out

82
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,300
again or ignore it.

83
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,490
And we do a1 times b2, just like
we do with the first row.

84
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,000
   

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,980
Times a2 b1.

86
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,930
Or minus a2 b1.

87
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,920
This seems all hard to-- and
it is hard to remember.

88
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,280
That's why I kind of have to get
that system in place like

89
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,130
I just talked to you about.

90
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,650
But this might seem pretty
bizarre and hairy.

91
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,870
So let me do a couple of
examples with you, just so you

92
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,390
get the hang of our definition
of the dot product in R3.

93
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,200
So let's say that I have the
vector-- let's say I'm

94
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,950
crossing the vector.

95
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,730
I have the vector 1,
minus 7, and 1.

96
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:58,180
And I'm going to cross that
with the vector 5, 2, 4.

97
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,475
So this is going to be equal
to a third vector.

98
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:03,810
   

99
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,920
Let me get some space to
do my mathematics.

100
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,170
So for the first element in
this vector, the first

101
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,950
component, we just ignore the
first components of these

102
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:20,610
vectors and we say minus 7
times 4 minus 1 times 2.

103
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,180
   

104
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,680
And these are just regular
multiplication.

105
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,830
I'm not taking the
dot product.

106
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,570
These are just regular
numbers.

107
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,050
Then for the middle term, we
ignore the middle terms here

108
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,660
and then we do the opposite.

109
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:39,270
We do 1 times 5 minus
1 times 4.

110
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,120
   

111
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,410
Remember, you might have been
tempted to do 1 times 4 minus

112
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,380
1 times 5 because that's how we
essentially did it in the

113
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:48,900
first term.

114
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,240
But the middle term
is the opposite.

115
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,290
And then finally, the third
term you ignore the third

116
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,030
terms here and then you do it
just like the first term.

117
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,260
You start in the top left.

118
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:04,340
1 times 2 minus 7.

119
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,240
Put that in parentheses.

120
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,500
Minus minus 7 times 5.

121
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,070
And so that is equal
to-- let me see.

122
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,500
What do we get?

123
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,580
Minus 7 times 4.

124
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,890
I don't want to make a careless
mistake here.

125
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,960
That's minus 28.

126
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,880
Minus 2.

127
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,490
So this is minus 30 for
that first term.

128
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,540
This one is 5 minus 4.

129
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,500
   

130
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,530
5 minus 4 is just 1.

131
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:43,430
And then 2 minus minus 35.

132
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,680
So 2 minus minus 35.

133
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,690
That's 2 plus 35.

134
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,370
That's 37.

135
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,220
So there you go.

136
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,280
Hopefully you understand at
least the mechanics of the

137
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,400
cross product.

138
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,950
So the next thing you're
saying well, OK.

139
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,000
I can find the cross product
of two things.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,790
But what is this good for?

141
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,400
What does this do for me?

142
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,580
And the answer is, is that this
third vector right here,

143
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,170
and depending on whether I stay
in the abstract case or

144
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,600
whether this case with numbers,
this is orthogonal to

145
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,680
the two vectors that we took
the cross product of.

146
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,920
So this vector right here is
orthogonal to a and b.

147
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,810
   

148
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,330
Which is pretty neat.

149
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,210
If you just go think about the
last video when we were

150
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,250
talking about normal vectors
to a plane, we can define a

151
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,080
vector by-- we can define
a plane by two vectors.

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,130
If we define a plane-- let's say
that I have vector a right

153
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,020
there, and then I
have vector b.

154
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,680
Let me do vector b like this.

155
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,650
Those define a plane in R3.

156
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,510
Let me define your plane.

157
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,530
So all the linear combinations
of those two guys, that's a

158
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,010
plane in R3.

159
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,370
You can kind of view it
as they might form

160
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,940
a subspace in R3.

161
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,630
That forms a plane.

162
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,070
If you take a cross b, you
get a third vector that's

163
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,840
orthogonal to those two.

164
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,070
And so a cross b will
pop out like this.

165
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,310
It'll be orthogonal to both of
them and look like that.

166
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,940
And so this vector right
there is a cross b.

167
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,500
And you might say, Sal, how did
you know-- I mean, there's

168
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,070
multiple vectors that
are orthogonal.

169
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,960
Obviously, the length of the
vector, and I didn't specify

170
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,900
that there, but it could pop
straight up like that or why

171
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,630
didn't it-- you know, you just
as easily could have popped

172
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,610
straight down like that.

173
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,130
That also would be orthogonal
to a and b.

174
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,190
And the way that a cross b is
defined, you can essentially

175
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,930
figure out the direction
visually by using what's

176
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,390
called the right hand rule.

177
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,880
And the way I think about it
is you take your right hand

178
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,290
and let me see if I can draw
a suitable right hand.

179
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,320
Point your index finger
in the direction of a.

180
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,910
So if your index finger is in
the direction of a and then I

181
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,340
point my middle finger in
the direction of b.

182
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,150
So my middle finger, in this
case, is going to go

183
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,370
something like that.

184
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,250
My middle finger is going to
do something like that.

185
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,560
And then my other fingers
do nothing.

186
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:18,780
Then my thumb will go in the
direction of a cross b.

187
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,710
You could see that there.

188
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,750
My thumb is in the direction
of a cross b.

189
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,890
And assuming that you are
anatomically similar to me,

190
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,860
then you still get
the same result.

191
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,270
Let me draw it all.

192
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,810
So this is vector a.

193
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,320
Vector b goes in
that direction.

194
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,010
Hopefully you don't have a
thumb hanging down here.

195
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,480
You know that a cross b in this
example will point up and

196
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,160
it's orthogonal to both.

197
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,740
To kind of satisfy you a little
bit, that the vector's

198
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,570
definitely orthogonal or that
this thing is definitely

199
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,720
orthogonal to both of these,
let's just play with it and

200
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,960
see that that definitely
is the case.

201
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,500
And what is orthogonal?

202
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,490
What is in our context, the
definition of orthogonal?

203
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,740
Orthogonal vectors.

204
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,240
   

205
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,040
If a and b are orthogonal, that
means that a dot b is

206
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,770
equal to 0.

207
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,490
Remember, the difference
between orthogonal and

208
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,090
perpendicular is that
orthogonal also

209
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,340
applies to 0 vectors.

210
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,550
So these could also
be 0 vectors.

211
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,910
Notice that I didn't say that
any of these guys up here had

212
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,140
to be nonzero.

213
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,450
Well, in a little bit, we'll
talk about the angle between

214
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,280
vectors and then you have
to assume nonzero.

215
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,290
But if you're just taking a
cross product, nothing to stop

216
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,580
you from taking-- no reason
why any of these

217
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,180
numbers can't be 0.

218
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,530
But let me show you that
a cross b is definitely

219
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,710
orthogonal to both a and b.

220
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,220
I think that might be somewhat
satisfying to you.

221
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,780
So let me copy a cross b here.

222
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,710
I don't feel like
rewriting it.

223
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,250
OK.

224
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,500
Let me paste it.

225
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,310
OK, bundle up little other
stuff with it.

226
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,940
   

227
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,800
Let me take the dot product of
that with just my vector a,

228
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,730
which was just a1, a2, a3.

229
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,530
So what does the dot
product look like?

230
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,260
That term times that, so it's
a1-- let me get some space.

231
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:31,710
It's a1 times a2 b3 minus
a1 times that.

232
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:37,350
Minus a1 times a3 b2.

233
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,110
And then you have plus
this times this.

234
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,670
So plus a2 times a3.

235
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,530
So plus a2 times a3 times b1.

236
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:55,720
And then minus a2 a1 b3.

237
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,180
And then finally, plus-- I'll
just continue it down here.

238
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:10,050
Plus a3 times a1 b2 minus
a3 times a2 b1.

239
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,680
All I did I just took the
cross-- the dot product of

240
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,590
these two things.

241
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,750
I just took each of this.

242
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,010
This guy times that was equal
to those two terms. That guy

243
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,370
times that was equal to the next
two terms, equal to those

244
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,840
two terms. And then this guy
times that was equal to those

245
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,740
two terms. And if these guys
are really orthogonal, then

246
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,280
this should be equal to 0.

247
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,020
So let's see if that's
the case.

248
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,030
So I have an a1 a2 b3, a
positive here, and then I'm

249
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,640
subtracting the same
thing here.

250
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,940
This is the same thing as a1 a2
b3, but it's just a minus.

251
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,380
So that will cancel
out with that.

252
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,460
Let's see, what else
do we have?

253
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,670
We have a minus a1 a3 b2.

254
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,740
We have a plus a1 a3 b2 there,
so these two are going to

255
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,950
cancel out.

256
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,970
And I think you see where
this is going.

257
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,960
You have a positive a2 a3 b1 and
then you have a negative

258
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,050
a2 a3 b1 there.

259
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,790
So these will also cancel out.

260
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,370
Now, I just showed you that
it's orthogonal to a.

261
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,110
Let me show you that it's
orthogonal to b.

262
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:17,680
Let me get another version of
my-- the cross product of the

263
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,940
two vectors.

264
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,640
Probably scroll down
a little bit.

265
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,730
And let me go back.

266
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,570
And let me multiply that
times the vector b.

267
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,440
b1, b2 and b3.

268
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,700
I'll do it here just so
I have some space.

269
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:43,430
So b1 times this whole thing
right here is b1 a2 b3 minus

270
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,530
b1 times this.

271
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,360
Minus b1 a3 b2.

272
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,350
Let me switch colors.

273
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,420
And then b2 times this thing
here is going to be b2-- so

274
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,690
it's going to be plus.

275
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,630
This is all really one
expression, I'm just writing

276
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,430
it on multiple lines.

277
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,630
This isn't a vector.

278
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,030
Remember, when you take the dot
product of two things, you

279
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,990
get a scalar quantity.

280
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,020
So plus b2 times this thing.

281
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:14,450
So b2 a3 b1 minus b2 a1 b3.

282
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,730
And then finally,
b3 times this.

283
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:30,620
So plus b3 a1 b2
minus b3 a2 b1.

284
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,970
So if these guys are definitely
orthogonal, then

285
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,460
this thing needs to equal 0.

286
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,620
And let's see if that's
the case.

287
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,400
We have a b1, a2, b3.

288
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,750
So b1 and a b3.

289
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,430
b1 a2 b3, that's a positive
one and this

290
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,190
is a negative one.

291
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,860
You have a b3, an a2 and a b1
so that and that cancel out.

292
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,310
Here you have a minus
b1 a3 b2.

293
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,550
So you have a b1 and a b2.

294
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,110
It's a minus b1 a3 b2.

295
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,530
This is a plus the same thing.

296
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,400
Just switching the order
of the multiplication.

297
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,620
But these two are
the same term.

298
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,560
They're just opposites of each
other, so they cancel out.

299
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,740
And then finally, you have
a b2, an a1 and a b3.

300
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,410
It's a negative.

301
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,000
And then you have a positive
version of the same thing.

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,990
So these two guys cancel out.

303
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,860
So you see that this
is also equal to 0.

304
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,360
So hopefully you're satisfied
that this vector right here is

305
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,800
definitely orthogonal
to both a and b.

306
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,610
And that's because that's
how it was designed.

307
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,980
This is a definition.

308
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,510
You could do a little bit of
algebra and you could have

309
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,680
without me explaining this
definition to you, you could

310
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,440
have actually come up with this
definition on your own.

311
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
But obviously this was kind
of designed to have other

312
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
