1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,150
In most topics you have to get
pretty advanced before you

2
00:00:03,173 --> 00:00:05,410
start addressing the
philosophically interesting

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,460
things, but in chemistry it
just starts right from the

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,490
get-go with what's arguably
the most philosophically

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,000
interesting part of the whole
topic, and that's the atom.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,910
And the idea of the atom, as
philosophers long ago, and you

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,855
could look it up on the
different philosophers who

8
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,540
first philosophized about it,
they said, hey, you know, if I

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,460
started off with, I don't know,
if I started off with an apple

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,598
if I started of with a apple

11
00:00:29,598 --> 00:00:32,720
and I just kept cutting
the apple -- let me draw a

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,305
nice looking apple just so
it doesn't look just

13
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:37,015
like a heart .

14
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:37,915
There you go.

15
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:39,507
You have a nice looking apple,
And you just kept cutting it,

16
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:40,124
smaller and smaller pieces.

17
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:45,047
So eventually, you get a piece
so small, so tiny, that you

18
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:46,080
can't cut it anymore.

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,190
And I'm sure some of these
philosophers went out there

20
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,700
with a knife and tried to do
it and they just felt that,

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,685
oh, if I could just get my knife
a little bit sharper, I

22
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:53,720
could cut it again and again.

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,560
So it's a completely
philosophical construct, which

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,380
frankly, in a lot of ways, isn't
too different to how the

25
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,440
atom is today.

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,709
It's really just a mental
abstraction that allows us to

27
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,500
describe a lot of observations
we see in the universe.

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,380
But anyway, these philosophers
said, well, at some point we

29
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,320
think that there's going to be
some little part of an apple

30
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,980
that they won't be able
to divide anymore.

31
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,000
And they called that an atom.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,820
And it doesn't just have to just
be for an apple they said

33
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,550
this is true for any substance
or any element to that you

34
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,150
encounter in the universe.

35
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,830
And so the word atom is really
Greek for uncuttable.

36
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,036
Uncuttable or indivisible.

37
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:34,859
Uncuttable.

38
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,680
Now we know that it actually is
cuttable and even though it

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,970
is not a trivial thing, it's
not the smallest form of

40
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,730
matter we know.

41
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,060
We now know that an atom is
made up of other more

42
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,570
fundamental particles.

43
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,260
And let me write that.

44
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,780
So the we have the neutron.

45
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,050
And I'll draw in a second how
they all fit together and the

46
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,730
structure of an atom.

47
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,520
We have a neutron.

48
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,780
We have a proton.

49
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,150
And we have electrons.

50
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,100
Electrons.

51
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,250
And you might already be
familiar with this if you look

52
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,410
at old videos about atomic
projects, you'll see a drawing

53
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,285
that looks something
like this.

54
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:21,940
Let me see if I can draw one.

55
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,340
So you'll have something
like that.

56
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,300
And you'll have these things
spinning around

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,800
that look like this.

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,430
They have orbits that
look like that.

59
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,840
And maybe something that
looks like that.

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,845
And the general notion behind
these kind of nuclear drawings

61
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:39,280
-- and I'm sure that they
still show up at some

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,530
government defense labs or
something like that -- is that

63
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,020
you have a nucleus at the
center of an atom.

64
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,090
You have a nucleus at the
center of an atom.

65
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,440
And we know that a nucleus
has neutrons and protons.

66
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,510
Neutrons and protons.

67
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,570
And we'll talk a little bit more
about which elements have

68
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,150
how many neutrons and
how many protons.

69
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,810
And then orbiting, and I'm going
to use the word orbit

70
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,550
right now, although we'll learn
in about two minutes

71
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,150
that the word orbit is actually
the incorrect or even

72
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,160
the mentally incorrect way
of visualizing what

73
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,200
an electron is doing.

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,190
But the old idea was that you
have these electrons that are

75
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,180
orbiting around the nucleus very
similar to the way the

76
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,850
Earth orbits around the
Sun or the moon

77
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,810
orbits around the Earth.

78
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,890
And it's been shown that
that's actually

79
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,900
a very wrong way.

80
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,720
And when we cover quantum
mechanics we'll learn why this

81
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,020
doesn't work, what are the
contradictions that emerge

82
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,500
when you try to model an
electron like a planet going

83
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,110
around the Sun.

84
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,920
But this was kind of the
original idea, and frankly I

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,840
think this is kind of the idea
that is the most mainstream

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,230
way of viewing an atom.

87
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,550
Now, I said an atom is
philosophically interesting.

88
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,910
Why is it philosophically
interesting?

89
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,200
Because what we now view as the
accepted way of viewing an

90
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,610
atom really starts to blur the
line between our physical

91
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,120
reality and everything in the
world is just information, and

92
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,180
there really isn't any such
thing as true matter or true

93
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,440
particles as the way we define
them in our everyday life.

94
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,950
You know, for me a particle,
oh, it looks

95
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,740
like a grain of sand.

96
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,149
I can pick it up, touch it.

97
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,730
While a wave, that could be like
a soundwave. It could be

98
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,670
just this change in
energy over time.

99
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,870
But we'll learn, especially when
we do quantum mechanics,

100
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,010
that it all gets jumbled up as
we start approaching the

101
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,970
scales or the size of an atom.

102
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,780
Anyway, I said this was an
incorrect way of doing it.

103
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,590
What's the correct way?

104
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,500
So it turns out-- this is a
picture, not a picture really,

105
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,140
this is also a depiction.

106
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,850
So it's an interesting question,
what I just said.

107
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,360
How can you have a picture
of an atom?

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,910
Because is actually turns out
that most wavelengths of

109
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,800
light, especially the visible
wavelengths of light, are much

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,540
larger than the size
of an atom.

111
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,400
Everything else we
quote-unquote, observe in

112
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,350
life, it's by reflected light.

113
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,900
But all of a sudden when you're
dealing with an atom,

114
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,480
reflected light you could almost
view it as too big, or

115
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,470
too blunt of an instrument with
which to observe an atom.

116
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,150
Anyway, this is a depiction
of a helium atom.

117
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,160
A helium atom has two protons
and two neutrons.

118
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,850
Or at least this helium
atom has two

119
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,520
protons and two neutrons.

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,580
And the way they depict it here
in the nucleus, right

121
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,800
there, maybe these are the two--
I'm assuming they're

122
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,210
using red for proton and
purple for neutron.

123
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,100
Purple seems like more
of a neutral color.

124
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,740
And they're sitting at the
center of this atom.

125
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,480
And then this whole haze around
there, those are the

126
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,370
two electrons that helium
has, or that at least

127
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,400
this helium atom has.

128
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,510
Maybe you could gain or
lose an electron.

129
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,510
But these are the
two electrons.

130
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,560
And you say, hey, Sal, how can
two electrons be this blur

131
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,330
that's kind of smeared
around this atom.

132
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,520
And that's where it gets
philosophically interesting.

133
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,070
So you cannot describe an
electron's path around a

134
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,770
nucleus with the traditional
orbit idea that we've

135
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,700
encountered when we look at
planets or if we just imagine

136
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,740
things at kind of
a larger scale.

137
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,840
It turns out that an electron,
you cannot know exactly its

138
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,680
momentum and location at any
given point in time.

139
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,870
All you can know is a
probability distribution of

140
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,640
where it is likely to be.

141
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,490
And the way they depicted
this, black is a higher

142
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,700
probability, so you're much
more likely to find the

143
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,580
electron here than
you are here.

144
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,750
But the electron really
could be anywhere.

145
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,690
It could even to be here, even
though it's completely white

146
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,670
there, with some very, very,
very, very, very low

147
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,660
probability.

148
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,180
And so this function of where an
electron is, this is called

149
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,720
an orbital.

150
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,430
Orbital.

151
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,120
Not to be confused with orbit.

152
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,600
Orbital.

153
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,100
Remember, an orbit was
something like this.

154
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,050
It's like Venus going
around the Sun.

155
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,750
So it's very physically easy
for us to imagine.

156
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,370
While an orbital is actually
a mathematical probability

157
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,570
function that tells
us where we're

158
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,920
likely to find an electron.

159
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,020
We'll deal a lot more with that
when we cover quantum

160
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,270
mechanics, but that's not going
to be in the scope of

161
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,670
this kind of introductory set
of chemistry lectures.

162
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,150
But it's interesting, right?

163
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,800
An electron's behavior is so
bizarre at that scale that you

164
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,780
can't-- I mean, to call it a
particle is almost misleading.

165
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,180
It is called a particle, but
it's not a particle in the

166
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,300
sense that we're used to
in our everyday life.

167
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,230
It's this thing that you can't
even say exactly where it is.

168
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,600
It can be anywhere
in this haze.

169
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,630
And we'll learn later that there
are different shapes of

170
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,160
the hazes is as we add more and
more electrons to an atom.

171
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,580
But to me, it starts to address
philosophical issues

172
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,340
of what matter even is, or do
the things we look at, how

173
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,150
real are they?

174
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,920
Or how real are they, at least
as we've defined reality?

175
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,750
Anyway I don't want to get
too philosophical on you.

176
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,520
But the whole notion of
electrons, protons, they're

177
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,090
all kind of predicated on
this notion of charge.

178
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,580
And we've talked about it before
when we learned about

179
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,890
Coulomb's law.

180
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,470
You could review Coulomb's laws
videos in the physics

181
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,810
playlist. But the idea
is that an electron

182
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,240
has a negative charge.

183
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,070
A proton, sometimes
written like that,

184
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,250
has a positive charge.

185
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,299
And a neutron has no charge.

186
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,830
And so that's what was tempting
about the original

187
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,590
model of an electron.

188
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,310
If they say, OK, if this thing
has positive charges, right?

189
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,050
So let's say this is two
neutrons and two protons.

190
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,585
Let's say it's a helium atom.

191
00:08:48,585 --> 00:08:51,050
Then we'll have some positive
charges here.

192
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,070
We have some negative
charges out here.

193
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,330
Opposite charges attract.

194
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:03,710
And so if these things had
some velocity, enough

195
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,350
velocity, they would orbit
around this, just the way a

196
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,310
planet will orbit
around the Sun.

197
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,200
But now we learn, even though
this is partially true, that

198
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:23,760
the further away an electron is
from the nucleus, it does

199
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,700
have more, it's true,
potential energy.

200
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,240
In that it will want to move
towards the nucleus, but

201
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,580
because of all the mechanics at
the quantum level, it won't

202
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,950
just do something simple like
move in a path like that, like

203
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,140
a comet would do around the Sun,
it actually has this kind

204
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,690
of wave-like behavior, where it
just has this probability

205
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,170
function that describes it.

206
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,680
But the further away
an orbital, it

207
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,280
does have more potential.

208
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,080
We're going to go a lot more
into that in future videos.

209
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,140
But anyway, how do you recognize
what an element is?

210
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,500
I've talked a lot about the
philosophy and all of that,

211
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,050
but how do I know that
this is helium?

212
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,230
Is it by the number of
neutrons it has?

213
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,220
Is it by the number
of protons it has?

214
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,070
Is it by the number
of electrons?

215
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,960
Well the answer is, it's by
the number of protons.

216
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,090
So if you know the number of
protons in an element, you

217
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,660
know what that element is.

218
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:21,760
And the number of protons,
this is defined

219
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,518
as the atomic number.

220
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:33,305
Now, so let's say I said
something has four protons.

221
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,520
How do we know what it is?

222
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,070
Well if we haven't memorized it,
we could look it up on the

223
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,560
periodic table of elements,
which we'll be dealing with a

224
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,210
lot in this playlist. And you'd
say, oh, four protons,

225
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,680
that is beryllium.

226
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,540
Right there.

227
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,150
And the atomic number is the
number that you see up there.

228
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,010
And that' s literally the
number of protons.

229
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,220
And that is what differentiates

230
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,160
one atom from another.

231
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,340
If you have fifteen protons,
you're dealing with

232
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,315
phosphorus.

233
00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:06,340
And all of a sudden, if you
have seven protons, you're

234
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,150
dealing with nitrogen.

235
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,060
If you have eight, you're
dealing with oxygen.

236
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,680
That is what defines
the element.

237
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,940
Now, we'll talk in the future
about what happens with charge

238
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,140
and all of that.

239
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,010
Or what happens when you
gain or lose electrons.

240
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,760
But that does not change what
element you're dealing with.

241
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,230
And likewise, when you change
the number of neutrons, that

242
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,290
also does not change the element
you're dealing with.

243
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,980
But that leads to an obvious
question of, well, how many

244
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,900
neutrons and electrons
do you have?

245
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:43,370
Well, if an atom is
charge-neutral, that means it

246
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,100
has the same number
of electrons.

247
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,173
So let's say that
I have carbon.

248
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,620
Its atomic number is six.

249
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,240
And let's say its mass
number is twelve.

250
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,450
Now what does this mean?

251
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,870
And let me say further that this
is a neutral particle.

252
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,460
This is a neutral atom.

253
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,570
So the atomic number
for carbon is six.

254
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,860
That tells us exactly how
many protons it has.

255
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,280
So if I were to draw a little
model here, and this is in no

256
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,330
way an accurate model.

257
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll draw six-- two, three,
four, five, six

258
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,380
protons in the center.

259
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,100
And the weight of these protons,
each proton is one

260
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,870
atomic mass unit, and we'll
talk more about how that

261
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,120
relates to kilograms.
It's a very small

262
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,580
fraction of a kilogram.

263
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,230
Roughly I think it's
1.6 times 10 to the

264
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,160
minus 27th of a kilogram.

265
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,080
So let's say each of these are
one atomic mass unit, and

266
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,990
that's approximately equal to,
I think, 1.67 times 10 to the

267
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,320
minus 27 kilograms. This
is a very small number.

268
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,290
It's actually almost impossible
to visualize.

269
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,750
At least it is for me.

270
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,240
This tells me the mass of the
entire carbon atom, of this

271
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,300
particular carbon atom.

272
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,790
And this can actually
change from carbon

273
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,100
atom to carbon atom.

274
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,720
And this is essentially the
mass of all of the protons

275
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,410
plus all of the neutrons.

276
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,540
And each proton has an atomic
mass of one, in atomic mass

277
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,760
units, and each neutron
has an atomic mass of

278
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,530
one atomic mass unit.

279
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:28,660
So this is really the number
of protons plus

280
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,910
the number of neutrons.

281
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,280
So in this case we have six
protons, so we must also have

282
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,110
six neutrons.

283
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,920
Six neutrons plus six protons.

284
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,490
Now, where are the electrons?

285
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,130
Well, I said it's neutral, so
the proton has an equal

286
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,360
positive charge as the
electron's negative charge.

287
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,340
So this is a neutral atom, and
it has six protons, so it also

288
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,380
has six electrons.

289
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,000
Let me draw that.

290
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,180
So we said it has six
neutrons in here.

291
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,900
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

292
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,863
So that's the nucleus
right there.

293
00:14:04,863 --> 00:14:09,300
And then if we were to draw the
electons-- well, I could

294
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,110
draw it as a smear, but if we
want to kind of visualize it a

295
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,670
little better, we could say,
OK, there's going to be six

296
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,290
electrons orbiting.

297
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,460
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

298
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,280
And they're going to be moving
around in this unpredictable

299
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,830
way that we would have
to describe with

300
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,770
a probability function.

301
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:30,170
And so the interesting thing
about it is, most of the mass

302
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,890
of an atom is sitting
right in here.

303
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,860
I mean, you might notice that
when people care about the

304
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,480
mass, when they care about the
atomic mass number of an atom,

305
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,610
they ignore the electrons.

306
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:47,660
And that's because the mass
of a proton, one proton

307
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,530
mass-wise, is equal
to 1,836 electons.

308
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:58,250
So for thinking about the mass
of an atom, for all basic

309
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,920
purposes, you can ignore the
mass of an electron.

310
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,570
It's really the mass of the
nucleus that counts as the

311
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,200
mass of the atom.

312
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,400
Now, you might see this periodic
table here, and you

313
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,680
say, OK, they gave us the
atomic number up there.

314
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,030
The atomic number of
oxygen is eight.

315
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,190
It means it has eight protons.

316
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,470
The atomic number of
silicon is 14.

317
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,660
It has 14 protons.

318
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,230
Now what is this right here?

319
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,505
Let's see, in carbon.

320
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:34,150
In carbon they have
this 12.0107.

321
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,980
That is the atomic
weight of carbon.

322
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,230
Let me write this.

323
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,390
Atomic weight of carbon.

324
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:56,730
The atomic weight of
carbon is 12.0107.

325
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,710
Now, what does that mean?

326
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:03,200
Does that mean that carbon has
six protons and then the

327
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,480
remainder, the remaining 6.0107
neutrons, it has kind

328
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,710
of this fraction of a neutron?

329
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,130
No.

330
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,790
It means if you were to average
all the different

331
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,470
versions of carbon you find on
the planet and you were to

332
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,490
average the number of neutrons
based on the quantity of the

333
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,360
different types of carbon,
this is the

334
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,730
average you would get.

335
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,980
So it turns out that carbon, the
two major forms, the main

336
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,130
one you'll find is carbon-12.

337
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,460
So that's like this.

338
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,210
So that has six protons
and six neutrons.

339
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,710
And then another isotope
of carbon.

340
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,420
Now an isotope is the same
element with a different

341
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,370
number of neutrons.

342
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,170
Another isotope of carbon is
carbon-14, which is much more

343
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,240
scarce on the planet.

344
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,920
We don't know how much in the
universe, but on the planet.

345
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,750
Now, if you were to average
these, not just a straight-up

346
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,480
average, then you would get
carbon-13 and then the atomic

347
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,130
weight would be 13, but you
weight this one much higher

348
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,160
because this exists in much
larger quantities on Earth.

349
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,589
I mean, this is pretty
much all of the

350
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,270
carbon that you see.

351
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,619
But there's a little
bit of this.

352
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,530
So if you weight them
appropriately, the average

353
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,420
becomes this.

354
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,200
So most of the carbon you'll
find-- if you just found

355
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,569
carbon someplace, on average
its weight in atomic mass

356
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:27,040
units is going to be 12.0107.

357
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,190
But that idea of an isotope
is an interesting one.

358
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,180
Remember, when you change the
neutrons, you're not changing

359
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,820
the actual, fundamental
element.

360
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,210
You're just getting a different
isotope, a different

361
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,590
version, of the element.

362
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,500
So these two versions of carbon
are both isotopes.

363
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Now, I want to leave this video
with what I think is

364
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,850
kind of the neatest idea behind
atoms. And it's the

365
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,780
most philosophically interesting
things about them.

366
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,190
It's that the relative size--
so, we have these electrons,

367
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,340
which represent very little
of the mass of an atom.

368
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,470
It's 1/2000 of the mass of an
atom are the electrons.

369
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,560
And even those, it's hard
to even describe them as

370
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,790
particles, because you can't
even tell me exactly where and

371
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,170
how fast one of these
particles is moving.

372
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,880
They just have a probability
function.

373
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,280
So most of the atom is sitting
inside the nucleus.

374
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,880
And this is the interesting
thing.

375
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,080
If you look at an atom
on average, if you

376
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,040
say this is my atom.

377
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,300
Let's say I had two atoms that
are bonded to each other.

378
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,065
And I were to say, how much
of this is actual stuff?

379
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:32,120
And when I say stuff, that's a
very abstract concept, because

380
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,670
we're talking about the
nucleus, right?

381
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,740
Because the nucleus
is where all the

382
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,470
mass is, all the stuff.

383
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,750
It turns out that it's actually
an infinitesimally

384
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,160
small fraction of the volume of
the atom where-- the volume

385
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,920
of the atom is hard to define,
because the electron can

386
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,870
pretty much be anywhere, but
if you view the volume as

387
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,580
where you're most likely to find
the electron, or with 90%

388
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,710
probability you're likely to
find the electron, then the

389
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,150
nucleus is, in a lot of cases
and the way I think about it,

390
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,740
it's about 1/10,000
of the volume.

391
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,590
So if you think about it, when
you look at something, if you

392
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,460
look at your hand or if you
look at the wall or if you

393
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:14,830
look at your computer, 99.99%
of it is free space.

394
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,470
It's nothing.

395
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,320
It's vacuum.

396
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,600
If you had ultra-small-- I
guess we could call them

397
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,020
particles or something-- most
of them would pass straight

398
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,690
through whatever you look at.

399
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,530
So it already starts to kind of

400
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,210
question our hold on reality.

401
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,120
What is there when, if-- and
this is fact, this isn't

402
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,350
theory right here-- that if you
take anything down to the

403
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,580
building blocks, down to the
atomic level, most of the

404
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,450
space of that kind of,
quote-unquote object, is free

405
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,470
vacuum space.

406
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,490
You could go straight through
it if you could get down to

407
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,940
that scale.

408
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,880
This image of a helium atom,
they say right here this is

409
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,520
one femtometer.

410
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:52,810
Right?

411
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,060
One femtometer.

412
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,180
This is the scale of
the nucleus of a

413
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,780
helium atom, right?

414
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,090
One femtometer.

415
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,310
This is one angstrom, right?

416
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,820
And they say that equals
100,000 femtometers.

417
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,360
And just to get a sense of
scale, one angstrom is 1 times

418
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,420
10 to the negative
10 meters, right?

419
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,830
So the atom is roughly on the
scale of an angstrom.

420
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,780
In the case of helium,
the nucleus is

421
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,990
even a smaller fraction.

422
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,930
It's 1/100,000.

423
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,700
So if you had-- let's say you
had liquid helium, which you'd

424
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,190
have to get very cold to get.

425
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,610
If you're looking at that,
most of it is free space.

426
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,550
If you're looking at an iron
bar, the great, great, great,

427
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,310
great, great, great majority
of it is free space.

428
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,500
And we're not even talking
about, maybe there's some free

429
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,240
space inside the nucleus
that we could talk

430
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,210
about in the future.

431
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,950
But to me, that just blows my
mind that most things we look

432
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,870
at are not really solid.

433
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,530
They're really just empty space,
but they look solid

434
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,360
because of the way light
reflects on them or the forces

435
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,130
that repel us.

436
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,100
But there really isn't something
to touch there.

437
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,800
That most of this right here
is all free space.

438
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,260
I think I've said the word free
space now, and I think

439
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,370
I'll leave further

440
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,020
mind-blowing to the next video.
