1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
   

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,840
I will now do a presentation
on the center of mass.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,110
And the center mass, hopefully,
is something that

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,130
will be a little bit intuitive
to you, and it actually has

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,300
some very neat applications.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,530
So in very simple terms, the
center of mass is a point.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,850
Let me draw an object.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,520
Let's say that this
is my object.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,770
Let's say it's a ruler.

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,800
   

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,270
This ruler, it exists,
so it has some mass.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,310
And my question to you is
what is the center mass?

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,240
And you say, Sal, well, in order
to know figure out the

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,910
center mass, you have to tell me
what the center of mass is.

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,340
And what I tell you is the
center mass is a point, and it

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,750
actually doesn't have to even
be a point in the object.

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,850
I'll do an example soon
where it won't be.

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,820
But it's a point.

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,705
And at that point, for dealing
with this object as a whole or

20
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:57,040
the mass of the object as a
whole, we can pretend that the

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,550
entire mass exists
at that point.

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,420
And what do I mean
by saying that?

23
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,540
Well, let's say that the
center of mass is here.

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,890
And I'll tell you why
I picked this point.

25
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,200
Because that is pretty close
to where the center

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,970
of mass will be.

27
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,980
If the center of mass is there,
and let's say the mass

28
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,110
of this entire ruler is, I don't
know, 10 kilograms. This

29
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:25,820
ruler, if a force is applied at
the center of mass, let's

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,950
say 10 Newtons, so the mass
of the whole ruler is 10

31
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:37,430
kilograms. If a force is applied
at the center of mass,

32
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,250
this ruler will accelerate the
same exact way as would a

33
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,950
point mass.

34
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,180
Let's say that we just had a
little dot, but that little

35
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,870
dot had the same mass, 10
kilograms, and we were to push

36
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,500
on that dot with 10 Newtons.

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,960
In either case, in the case of
the ruler, we would accelerate

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,860
upwards at what?

39
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,460
Force divided by mass, so we
would accelerate upwards at 1

40
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,580
meter per second squared.

41
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,580
And in this case of this
point mass, we would

42
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,009
accelerate that point.

43
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,665
When I say point mass, I'm just
saying something really,

44
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:13,500
really small, but it has a mass
of 10 kilograms, so it's

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,470
much smaller, but it has the
same mass as this ruler.

46
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,270
This would also accelerate
upwards with a magnitude of 1

47
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,870
meters per second squared.

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,550
   

49
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,660
So why is this useful to us?

50
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,850
Well, sometimes we have some
really crazy objects and we

51
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,550
want to figure out exactly
what it does.

52
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,370
If we know its center of mass
first, we can know how that

53
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,440
object will behave without
having to worry about the

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,850
shape of that object.

55
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,730
And I'll give you a really easy
way of realizing where

56
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,270
the center of mass is.

57
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,710
If the object has a uniform
distribution-- when I say

58
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,160
that, it means, for simple
purposes, if it's made out of

59
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,710
the same thing and that thing
that it's made out of, its

60
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,970
density, doesn't really change
throughout the object, the

61
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,490
center of mass will be the
object's geometric center.

62
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,700
So in this case, this
ruler's almost a

63
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,660
one-dimensional object.

64
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,840
We just went halfway.

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,670
The distance from here to here
and the distance from here to

66
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,230
here are the same.

67
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,240
This is the center of mass.

68
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,900
If we had a two-dimensional
object, let's say we had this

69
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,080
triangle and we want to figure
out its center of mass, it'll

70
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,070
be the center in
two dimensions.

71
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,370
So it'll be something
like that.

72
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,730
Now, if I had another situation,
let's say I have

73
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,340
this square.

74
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,800
I don't know if that's big
enough for you to see.

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,550
I need to draw it a
little thicker.

76
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,890
Let's say I have this square,
but let's say that half of

77
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:49,945
this square is made from lead.

78
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:55,780
   

79
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,630
And let's say the other half
of the square is made from

80
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,120
something lighter than lead.

81
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,920
It's made of styrofoam.

82
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,450
That is lighter than lead.

83
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,680
So in this situation, the center
of mass isn't going to

84
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,770
be the geographic center.

85
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,080
I don't know how much denser
lead is than styrofoam, but

86
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,360
the center of mass is going to
be someplace closer to the

87
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,930
right because this object does
not have a uniform density.

88
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,065
It'll actually depend on how
much denser the lead is than

89
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,730
the styrofoam, which
I don't know.

90
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,100
But hopefully, that gives you a
little intuition of what the

91
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,100
center of mass is.

92
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,130
And now I'll tell you something
a little more

93
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,650
interesting.

94
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,530
Every problem we have done so
far, we actually made the

95
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,360
simplifying assumption that
the force acts on

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,930
the center of mass.

97
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,510
So if I have an object, let's
say the object that

98
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,760
looks like a horse.

99
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,620
   

100
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,590
Let's say that object.

101
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,210
If this is the object's center
of mass, I don't know where

102
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,100
the horse's center of mass
normally is, but let's say a

103
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,810
horse's center of
mass is here.

104
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:10,990
If I apply a force directly on
that center of mass, then the

105
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,310
object will move in the
direction of that force with

106
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,660
the appropriate acceleration.

107
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,390
We could divide the force by the
mass of the entire horse

108
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:19,990
and we would figure out the

109
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,080
acceleration in that direction.

110
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,480
But now I will throw in a twist.
And actually, every

111
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,200
problem we did, all of these
Newton's Law's problems, we

112
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,140
assumed that the force acted
at the center of mass.

113
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,820
But something more interesting
happens if the force acts away

114
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,070
from the center of mass.

115
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,350
   

116
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,190
Let me actually take
that ruler example.

117
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,210
I don't know why I even
drew the horse.

118
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:52,570
If I have this ruler again and
this is the center of mass, as

119
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,120
we said, any force that we act
on the center of mass, the

120
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,040
whole object will move in the
direction of the force.

121
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,800
It'll be shifted by the
force, essentially.

122
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,810
Now, this is what's
interesting.

123
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,900
If that's the center of mass and
if I were to apply a force

124
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,736
someplace else away from the
center of mass, let' say I

125
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:15,880
apply a force here, I want you
to think about for a second

126
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,750
what will probably happen
to the object.

127
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,220
Well, it turns out that the
object will rotate.

128
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,240
And so think about if we're on
the space shuttle or we're in

129
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,540
deep space or something, and
if I have a ruler, and if I

130
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,980
just push at one end of the
ruler, what's going to happen?

131
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,240
Am I just going to push the
whole ruler or is the whole

132
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,300
ruler is going to rotate?

133
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,430
And hopefully, your intuition
is correct.

134
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,770
The whole ruler will rotate
around the center of mass.

135
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:42,010
And in general, if you were to
throw a monkey wrench at

136
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,680
someone, and I don't recommend
that you do, but if you did,

137
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,890
and while the monkey wrench is
spinning in the air, it's

138
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,480
spinning around its
center of mass.

139
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,940
Same for a knife.

140
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,900
If you're a knife catcher,
that's something you should

141
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,280
think about, that the object,
when it's free, when it's not

142
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,580
fixed to any point, it rotates
around its center of mass, and

143
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,570
that's very interesting.

144
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,650
So you can actually throw random
objects, and that point

145
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,330
at which it rotates
around, that's the

146
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,340
object's center of mass.

147
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,630
That's an experiment that you
should do in an open field

148
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,690
around no one else.

149
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,970
Now, with all of this, and
I'll actually in the next

150
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,290
video tell you what this is.

151
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,130
When you have a force that
causes rotational motion as

152
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,970
opposed to a shifting motion,
that's torque, but we'll do

153
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,850
that in the next video.

154
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,610
But now I'll show you just a
cool example of how the center

155
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,880
of mass is relevant in everyday
applications, like

156
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,890
high jumping.

157
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,340
So in general, let's say
that this is a bar.

158
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,690
This is a side view of a
bar, and this is the

159
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,530
thing holding the bar.

160
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,440
And a guy wants to jump
over the bar.

161
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,810
   

162
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,880
His center of mass is-- most
people's center of mass is

163
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,170
around their gut.

164
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,380
I think evolutionarily that's
why our gut is there, because

165
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,870
it's close to our
center of mass.

166
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,460
So there's two ways to jump.

167
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,500
You could just jump straight
over the bar, like a hurdle

168
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,130
jump, in which case your center
of mass would have to

169
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,500
cross over the bar.

170
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,510
And we could figure out this
mass, and we can figure out

171
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,657
how much energy and how much
force is required to propel a

172
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:16,630
mass that high because we know
projectile motion and we know

173
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,270
all of Newton's laws.

174
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,410
But what you see a lot in the
Olympics is people doing a

175
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,810
very strange type of jump,
where, when they're going over

176
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,430
the bar, they look something
like this.

177
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,700
Their backs are arched
over the bar.

178
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,600
   

179
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
Not a good picture.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,520
But what happens when someone
arches their back over

181
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,340
the bar like this?

182
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,370
I hope you get the point.

183
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,440
This is the bar right here.

184
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,350
Well, it's interesting.

185
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,390
If you took the average of
this person's density and

186
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,940
figured out his geometric center
and all of that, the

187
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,500
center of mass in this
situation, if someone jumps

188
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,940
like that, actually travels
below the bar.

189
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,750
Because the person arches their
back so much, if you

190
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,590
took the average of the total
mass of where the person is,

191
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,770
their center of mass actually
goes below the bar.

192
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,320
And because of that, you can
clear a bar without having

193
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,820
your center of mass go as high
as the bar and so you need

194
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,960
less force to do it.

195
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,370
Or another way to say it, with
the same force, you could

196
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,723
clear a higher bar.

197
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:15,530
,

198
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,720
Hopefully, I didn't confuse you,
but that's exactly why

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,037
these high jumpers arch their
back, so that their center of

200
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:26,910
mass is actually below the bar
and they don't have to exert

201
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,810
as much force.

202
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,430
Anyway, hopefully you found that
to be a vaguely useful

203
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,610
introduction to the center of
mass, and I'll see you in the

204
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,100
next video on torque.

205
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,200
