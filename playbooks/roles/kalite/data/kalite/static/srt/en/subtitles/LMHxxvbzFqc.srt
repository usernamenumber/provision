1
00:00:00,475 --> 00:00:03,288
I'm here with Professor Lawrence Baker at Stanford Medical School

2
00:00:03,288 --> 00:00:07,889
and what we're going to talk about now is the overview of the healthcare system-

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:09,295
-What is the healthcare system?

4
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:10,444
Yeah, and who's in it?

5
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:11,765
-And who's in it, and what are they doing?

6
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:16,416
I think I can give a go at it. And then correct me, expose my ignorance.

7
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:24,514
So clearly, you have your providers, those would be your doctors and nurses and all the rest.

8
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:26,715
-Hospitals, and pharmacies, all kinds of people . . .

9
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:30,832
Okay, so, everyone who is providing healthcare. So that's right over there.

10
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:33,494
So that's hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, all the rest.

11
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:36,780
And then, they are providing healthcare to someone.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,163
So those would be the patients. We did that in another color.

13
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:43,431
Call 'em patients yes, sometimes you get details like

14
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:45,458
people become patients after they need healthcare.

15
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,549
But some people just have a question, they aren't really patients.

16
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:48,322
They're just asking.

17
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:49,376
Okay well, what do you call them then?

18
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:50,460
Call them the "population."

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,514
Population?

20
00:00:51,514 --> 00:00:54,912
So just the population of the world, or the country or whatever? People.

21
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:58,667
And then, on the other hand now, someone has to pay for this.

22
00:00:58,667 --> 00:00:59,931
Someone has to pay for this.

23
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:01,882
And so for the most part, this is insurers.

24
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:05,568
Yep, insurance companies. In the old days - like if you go back a hundred years -

25
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:08,665
we didn't really have insurance. We had patients and providers,

26
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:11,331
and patients would, if they had a question, they had a concern,

27
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:13,636
they would go to the provider, they'd make some deal, pay him some money,

28
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,751
do some service for them, and work it out.

29
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:19,115
We got insurance companies really only in the last hundred years,

30
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:22,408
maybe really starting in the US in maybe 1930, 1940

31
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:24,710
they started to become popular. So that's kind of a new renovation.

32
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,826
And those three things work together.

33
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:28,499
And the general term - and this is a word I've seen a lot -

34
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:30,883
it's sometimes a little confusing, because it's very close to "payER,"

35
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,265
You hear, it's kind of like, "payORS."

36
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:39,683
That would be including, that's anyone who's paying for the service.

37
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,690
Yes.

38
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,714
And insurance companies would be included there.

39
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:46,898
Right. So we have - we call them payors, sometimes we call them health plans,

40
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,134
because they arrange for some of the care that people get.

41
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:53,583
You know, payors could be private companies, private insurance companies,

42
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,295
or they could be government payors,

43
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:56,943
government insurance companies like Medicare.

44
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:58,904
And the insurance companies themselves, they're not doing this,

45
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:00,364
you know, just out of the goodness of their hearts.

46
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:01,401
Someone is paying them.

47
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:02,097
Right.

48
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:04,416
And for the most part, in the United States, it tends to be employers.

49
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,892
Right. So we've made another arrow on your diagram here.

50
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:12,141
That would be from the population, or maybe from the patients,

51
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:15,466
to the insurance companies, that provides the money

52
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,984
for the insurance companies to use to pay for the providers.

53
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,499
So patients might buy an insurance company, or buy an insurance company...

54
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:23,028
Buy an insurance policy! [chuckling]

55
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:28,294
Patients might buy their own policy, go buy an insurance policy,

56
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:30,845
pay them a premium directly, the insurance company collects that money.

57
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:34,011
Or, for most people, they work for an employer.

58
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:35,999
The employer makes the arrangement to buy that insurance,

59
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:40,165
and then implicitly charges the population, the patients, for that,

60
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:42,716
maybe directly by having them contribute some of their salary;

61
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:46,387
maybe implicitly, by just reducing the amount of cash they give them every month

62
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:48,652
and instead giving them this insurance policy.

63
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:49,417
I see.

64
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,589
So, people do that. And the other piece that's floating around in here

65
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,863
is that in some cases, the population pays taxes to the government -

66
00:02:54,863 --> 00:02:55,899
Oh right, right.

67
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:59,666
- that then functions essentially as an insurer like the Medicare program,

68
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,663
where there's insurance provided to people, it's paid for by taxes.

69
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:06,278
So there's different funds flows going around here, but always money going

70
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:10,298
from patients to insurers, through employers, through taxes, by direct payments.

71
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:14,148
Those insurers collecting the money, and then paying for a bunch of the care

72
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:17,537
that's provided by the providers. That's the basic arrangement.

73
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:18,861
There's one more tiny piece, which is,

74
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:21,290
at some times, the patients pay the doctors or the hospitals directly.

75
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,215
You know, you go, you have a $20 copayment.

76
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:26,336
And so there's a small payment that goes back and forth.

77
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,029
Right. Your copay is kind of there, just so that,

78
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:31,618
it kind of makes insurance company feel good that you're not just using it willy-nilly.

79
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:34,267
That you have to pay your, you know, whatever, ten dollars, or fifty dollars.

80
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:38,268
Absolutely. So, insurers know that once they start paying the providers for the care

81
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,900
and the patient has it totally free, people might use stuff that,

82
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,766
you know, might be worth a little tiny bit,

83
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:44,567
but it costs a lot for everybody to pay for.

84
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,859
So if you put a copayment on there, it makes people think twice

85
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,363
about using things that they don't really need.

86
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:49,617
Right, that makes complete sense.

87
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:52,802
And then within this ecosystem we hear a lot about HMOs,

88
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:56,484
that - in my perception - is a combination of the insurance company

89
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:59,195
and the provider. It's kind of in one package.

90
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:03,199
Right. So, over time, the US has had different kinds of insurers out there.

91
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,028
In the private market especially, there's been a lot

92
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:08,534
of innovation in the last 30, 40 years, in types of insurers that are out there.

93
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:12,861
So we have different insurers that have behaved in different ways

94
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,933
as we've gone through those evolutionary cycles.

95
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,550
So one version of that is what we call an HMO,

96
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,066
a Health Maintenance Organization, and that's really just jargon;

97
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:23,130
you have to dig into it to figure out what it means.

98
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,208
But in a lot of cases what that is is a company that's acting as insurance;

99
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,912
so you pay a premium to them if you're a patient, or a person . . .

100
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:34,144
and you buy some coverage, and then they'll cover your care;

101
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:37,036
but they'll do that by trying to integrate themselves with the providers.

102
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:39,364
And so, the organizations either are integrated

103
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,577
because the HMO hires doctors directly,

104
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:45,027
or maybe owns the hospitals, like Kaiser Permanente, for example;

105
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:49,464
or on some cases, it's a contractual relationship. It's not exactly the same . . .

106
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:51,652
Oh right. So not all of it is tightly linked to, like a Kaiser,

107
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:54,301
where it's like you go to this building that says "Kaiser" on it,

108
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:55,562
and that's where your doctor is.

109
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,245
It could be doctors just have their practices,

110
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:01,901
but they're tightly linked with a - I think I saw what, Blue Shield? or one of those.

111
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,002
Yeah, Blue Shield, or Aetna, or Cigna, some of these different companies.

112
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:09,410
And you can start to dig into the details, and every one will be a little bit different from the other.

113
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,449
But they're contractual relationships.

114
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,133
And the difference - and I think this is something everyone faces

115
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,262
when they, you know, sign up with insurance with their employer -

116
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:17,184
I had to do it recently - is, you know, they always say,

117
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:21,246
you have to pick HMO versus PPO, and they're within the same policy;

118
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:27,653
and so my perception is, HMO is - they - you have a set list of doctors,

119
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:30,565
that they probably pre-negotiated pricing with.

120
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:36,071
Yeah. So, the difference between HMOs and PPOs gets a little bit into the . . .

121
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:38,567
OK, I don't want to get too far into the weeds . . .

122
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:39,995
. . . But, we can sort of think about it

123
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:40,847
in the way that you're talking about it.

124
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:44,182
So, an HMO will have a list of doctors that you're supposed to see,

125
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:46,261
and you'll have to go see doctors on that list.

126
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:49,350
In a stereotypical one, if you don't see the doctors on that list,

127
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,551
the insurance company's not gonna pay for your care.

128
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:54,886
You're gonna pay yourself. And in a stereotypical HMO,

129
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,684
there's gonna be a fairly tight management

130
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:59,231
between the insurance company and the doctors about what's gonna be done,

131
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:00,545
what's allowable, and so on.

132
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:02,797
And in the most tightly linked case, they'll be like, the same . . .

133
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:05,249
the doctor will be employed by the company.

134
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:06,001
Right, that's like -

135
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,744
-Right, Kaiser. As you kind of think about it as a spectrum.

136
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:09,969
If you move a little bit away from that to a PPO,

137
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,073
what's happening in PPOs is you're still gonna get a list;

138
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:14,217
so you're gonna be encouraged to see those doctors,

139
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:15,932
but maybe there'll be a little more flexibility.

140
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:17,714
Like, if you decided not to see someone on the list,

141
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:20,050
the plan would still pay some amount,

142
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,545
maybe not as much as they would if you saw someone on the list,

143
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:24,735
but something; whereas in an HMO, maybe nothing.

144
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:27,146
And the plan will probably work a little less hard

145
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:29,398
at managing what those doctors are doing,

146
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:31,968
to try and limit access to, say, high-cost services.

147
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:35,013
HMO will tend to work harder, PPO tends to work a little less hard.

148
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:36,132
So, it's a little bit of a spectrum.

149
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:41,352
You're kind of moving from more managed and more concentrated to a little less managed.

150
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:45,416
But still more so than the system we had, say, in the 50s or 60s,

151
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,750
where anybody went to any doctor and any doctor did whatever they wanted,

152
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,710
and the insurance company just paid the bill;

153
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,870
and there was no integration. So, it's a little bit of a . . .

154
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,431
So that's the main motivation why insurance companies are trying to get

155
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:58,314
kind of more integrated with the providers,

156
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:00,529
is because just like you said, in the 50s and 60s,

157
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:03,127
you have the provider providing a service,

158
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:05,295
and obviously the patient would like the service,

159
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:06,899
and then you have a third party paying for it.

160
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,918
And so there's no check on, you know,

161
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:10,950
the person deciding on the service and the person getting it says,

162
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,301
"Yeah! Let's get more service!" And someone else is . . . Right.

163
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:15,915
That's just, we've created a big issue.

164
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,619
Insurance companies are kind of an interesting thing in the health policy world.

165
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:19,949
Because we have to have them.

166
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,718
We have to have them to manage the risk associated with getting sick.

167
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,152
You can get sick today and get a huge bill.

168
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,268
And so, we can't leave people on their own for that;

169
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:27,684
we gotta have insurance companies.

170
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:29,231
But as soon as you create insurance companies,

171
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:32,619
and I can have implicitly all my neighbors pay for the health care that I want,

172
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,013
then I might start using things that turn out to be inefficient;

173
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:38,935
and so, you gotta have them, insurance companies,

174
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:42,038
but you gotta manage what happens when you have them also;

175
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:43,636
and so that's the integration between providers,

176
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:46,217
or copayments and utilization review;

177
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,752
and all these things are basically attempts by insurance companies

178
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:52,079
to try and manage what economists would call the "moral hazard,"

179
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,224
using additional services that you don't necessarily need,

180
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,149
because everybody else is gonna pay for it for you.
