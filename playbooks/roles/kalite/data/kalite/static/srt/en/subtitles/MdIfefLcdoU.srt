1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,930
So the example of the bank we've
been studying, we're

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,500
actually kind of doing
it in real time.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,510
And I was doing this
on the fly.

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,530
We actually showed
how this bank got

6
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,320
quote-unquote bailed out.

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,390
And it got bailed out by the
sovereign wealth fund.

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,160
Because when this last piece of
debt came due, it couldn't

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,850
sell its CDOs for enough money
to pay off that debt.

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,880
So they just kind of held fast
and didn't sell their CDOs.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,700
They couldn't get any other
loans to pay off this loan.

12
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,880
But what they were able to do is
to convince some foreigners

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,290
who were enamored by the brand
of this institution of

14
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,690
American capitalism.

15
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,560
So they were willing to buy some
shares in this company

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,700
and essentially bail it out.

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,770
So in the example, we used to
have 500 million shares.

18
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,390
The company issued another
2 billion shares.

19
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,730
Sold them at $1.50 per share.

20
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,830
And they got $3 billion
for it.

21
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,400
And so then you had $3
billion in cash.

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,640
We had $1 billion before, so
now we had $4 billion.

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,615
We could pay off the loan with
$3 billion of the cash and

24
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:56,040
then we're left with
$1 billion.

25
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,380
And now this company would have,
if you have $1 billion

26
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,370
in cash and $4 billion of CDOs,
it would think that it

27
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,090
has $5 billion of assets.

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,990
If these are really
worth $4 billion.

29
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,860
It has no liabilities, so it
has $5 billion of equity.

30
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,320
Notice the equity
doesn't change.

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,980
When you take some of your
assets and you get the value

32
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,680
of the assets that you think
they're worth and you pay off

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,820
some liabilities, it
doesn't change the

34
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,050
value of your equity.

35
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,520
But what's happened now?

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,740
This is just to get comfortable
with some of this

37
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,590
terminology.

38
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,800
This company now is completely
delevered.

39
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,720
Because it has no liabilities,
it has no debt, and its assets

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,190
are equal to its equity.

41
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,970
And you'll find that lot of
companies that are startups

42
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,030
and technology companies,
a lot of those

43
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,020
have very little debt.

44
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,160
And so they're completely
delevered.

45
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,360
Anyway, that was
just an aside.

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,330
But this was an example
of how a company

47
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,850
could get bailed out.

48
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,120
And who lost here?

49
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,240
Well the shareholders lost.
Because before, there was only

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,860
500 million shares that
split up the equity.

51
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,330
And now there's 2.5 billion
shares to split this equity.

52
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,650
So the book value of the shares,
if you eve believe

53
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,870
that these are really worth
$4 billion, they

54
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,150
went from $4 to $2.

55
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,200
And I think this is an
important aside here.

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,830
Because I've mentioned before
that the market price when you

57
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,590
buy or sell a share, it's just
transacting between another

58
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,070
person who used to be
holding that share.

59
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,910
So how does it affect
the company?

60
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,220
Well it affects the company
when the company needs to

61
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,580
raise more money.

62
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,530
And that's what happened
in this example.

63
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,470
The company had to
raise more money.

64
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,800
It had to go to, maybe it was
the government of Singapore's

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,790
sovereign wealth fund.

66
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,810
And they say, government of
Singapore, please invest in

67
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,590
us, buy some of our shares.

68
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,600
And when the government of
Singapore, or any investor,

69
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,570
wants to buy new shares, they
use the market value, what

70
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,160
that stock is trading at, as a
good reference point for what

71
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,040
you might have to pay
for those shares.

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,820
Oftentimes if it's kind of a
desperate situation and this

73
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,260
person is kind of saving
you, they'll pay

74
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,180
below the market price.

75
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,280
But sometimes, if they say,
oh, this is a lucky

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,160
opportunity to get such a large
number of shares and

77
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,850
essentially take control of
the company, I might be a

78
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,250
little premium over it.

79
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,780
So I'll pay $2 per share,
which is a little bit of

80
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,350
premium over the market value
at the time, which was $1.

81
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,980
But anyway, that's why the
market price of something in

82
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,890
the secondary markets, where a
share is just trading between

83
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,350
people who aren't
related to the

84
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,870
company, why that's important.

85
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,280
Because when the company needs
to raise money, that is used

86
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,790
as kind of the fair market value
of a company's shares.

87
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,390
But anyway, this was the
situation where the company

88
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,510
gets bailed out.

89
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,430
But what happens in a situation
where it doesn't get

90
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,350
bailed out?

91
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,900
Let's do that.

92
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,336
Let's say that the sovereign
wealth fund never happened.

93
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:41,590
Let me clear this.

94
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,910
   

95
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:52,645
So the assets, we had
$1 billion in cash.

96
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:55,880
   

97
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,870
And we have these $4
billion of CDOs.

98
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,650
   

99
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,795
For a total of $5 billion.

100
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:10,320
The liabilities, we
had Loan C, it's

101
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,150
coming due for $3 billion.

102
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,790
And then you had the equity,
which is essentially the total

103
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,860
assets minus the liability.

104
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,220
So that's $2 billion.

105
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:31,740
And that's split amongst
500 million shares.

106
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,100
And that tells you that the book
value per share is $4.

107
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,560
   

108
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,490
We're not going to worry right
now what the market value of

109
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,410
the shares are.

110
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,830
So let's say they shop
everything around.

111
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,940
All of these sovereign wealth
funds, they've got burned,

112
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,500
because they invested in
Citibank last year and the

113
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,675
stock just continued
to plummet.

114
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:53,820
They invested in Merrill Lynch,
all of these they

115
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,460
invested in and it just
continued to plummet.

116
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,540
So they've been burned.

117
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,870
They don't want to be the last
guy holding the potato.

118
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,940
So there's no-one who's willing
to invest equity.

119
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,130
So it just forces the issue.

120
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,670
These people, Loan C, they say,
we're not going to give

121
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,120
you a new loan, you can't pay
this loan, because even if you

122
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,690
sold these CDOs, you're only
getting a $1 for them.

123
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,710
So we are going to force
you into bankruptcy.

124
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,530
And that's how bankruptcy
happens.

125
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,940
When you break one of the-- they
call it the covenants--

126
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,990
with one of the people
who lent you money.

127
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,410
The covenants say, if you don't
pay a loan within this

128
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,700
amount of time or some other
thing happens to your

129
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,990
financials, you are then
declared insolvent and you go

130
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,330
into bankruptcy.

131
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,330
And what happens
in bankruptcy?

132
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,770
Well, in bankruptcy, the
bankruptcy courts takes

133
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,485
receivership of all
of your assets.

134
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:47,470
   

135
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,400
They just say, OK this
is what you own.

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,740
And we're not going to go
into the details now.

137
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,530
Maybe I'll do a whole series
of videos on the details of

138
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,240
bankruptcy.

139
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,100
You might get some type of
loan that helps you just

140
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,220
continue to do business.

141
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,430
Because people have to figure
out, are they just going to

142
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,420
restructure your liabilities?

143
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,570
Or are they just going
to dissolve you?

144
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,220
Because you're not a viable
entity anymore.

145
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,860
But anyway, the bankruptcy court
will take hold of you.

146
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,820
And let's assume that they're
going to dissolve you.

147
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,700
They will then split you amongst
the stakeholders, the

148
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,030
people who you owe money to.

149
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,560
Actually, let's not say that
they dissolve you.

150
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,420
Let's say that everyone
agrees that this

151
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,900
brand is worth a lot.

152
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,180
Whatever we call it, Goldman
Lynch or Lehman Sachs.

153
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,870
Whatever our brand is,
it's worth a lot.

154
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,940
No-one wants to see
it disappear.

155
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,330
So what happens when you
go into bankruptcy?

156
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,090
Well, the creditors get first
dibs on everything.

157
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,010
So one way to think of
it is Loan C gets

158
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,690
first dibs on the assets.

159
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,580
And then anything that's
left over goes

160
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,610
to the equity holders.

161
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,440
So let's say the Loan C guys,
they say we want to keep this

162
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,240
bank as an ongoing entity.

163
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,430
But what we want to do is we
just want to dump these CDOs.

164
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,320
So the bankruptcy court, OK
we'll liquidate these CDOs

165
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,390
just because everyone agrees
that they're really shady.

166
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,910
So they sell them and they only
get $1 billion for them.

167
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,410
   

168
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,826
So now we have $2 billion
of assets.

169
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:16,700
It's essentially $2
billion in cash.

170
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,090
   

171
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,060
That's all that there is.

172
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,640
Plus there's probably some
buildings in all that.

173
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,550
Which we're not listing here.

174
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,040
But there's the brand
and all that.

175
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,050
So this guy is owed
$3 billion.

176
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,970
So he says, OK fine, you know
what I'm going to do?

177
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,410
I'm going to keep this
company running.

178
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,110
I'm owed $2 billion.

179
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,310
I'm going to keep that
$2 billion in there.

180
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,560
But what I get is essentially
all of the new

181
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,750
shares of the company.

182
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,760
So what essentially the
bankruptcy court is going to

183
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,820
do, they're going to create
a new corporate entity.

184
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,900
They're going to put all of
these assets into it.

185
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,610
And then issue another
100 million shares.

186
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,910
So they essentially create a
new entity, where the new

187
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:04,640
entity has $2 billion of assets,
$2 billion of cash.

188
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,900
And let's say it has no debt.

189
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,410
Or actually maybe these people,
they say we'll even

190
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,700
give you some money-- no, I
don't want to confuse things.

191
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,370
So let's say that you
have no debt.

192
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,750
So you have $2 billion
of equity.

193
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,600
   

194
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,740
And let's say that there
are 100 million shares.

195
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,080
So the book value of the new
shares is $20 per share.

196
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,919
And you might say,
wow that's great.

197
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,700
Someone could have gotten these
shares for whatever I

198
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,970
said they were trading
for before.

199
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,680
They could've gotten them for $1
per share before, now they

200
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,039
are worth $20 per share.

201
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,580
But no, that's not the case.

202
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,850
It's actually horrible.

203
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,920
These shares, the shares
of the old

204
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,620
company are worth zero.

205
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,940
Because when you liquidated the
company, or at least when

206
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,250
you tried to value
the company, we

207
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:55,930
didn't liquidate it.

208
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,225
Because we're saying we still
want the company to continue

209
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:00,420
its operations.

210
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,470
But we're saying that the value
of the company is only

211
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,440
$2 billion.

212
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,970
This guy is owed $3 billion.

213
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,580
So he says, you know what?

214
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,990
I should get the
whole company.

215
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,960
And I'm still getting not
everything that I deserve.

216
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,480
But I'm going to get
the whole company.

217
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,020
So essentially, whoever lent
Loan C, all of these shares

218
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,640
are now their shares.

219
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,940
And the equity holders
get wiped out,

220
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,020
the old equity holders.

221
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,120
So those shares go to zero.

222
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,580
So this is an interesting
example, because I've seen

223
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,730
people on CNBC say, oh what a
great deal, I could buy shares

224
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,780
of Lehman Brothers for $1.

225
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,010
But that's not the case.

226
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,870
They'll say Lehman Brothers has
all of these assets and

227
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,420
it's never going to completely
disappear.

228
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,260
That might be true
to some degree.

229
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,710
But Lehman Brothers' assets
might be greater than its

230
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,970
liabilities, which means
that its equity is

231
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,200
actually worth negative.

232
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,110
So that $1 isn't a great deal.

233
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,210
If you really thought that
Lehman Brothers in the long

234
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,510
term was going to come back,
what you might want to do is

235
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,640
somehow try to become one
of its bondholders.

236
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,330
And then when it goes through
bankruptcy, on the other side

237
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,100
of the bankruptcy you might end
up in shares of the new

238
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,820
bank, whatever it's called.

239
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,810
Goldman Brothers or whatever.

240
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,510
Anyway, I realize
I'm out of time.

241
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,220
In the next video I'm going to
put it all together and show

242
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,940
you, one, why our financial
system is freezing.

243
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,670
And, two, what the government's
bailout is

244
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,860
attempting to do.

245
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,700
See you in the next video.
