1
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:08,223
We're in the Louvre and we're looking at a painting by Raphael called

2
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:13,998
La Belle Jardiniere, and its a lovely Raphael Madonna, and child

3
00:00:13,998 --> 00:00:16,814
with the infant Saint John the Baptist in that pyramid

4
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:20,713
composition that we often associate with the high Renascence

5
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:24,980
What's interesting is the virgin Mary is not in a religious enviroment

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,818
we see no archway, and she's got no throne

7
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:30,823
if we argue if she had a throne at all it would be

8
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:33,579
the throne of nature. She sits on a rock in a field with

9
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:36,397
a beautiful atmoshphere and persecptive behind her creating this

10
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:39,213
lovely verdant enviroment. As we look down

11
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:43,314
at the foreground we see plants and perhaps the edge of

12
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:47,414
a pond, and little flowers, the loveliest passages to me are

13
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,510
the way that Christ on the left, stands on his mother's

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,797
foot, really showing that kind of dependence on his mother

15
00:00:54,797 --> 00:01:00,281
and yet also a growing sense of independence as he seeks to take the book

16
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:03,003
out of her hands, and looks up at her.

17
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:07,898
And of course, the content of that the book foretells his own demise

18
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:15,148
and it foretells the crucifiction. And the look on Mary's face is one that suggests

19
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:20,282
that she knows this, she's looking at him in a sense gaged wheter or not

20
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:25,113
he's ready for that knowledge. She puts her right arm around him protecting him

21
00:01:25,113 --> 00:01:30,017
and, seems to hesitate for a moment with her left hand

22
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:33,080
whether to allow him to take that book, or not.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,185
Same with John the Baptist who kneels in prayer towards Christ

24
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:41,130
is on-- a very graceful pose,he kneels down on his right knee

25
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,364
tilts his neck up, and looks up at Christ. We have that high Renascence gracefulness

26
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:50,147
and ideal beuaty. Let's look for just a moment at

27
00:01:50,147 --> 00:01:53,797
the gazes in the painting. I think you're right to start with John the Baptist,

28
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:59,014
and his eyes gazing up at Christ, who in turns body and face moves up to Mary

29
00:01:59,014 --> 00:02:03,113
Mary then returns that gaze and sends our gaze back down

30
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:07,530
to Christ. So, everyone's gaze is really focused on Christ

31
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,864
And now we're sorta in the middle of that triangle

32
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:13,965
as we watch them look at each other. And Mary is ideally

33
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:17,279
beautiful and we have only the faintest outline of a halo

34
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:21,649
that halo is disappearing as we enter the high Renascence, because

35
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:25,489
the figures exude a kind of divinity by their ideal beauty.

36
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:29,448
We don't need that symbol of a halo anymore. And for Raphael, its nature that

37
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:33,864
takes on that role, no longer that stage props of divinity necessary as you said,

38
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:37,697
but its the landscape itself, its god's world, that he has created

39
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:42,629
that is in an expression of divinity, and its beauty itself that is the expression

40
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,213
of divinity here. Mary's beauty, Christ's beauty, and even John's beauty.
