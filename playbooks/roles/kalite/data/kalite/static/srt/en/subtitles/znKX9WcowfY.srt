99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're at Musee d'oRsay and we're looking at Manet portait of Emile Zola who is as very important 19th century novelist

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And art critic Zola behind is an image of Manet Olympia and Olympia seems to look down at Zola and Zola was also a friend of Cezannes. So Zola is an important figure in this circle and this is a really new kind of portrait, a very different

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then we would have had expected it doesn't give us very much

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
information in the way that portrait usually gives us information

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as through the face

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He's actually turned away from us, you've got a sense

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that he is at his desk, at his study while he's turned towards us

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just for a moment as for a pause of reflection not to look at us as through the camera

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for instance, but we have sort of caught him in his odd recordist view

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's really almost a profile.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's something that almost registers emotion there. It's not like he's been absorbed in some odd and looked up from his reading

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There is some eligibility in his face. And I think that quality of / being a narrative, something we see frequently in Manet
