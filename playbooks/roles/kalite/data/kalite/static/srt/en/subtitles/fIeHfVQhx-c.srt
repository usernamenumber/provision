00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:06,959
Use your calculator to find the values of sin 28 degrees and Cosecant of 28 degrees to the nearest thousandth.

2
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:22,880
So I'll do it several ways I'll first let you give a shot at it. Using your calculator try to figure out what the sin of 28 degrees is. Try to figure that out.

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:39,740
Well I'll do it on several calculators first this calculator is kind of a typical scientific calculator no two calculators are completely identical but you want to make sure it is in degree mode because we are dealing with degrees here not radians and it is indeed in degree mode so if we type in 28 and then take the sin of it

4
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,357
So it says sin d - sin in degree mode

5
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:47,106
We want to round to the nearest thousandth so the thousandths place is the 9

6
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:50,690
And then the ten thousands is a four so we want to round down, if this was five or higher we would round up.

7
00:00:50,690 --> 00:01:00,458
So we get 0.469 so we say approximately equal to 0.469

8
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:05,141
It's not exactly equal to it because we are of course rounding.

9
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:08,689
Now let me do that in a different calculator just to get a little bit of variety.

10
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:17,623
This is kind of a traditional graphing calculator and once again we want to make sure that we are in degree mode. So this over here says mode in yellow to get to that yellow function we have to press 2nd first.

11
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:25,559
so press 2nd and then we go to mode and it's good we checked because we see right over here we were in radian mode and we want to be in degree mode

12
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:31,441
So let's go to degree mode just like that so we've set degree mode now let's exit

13
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:34,641
And now let's just take the sin

14
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:39,226
Here we can just type it in the way we can write it on paper so sin of 28 and now we know we are taking degrees

15
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:45,025
And we get the exact same thing 0.469

16
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:48,391
If we round to the nearest thousandth

17
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:55,273
Now let's figure out the cosecant of 28 degrees. Cosecant of 28 degrees what is that going to be?

18
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:58,990
Or roughly equal to if we round to the nearest thousandth.

19
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,039
Well you might remember the cosecant is just the recipricol of the sin.

20
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,149
The sin is opposite over hypotenuse. The cosecant is hypotenuse over opposite.

21
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:14,840
So it is literally just going to be the reciprocal it's just going to be the reciprocal of sin 28 degrees

22
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,547
Or the reciprocal of this value right over here. So we could use either calculator.

23
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:35,457
So this is going to be exactly equal to 1 over the sin of 28 degrees which if we round to the nearest thousandth is going to be, so I can use the graphing calculator first, graphing calculator I can redo the whole thing

24
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:46,573
So 1 divided by I could do the last answer or I could just say 1 divided by sin of 28 degrees which gives us to the nearest thousandth 2.130

25
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:52,478
2.130 and let's verify it's the same thing that we get with the other calculator

26
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:56,086
So this is what we got for the sin of 28 degrees.

27
00:02:56,086 --> 00:03:05,289
If we want to take the reciprocal of this it's literally just 1 over X. 1/X and you see we get the exact same thing 2.130
