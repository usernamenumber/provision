1
00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:06,607
Let's say that I have the Matrix "A" (and we normally denote matrices with bolded capital letters)...

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:17,139
So I have the Matrix "A", and it is a 3 by 2 matrix... and so let's say it's
[1, -2]
[3, 0]
[7, 5]

3
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:26,802
It's a 3 by 2 matrix. And what my question to myself, or to you if you're reading, is: What is the transpose of &quot;A&quot;?

4
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:35,692
And so we denote the transpose like this. "A" with this little superscript "T" right over here. And all this is talking about is the Transpose.

5
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:48,406
The transpose of matrix "A". And so your natural question should be: "Well, what does it mean to take the transpose of a matrix?"

6
00:00:48,406 --> 00:01:07,300
It sounds very fancy. Well... it is not that fancy. All this means is rows become columns, and you can imagine that when rows become columns, the columns become the rows.

7
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:24,073
What do I mean by that? Well... let's do it right over here. So, if I have 3 rows... so let's be clear this is a (1... 2...) 3 rows.... This is 3 rows by (1...) 2 columns. This is a 3 by 2 matrix.

8
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:32,350
If all the rows are going to become columns, then all of the columns are going to become rows... the transpose is going to become a 2 by 3 matrix.

9
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:41,481
It's going to be 2 rows... the 2 columns are going to become the 2 rows... by 3 columns... these 3 rows are going to become 3 columns.

10
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:50,343
And so, it's going to look something like (let me do it in that blue color...) it's going to have 2 rows now, and it's going to have 3 columns.

11
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:55,355
So I said all the rows became columns, and all of the columns became rows... well, I can view it exactly like that.

12
00:01:55,355 --> 00:02:04,149
I have this first row here of [1, -2], I can turn that into my first colum now, of 
[1]
[-2].

13
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:12,263
I have the second row... [3, 0], that will be now my second column:
[3]
[0].

14
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:20,914
And I have this third row... [7, 5]. Well, that is going to be my third column:
[7]
[5].

15
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:28,467
And you could have just as easily viewed it the other way around. You could say, "Look, I have two columns, my first column is:
[1]
[3]
[7]

16
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:32,936
So my first row now is going to be: [1, 3, 7].

17
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:38,227
And then you could say that my second column is:
[-2]
[0]
[5].

18
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:43,030
And so my second row will be [-2, 0, 5].

19
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:50,323
Let's do another example of that... just so that we really make it clear. So let's say we have matrix &quot;B&quot; (once again, bolded, capital letter)...

20
00:02:50,323 --> 00:03:00,217
And let's just say it's a really simple 2 by 2 matrix. So it's:
[-1, 5]
[pi, 3]
are it's entries...

21
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:15,577
What is &quot;B&quot; Transpose going to be equal to? Well once again we have two columns and two rows, so if all the rows become columns and all the columns become rows... I'm still going to have a 2 by 2 matrix...

22
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:26,136
But we just have to say, "Look, my first row here is: [-1, 5], so now that's going to be my first column:
[-1]
[5].

23
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:35,264
I have my second row here, which is: [pi, 3], so now that's going to become my second column:
[pi]
[3].

24
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:39,264
And so, I have taken the transpose. All the rows became columns, and all the columns became rows.
