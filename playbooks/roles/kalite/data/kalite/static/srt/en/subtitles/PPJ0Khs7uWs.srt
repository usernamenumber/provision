1
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,369
What causes water droplets to bounce
when they hit a surface?

2
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:17,160
What determines whether a surface is
hydrophobic or hydrophilic? And what does

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,000
it mean when a surface is superhydrophobic?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,319
It all comes down to surface tension.

5
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:27,599
Surface tension or surface energy is a
tensile or contractile force.

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,699
it's given in unison mutants commuter

7
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,539
which is for screen at length

8
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,990
ordeal for me to squared disparaging per
unit area

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:41,310
service in japan acts like a stretch
elastic membrane kind of like a belated

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,500
because surface tension is is
contractile force each section of the

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,690
blue is pulling on each other resisting
change in cinci

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,790
what causes service and jane

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,060
it's caused by the attractive oracle he
supports a speech in water molecules

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,480
if we look at a poll of likely the
molecules that are inside the poor are

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,340
experiencing cohesive forces with
neighboring molecules

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,690
they're completely surrounded by other
molecules

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,850
and are enjoying their interactions

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,380
the interactive slower the energy seed
of these molecules

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,050
these are happy molecules

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,640
molecules on the surface of the four are
only surrounded by half the number of

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,780
other molecules so they only experience
half the amount of cohesive interactions

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,330
these are unhappy models

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,710
they read a high-ranking d<u>c</u>-ten
molecules inside the poor

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,360
to minimize the number of unhappy
molecules

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,710
but with a justice shape to expose the
smallest possible surface area

26
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,829
that's why water droplets hysterical and
why in space

27
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,160
lots of water all city departments peers

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,110
but what about water droplets resting on
the surface

29
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,580
what determines whether they will be dot
the role of or spread out completely

30
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,970
when a water drop of complexes service
it takes a cheap of hysterical cap

31
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,360
before have we learned that all liquids
have service energy

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,729
actually every single surface-to-surface
energy

33
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,550
a sentence can be thought of as the
interface between two phases

34
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,100
before when we're talking about the
surface tension of the liquid

35
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,619
you were talking about the service and
she between a liquid and air

36
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,739
there's also the service and he
retrieved solid in their

37
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,790
and a certain sense into liquid and
solid

38
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,759
if the congress and the equilibrium
content angle

39
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,269
we can do a force balance on the line of
contact with the surface

40
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,449
we want to balance of forces in the
extraction

41
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:29,029
we have the surface and he became solid
and a prayer

42
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:32,619
the service angie we can sell it and
they put in the opposite direction andy

43
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,379
excluded at the same percentage in tune
with the n<u>b</u>a_ prayer

44
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:39,279
rearranging gives this which is the
answer is

45
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:42,889
once relationships at the continental
that a droplet links of the service is

46
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,489
related to all of the service and cheese

47
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,209
if the equilibrium continental is
greater than ninety degrees the surfaces

48
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:50,859
hydrophobic

49
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:54,679
on the other hand at the continental is
less than ninety degrees the services

50
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:56,430
hydrophilic

51
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,399
intercontinental is bigger than a
hundred fifty degrees

52
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:02,259
the surface is defined as being super
hydrophobic

53
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:06,249
water drum set of super hydrophobic
services will follow up

54
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:08,759
if the continental is less than five
degrees

55
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,789
the surface is defined as being super
hydrophilic

56
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:16,189
large on the set of super hydrophilic
services will spread out completely

57
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:18,839
this is useful for anti file coatings

58
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:23,219
advanced services super hydrophilic any
water that contact the surface will form

59
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,809
a thin film instead of performing
droplets on the surface

60
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:30,799
so what makes a surface super
hydrophobic person for hydrophilic

61
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,759
there to mean factors and press the
surface chemistry

62
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,199
the service can see determines whether
the service has slowed or high surface

63
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,120
seventy

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,069
which then determines whether the
services hydrophobic or hydrophilic

65
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:47,409
generally speaking surfaces with the
both surface energies are hydrophobic

66
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:50,549
and services with high energies are
hydrophilic

67
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,649
thinks i just have fun and other classic
several energy out things such as metals

68
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:56,539
have high energies

69
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,739
the second factors service rep

70
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,989
in general surface roughness will make a
hydrophobic surface even more

71
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:06,129
hydrophobic anna hydrophilic surface
even more hydrophilic

72
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,389
scientists have been trying to determine
what kind of trainee structures mexicans

73
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,219
is super hydrophobic person who had to
fill it

74
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,869
they've been looking and exams need
chairs such as the lunacy to obtain the

75
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:17,789
special properties

76
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:20,689
they're two different states have water
drop it can be and when it comes in some

77
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:22,229
rough surface

78
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,970
to go over these two different miles
we'll cult favorite evite equilibrium

79
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,239
continental

80
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:31,350
which is the continental for and ideal
facts are fixed

81
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,380
mccarthy to start the apparent contact
angle which is the content and go on a

82
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,419
rough surface

83
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:42,150
these two miles were developed by wenzel
and by calcium baxter and they shall

84
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,370
have service records can affect the
water droplets contact angle

85
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,370
the first state that a water droplet npm
when a context of surfaces the wenzel

86
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,470
state

87
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,080
in this state there are no air bubbles
underneath the droplet and the droplet

88
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,090
is incomplete contact with the surface

89
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,820
the drop to actually sticks very well to
the surface and it's called attend

90
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,489
droplet

91
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:04,860
in the wenzel model

92
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,559
the surface roughness is quantified by
our which is the real surface area

93
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,939
divided by the projected service area

94
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,510
since every surface has some sort of
roughness

95
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,069
because no surface it's completely
smooth at the molecular level

96
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,979
we can assume that are is greater than
one

97
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:24,499
the wenzel mock states that could save
data star is eager to our tenth

98
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:26,229
co-signed a<u>t</u>t_

99
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,079
inspire is greater than one the cosine
of data star is greater than the

100
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,919
co-signer dat

101
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,889
this is a very important statement

102
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,770
let's look at what happens when fear he
is less than ninety degrees

103
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,259
if they take he is forty five degrees

104
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,209
n<u>r</u>a_'s nonpoint too

105
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,129
we can calculate the value of the estar

106
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,310
it is starting to have to be thirty two
degrees

107
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,790
so twenty-eight years that's in ninety
degrees we can see that data star is

108
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,749
less than petey

109
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:58,360
now with the devil happens twenty-eight
years greater than ninety degrees

110
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,849
if in fact the value of the akita
hundred thirty five degrees

111
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,379
an article to one point two

112
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,509
we can calculate that the start

113
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:07,909
is equal to

114
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,149
under forty eight degrees

115
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:14,139
now we can see that ada star is greater
than the egg

116
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,519
so when the services hydrophilic

117
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,300
data star is smaller than dating e

118
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,169
month surfaces hydrophobic

119
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:23,800
a two-star is bigger than payday

120
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,560
this equation shows that roughness will
make a hydrophobic surface even more

121
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,699
hydrophobic

122
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,370
and hydrophilic surfaces even more
hydrophilic

123
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,830
in the chocolate is in the kasi back
sixty

124
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,159
the water drama actually sits on top of
tiny air bubbles

125
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,110
in this state

126
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,939
water droplets will bounce a roll off

127
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,659
this is useful for water repellent and
self-cleaning surfaces

128
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:49,009
a service can be self-cleaning because
any water droplets that contact it will

129
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,019
grow up

130
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:52,879
picking up a meter along the way

131
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,830
generally speaking that kasi baxter's
the occurs for a very very rough

132
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,830
services

133
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,400
a special form of the kasi baxter model

134
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,150
just update a star is dependent on the
percent of solid anything contact the

135
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,710
droplet

136
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,839
as is valued approaches zero or in other
words if the tropics sitting mostly on

137
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,220
the air pockets

138
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,490
because an f<u>a</u>a_ test our approach is
negative one and data star approaches a

139
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,099
hundred eighty degrees

140
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,400
so to summarize

141
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,970
how water drop it behaves in a complex a
solid is dependent on service energies a

142
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,669
conflict angle describes whether the
surfaces hydrophobic or hydrophilic

143
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,009
surface roughness can also cause
surfaces to become super hydrophobic or

144
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:37,749
super hydrophilic as shown by the wenzel
or kasi faster model

145
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:42,259
apologetic love how hydrophobicity can
be useful is how the namic decir de

tocqueville its water to drink

147
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,150
this field listened and then a desert in
africa

148
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,580
the beetle has a very special back where
they are a little hydrophilic islands

149
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,319
that are surrounded by hydrophobic areas

150
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,039
tiny farm droplets can collect on the
hydrophilic islands and grow too large a

151
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,449
droplet

152
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,329
once the troubles are large enough

153
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:07,329
the droplets rolled down the beatles
