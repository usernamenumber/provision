1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
   

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,390
What we want to do in this video
is figure out the mass

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:10,480
of calcium carbonate we need
to react completely with 25

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,200
milliliters of 0.75 molar
hydrochloric acid solution.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,530
And we have the reaction here.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,520
And just to remind ourselves
what we're talking about we

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,480
have this hydrochloric acid, and
it is dissolved in water.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,040
It is an aqueous solution.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,600
The solvent is water, and this
0.75 molar tells us the

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,560
molarity of that solution.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,920
It tells us the concentration
or the moles of hydrochloric

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,685
acid per liter of our
entire solution.

13
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:45,880
And we need to figure out the
mass of this calcium carbonate

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,900
that we need to react
completely with the

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,590
hydrochloric acid solution.

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,280
This amount of it.

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,790
Now before we do any
stoichiometric problems, we

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,150
have to make sure that our
actual equation is balanced.

19
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,960
So let's do that first. So on
the left-hand side right here

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,010
we've got a calcium.

21
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,720
That's the only calcium.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,960
And on the right-hand side
we only have 1 calcium.

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,660
So everything looks good from
the calcium point of view.

24
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,620
On the left-hand side we
have a carbon here.

25
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,390
I'll do it in pink.

26
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,880
We have 1 carbon here, and then
we have no carbons here.

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,570
And on the right-hand side
we only have 1 carbon.

28
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,090
Everything looks good so far.

29
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,000
On the left-hand side we
have 3 oxygens, no

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,140
oxygens over here.

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,060
And over here we have 1 oxygen
and then 2 more.

32
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,460
We have 3 on the right-hand
side.

33
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,490
Everything looks good so far.

34
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,380
On the left-hand side we have
1 hydrogen right there.

35
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,130
And then on the right-hand
side we have 2 hydrogens.

36
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,660
We have 2 hydrogens here.

37
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,020
So to balance it let me put 2--
let me put a 2 in front of

38
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,310
the hydrochloric acid, the
aqueous solution of

39
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,780
hydrochloric acid.

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,250
Now the hydrogens balance out,
and we haven't done the

41
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,570
chlorines yet, which is good,
because that would have messed

42
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,430
up everything if they were
already balanced.

43
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:00,810
But let's see.

44
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,550
Now we have 2 chlorines
on the left-hand side.

45
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,210
How many do we have on
the right-hand side?

46
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,590
We have 2.

47
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,580
So now this equation is balanced
after we threw that 2

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,170
coefficient on the hydrochloric
acid.

49
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,940
So now let's figure out what
mass of calcium carbonate do

50
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,550
we need to react completely
with this much of 25

51
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,350
milliliters of a 0.75 molar
hydrochloric acid solution.

52
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,990
Now the whole way to think about
it is I've given-- this

53
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,080
is how this problem is different
than everything else

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,670
we've seen so far is that I
haven't given you the mass of

55
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,890
hydrochloric acid.

56
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,070
I haven't told you the moles
of hydrochloric acid.

57
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,650
I've told you the amount
of solution containing

58
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,350
hydrochloric acid and
the concentration.

59
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,210
So what we're going to do is
take this information to

60
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,820
figure out the moles of
hydrochloric acid in this

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,420
reaction, how many moles do
we have in this solution.

62
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,105
And then for every 2 moles of
hydrochloric acid we're going

63
00:02:58,105 --> 00:03:00,560
to need 1 mole of calcium
carbonate.

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,650
You're going to see that.

65
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,260
And then we just have to figure
out well, given that

66
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,570
we're going to need half as many
moles here as there are

67
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,690
here, how much mass is that.

68
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,020
So let's do that.

69
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:25,810
So we are starting off with the
25 milliliters of-- let me

70
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:33,420
write this-- 0.750 molar HCl
solution, and let's convert

71
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,770
this to moles of hydrochloric
acid.

72
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,570
So the first thing we need to
think about is that molarity

73
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,640
is always expressed in
moles per liter.

74
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,540
This is expressed in milliliters
right now.

75
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,440
So I want to get rid
of the milliliters.

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,040
I want it to be in liters.

77
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,560
So I want to multiply it by
liters-- I'll just write it as

78
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,670
a capital L-- as liters
per milliliter.

79
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,150
And we know we have 1 liter
per 1,000 milliliters, or

80
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,330
there's 1/1000 of a liter per
milliliters, however you want

81
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,080
to view it.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,820
That's going to cancel
out that milliliters.

83
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,160
And then we want to convert--
we want to use this

84
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,800
concentration information to
figure out the actual number

85
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,700
of moles of hydrochloric acid
we're dealing with.

86
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:37,440
So to do that we're going to
multiply it times 0.750 moles

87
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,930
of hydrochloric acid per liter
of-- or I'll write this--

88
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,815
0.750 molar hydrochloric
acid solution.

89
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:55,310
So let me make sure
you understand

90
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,010
what I'm doing here.

91
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,005
I first want to get the 25
milliliters into liters, so

92
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:01,450
I'm going to essentially divide
by 1,000 and the units

93
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,090
will work out.

94
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,790
We have a milliliters in the
numerator, milliliters in the

95
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,680
denominator, we're left
with a liter on top.

96
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,920
And then I want to convert
from the solution to the

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,600
actual number of moles.

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,080
And if something is a-- I could
put a 0 right here--

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:22,220
0.75 molar, that means that
there is 0.75 moles of

100
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,250
hydrochloric acid per liter
of the solution.

101
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,770
This is just-- I'm just
saying you can

102
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,340
call that the solution.

103
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,950
And so this'll cancel out.

104
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,550
We have the liters canceling
out with the liters.

105
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,050
And then you can even say the
of 0.75 molar hydrochloric

106
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,670
acid solution cancels out with
the of .750 molar hydrochloric

107
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,870
acid solution.

108
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,930
And then you're left with--
let me stay in the same

109
00:05:48,930 --> 00:06:04,740
color-- 25 times 1 times 0.750
divided by 1,000 moles of

110
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,160
hydrochloric acid.

111
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,170
And let's get our calculator
out to solve

112
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,180
for this right here.

113
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,100
   

114
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:23,250
So that is, let's see, 25 times
0.75 divided by 1,000 is

115
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,140
equal to 0.01875.

116
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,120
Let me write that down.

117
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:38,040
So this is equal to 0.018--
if I want to stick with

118
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,250
significant digits I really
don't have any more than three

119
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,680
significant digits here, so I
really shouldn't have any more

120
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,780
than three here.

121
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:50,600
So I could say 0.018-- instead
of 75 I'll just round it-- 8

122
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,470
moles of hydrochloric acid.

123
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,100
And now we know that for every
2 moles of hydrochloric acid

124
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,330
we need 1 mole of calcium
carbonate.

125
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,520
So we want to know the moles of
calcium carbonate required.

126
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,550
So let's do that.

127
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,720
So let's multiply this times--
we want this thing

128
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,740
to cancel out here.

129
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,200
We want that to cancel out.

130
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,980
So we want to know, so for every
mole of hydrochloric

131
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,960
acid, or for every 2 moles of
hydrochloric acid, we see that

132
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,460
there, for every 2 moles of
hydrochloric acid we need 1

133
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,980
mole-- I'll do it in that same
orange color-- we need 1 mole

134
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,510
of calcium carbonate
is required.

135
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:42,030
And so these moles of
hydrochloric acid is going to

136
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,200
cancel out with that moles
in the denominator.

137
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,400
And we're essentially just going
to take this number and

138
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,440
multiply it by 1 and divide
by 2, or just essentially

139
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,510
divide it by 2.

140
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,810
So let's do that.

141
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,680
I could just take the original
number right here, divided by

142
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,200
2-- I should only do it three
significant digits-- so it's

143
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,920
really-- well I'll just stay
with this-- so 0, 0, 9, 3, 8

144
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,320
just to round it.

145
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:25,460
So this is equal to, we're left
with 0.00938 moles of

146
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,740
calcium carbonate required.

147
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,630
And we're not done yet.

148
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,460
Remember, the question that we
asked is what's the mass of

149
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,940
calcium carbonate required.

150
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,240
So we need to figure out, we
need to essentially multiply

151
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,159
this times the molar mass.

152
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,850
So we want to convert this into
grams. Let's convert this

153
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,040
into grams. I'll switch colors
just arbitrarily.

154
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,770
And to put it into grams you
have to figure out the molar

155
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,470
mass of calcium carbonate.

156
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,690
And the molar mass of calcium--
you could look up

157
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,390
the atomic weight of calcium
on a periodic

158
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,520
table-- it is 40.

159
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,240
And then you're going to have a
carbon in there, that's 12,

160
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,370
we've seen that a lot.

161
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,470
Then you have an oxygen,
which is 16, but we

162
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,650
have three of them.

163
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,350
So 16 times 3 is 48, so it's
going to be 40 plus 12 plus

164
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,750
48, which is equal to 100.

165
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,130
So it has a molar mass of 100.

166
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:28,740
So times 100 grams of calcium
carbonate for every-- let me

167
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,960
just write that-- grams of
calcium carbonate for every

168
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,950
mole of calcium carbonate.

169
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,970
And we know we're doing the
right thing by multiplying by

170
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,430
100 because these units
cancel out.

171
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,440
Moles of calcium carbonate in
the numerator, moles of

172
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,120
calcium carbonate in
the denominator.

173
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
So those cancel out.

174
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,780
So we essentially just have to
multiply this thing times 100.

175
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,960
So let's do that.

176
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,050
So that thing times 100.

177
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,000
So times 100 is equal to--
and we had rounded

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,800
it-- so it's 0.938.

179
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,670
So let me write that.

180
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,070
0.938.

181
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:16,660
So it equals 0.938 grams
of calcium carbonate.

182
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,910
