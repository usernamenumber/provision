1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,040
In the last video, we learned
that an ellipse can be defined

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,660
as the locus of all points
where the sum of the distances

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,702
to two special points, called
foci-- and let me draw this all

5
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:15,090
out, so that's my x-axis-- the
sum of the distance to these

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,040
two special points, called
focuses or foci, is a constant.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,330
So if this is my ellipse-- I'll
draw it out, that looks about

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,630
where I want it to be right
around, that looks about

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,640
right-- it's centered at the
origin, doesn't have to be, but

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,040
for our purposes, let's make
it centered on the origin.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,170
If this is one focus point
right here, and this is the

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,180
other focus point, this ellipse
could be defined as the set of

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,260
all points, or the locus of all
points, where if I take the

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,920
distance of any one of these
points that exist on the

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,300
ellipse and take the distance
to each of the locuses-- sorry,

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,730
each of the focuses-- if I take
that-- nope, I don't want to do

17
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:08,220
that-- if I take that distance
and add it to this distance, so

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:19,770
let's call this d1-- nope, too
thick-- let's call that d1,

19
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,100
this is d2-- that that's going
to be equal to a constant

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,100
number along the whole ellipse.

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,540
So if I take a random point
along the ellipse, say I take

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:38,930
this point right here, and if I
were to sum this distance to

23
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:48,160
that distance-- so let's call
this d3, this is d4-- the sums

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,840
of these distances to the focus
along with this ellipse are

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,100
going to be a constant.

26
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:58,330
So in this case, d2 plus d1,
this plus that, is going

27
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,120
to be equal to d3 plus d4.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,840
   

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,410
And this would be true wherever
you go along the whole ellipse,

30
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,430
and we learned in the last
video that this quantity is

31
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,715
actually going to be equal to
2a, where a is the distance

32
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,800
of the semi-major radius.

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,830
If this is the formula
for the ellipse, this is

34
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,310
where the a comes from.

35
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,330
x squared over a squared
plus y squared over b

36
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,230
squared is equal to 1.

37
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,750
And we learned that the focus,
the focal distance-- or the

38
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,510
distance from the central of
the ellipse, which is this

39
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,400
distance right here-- that
focal distance is just the

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,640
square root of the difference
of these two numbers.

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,040
If this is the focal distance
from here to here, it's just

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,490
equal to the square root of--
if a is larger then it would be

43
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,220
a squared minus b squared,
which is the case

44
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,200
in this ellipse.

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,430
If we have a vertical ellipse,
and I really didn't cover it in

46
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,450
the last video, but let me just
show you what it

47
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,690
would look like.

48
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,650
Let's say that the ellipse
looks something like this.

49
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,400
   

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,110
I'll use blue.

51
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,560
Let's say the ellipse
looks like that.

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,720
In this case, our semi-major
radius is now in the y

53
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,280
direction, so this is b, this
is a, and in this case, b is

54
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,200
greater than a, because the
ellipse is tall and skinny.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,460
In this case the, focuses
are always going to lie

56
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,900
along the major axis.

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,050
In this case the major axis is
the vertical axis, so the

58
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:43,640
focuses are going to sit here
and here, and in this case, the

59
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,520
focal lengths are going to be
vertical down from the origin

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,550
and vertical up from the
origin, and we get, instead of

61
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,770
it being a squared minus b
squared, now since b is larger

62
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,940
than a, the focal length, which
is this, is going to be equal

63
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,680
to b squared minus a squared.

64
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,040
Fair enough.

65
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,540
Now I did all of that to kind
of compare it to what we're

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,940
going to cover in this video,
which is the focus points or

67
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,360
the foci of a hyperbola.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,750
And a hyperbola, it's very
close to an ellipse, you could

69
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,760
probably guess that, because if
this is the equation of

70
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,000
an ellipse, this is the
equation of a hyperbola.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,340
x squared over a squared
minus y squared over b

72
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,830
squared is equal to 1.

73
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,517
Or we could switch these
around, where the minus

74
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:34,850
is in front of the
x instead of the y.

75
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,870
And we could cover
that in a second.

76
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,810
But this hyperbola looks
something like this.

77
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,000
Let me see if I can draw it.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,410
If I draw the axes, and then I
want to draw the asymptotes--

79
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,250
you could prove it, you could
look at the some of the

80
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,490
previous videos, but the
asymptotes for this hyperbola

81
00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:00,190
are going to be y is equal to
plus or minus b over ax, so

82
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,430
it's going to look-- I'll just
draw them as kind of tilted

83
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,430
lines, so it would look
something like that,

84
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,810
something like-- nope.

85
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,850
I want to make it
something like that.

86
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,630
Those are the as-- but this
one's centered at the origin,

87
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,210
because it hasn't been shifted,
and then that's those

88
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,340
two lines right there.

89
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,370
And then, this is what I call
kind of a horizontal hyperbola.

90
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,180
The way you can think about
that is, well, if you solve for

91
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,830
y, you'll see that you're
always going to be a little

92
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,910
bit lower than the asymptote.

93
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,010
The other option is you say,
OK, can x or y equal 0?

94
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,130
Well if y is equal to 0, that
puts us along the x-axis, and

95
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:54,380
you get x squared over a
squared is equal to 1, which

96
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,090
means that x squared is equal
to a squared, which means that

97
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,260
x is equal to plus or minus a.

98
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:11,350
So the points a,0, and
the point minus a,0, are

99
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,150
both on this hyperbola.

100
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,120
And since they have to kind
of be contained by these

101
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,080
asymptotes, never go through
it, you know that this is going

102
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,795
to be a hyperbola that opens to
the left and the right, so

103
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:23,714
it'll look something like this.

104
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:26,022
Let me use its color.

105
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:29,420
So it'll look something-- this
is the hard part-- it'll get

106
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,890
closer and closer on that side,
and then you kind of view this

107
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,480
as one of the vertexes or
vertices of the hyperbola,

108
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,430
and it'll go like that.

109
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,260
Where this distance-- and
notice the similarity here with

110
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,900
the ellipse-- this distance
right here-- let me do it in a

111
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,430
more vibrant color-- this
distance right here, between

112
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,760
these two I guess you could
call them the elbows of the two

113
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,380
ellipses-- that distance
right there, that is

114
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,980
a, and this is also a.

115
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,300
So you have a 2a distance,
which is very similar to this

116
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,320
situation, where this distance
is a and this distance is a.

117
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,430
So your distance between the
two left and right points in a

118
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,440
horizontal ellipse is the same
as the distance between the two

119
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,130
left and right points
on a hyperbola.

120
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,440
It's just the hyperbola
opens outward while the

121
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,020
ellipse opens inward.

122
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,050
Fair enough.

123
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,620
But the whole point of this
video is to discuss foci, and

124
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,700
you might have guessed-- and I
did touch on it in the last

125
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,580
video-- that hyperbola also
have foci, but they open.

126
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,750
They're going to be to the
right and the left of these two

127
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,190
points, so this is a-- let me
do them in a bright color,

128
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,630
because I want you see them--
let's say that those are the

129
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,810
two foci-- and a hyperbola,
this is-- and notice

130
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,350
the difference.

131
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,760
An ellipse, one of the
definitions of an ellipse, was

132
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,690
the locus of all points or the
set of all points where the

133
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,000
distance from each of those
points, the sum of the distance

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,090
from each of those points to
the two foci is a constant.

135
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,370
Now the definition of a
hyperbola, one of the

136
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,470
definitions of a hyperbola, can
be the locus of all points

137
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,750
where you take the difference--
not the sum, you take the

138
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,840
difference of the distances
between the two foci, so if--

139
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,800
let me write that down.

140
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:24,270
So this is d1, and this is d2,
so you have a situation-- and

141
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,310
we could take the absolute
value of the difference,

142
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,210
because they might be, they
might at some points d1

143
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,340
will be longer than d2
if you're on this curve.

144
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,560
If you're on this curve, d1
will be shorter than d2-- So d1

145
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,820
minus d2, the absolute value is
going to be equal to constant.

146
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,560
In the ellipse situation,
d1 plus d2 was a constant.

147
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,450
So they're very
closely related.

148
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,635
In the ellipse, you're taking
the sum of the distances

149
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:52,730
to the focus points and
saying it's a constant.

150
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,200
In a hyperbola, you're taking
the difference of the distances

151
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,070
to the focus points and
saying that's a constant.

152
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,840
So this number right here is
going to be the exact same

153
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,490
thing as if I took a point
right here-- and I'm picking

154
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,650
these points arbitrarily, as
long as they're on the

155
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:15,530
hyperbola, and if I called
these two points d3 and d4, the

156
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,700
difference between d1 and d2 is
the same thing as the

157
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,910
difference, between
d3 minus d4.

158
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,370
This is going to be a
constant the entire way

159
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,970
around the ellipse.

160
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,400
And so the next question
is, what is this constant

161
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,800
going to be equal to?

162
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,180
And this is where it's useful
to find a point where you can

163
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,270
kind of get the intuition, and
we did it with the ellipses,

164
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,530
where we said if we take these
points, we used logic in the

165
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:49,690
last video to say oh, the sum
of the distance between this

166
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,170
and this, that sum, is going to
be equal to, we saw, is going

167
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,830
to be equal to 2a, or
the distance of the

168
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,680
semi-major axis.

169
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,710
Because this distance was the
same as this distance, so this

170
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:07,970
plus this is the same thing as
this plus that, which is 2a.

171
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,540
So the entire time, the
contents, the sum of the

172
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,130
distances to the two
foci was equal to 2a.

173
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,490
Now in the hyperbola, what
is the difference of the

174
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,830
distances to the two foci?

175
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,650
So let's take this point right
here on the hyperbola, and

176
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,960
we're saying so what is-- let
me do a good color-- what is

177
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,750
the magenta distance-- that's
the distance to that foci--

178
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:40,630
minus this-- let me pick
another color-- minus this

179
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,190
light blue distance?

180
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,500
This magenta distance minus
this light blue distance.

181
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,780
So we can make a very similar
argument that we made in

182
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,520
the ellipse situation.

183
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,100
This light blue distance is the
same, the distance from this

184
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,590
vertex or from this leftmost
point of this rightward opening

185
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,170
hyperbola to this focus is
the same as this distance.

186
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,460
Because a hyperbola is
symmetric around the origin or

187
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,700
the focal length is the same on
either side of the center of

188
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,490
the hyperbola depending on how
you may view it, but I think

189
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,910
that's not too much of a
stretch of a statement for

190
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,600
you to for you to accept.

191
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,500
So if this distance is the same
as this distance, then the

192
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,020
magenta distance minus this
blue distance is going to be

193
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,410
equal to this green distance.

194
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,020
   

195
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,690
And this green
distance is what?

196
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,430
That's 2a.

197
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,920
We saw that at the
beginning of this video.

198
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,130
So this, once again,
is also equal to 2a.

199
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,420
Anyway, I'll leave
you there right now.

200
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,890
Actually, let's actually just
do one problem, just because

201
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,150
I like to make one concrete.

202
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,280
Because I told you at the
beginning that if you wanted to

203
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,395
find the-- so if you have an
ellipse-- so if you have-- this

204
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:56,880
is an ellipse, x squared over a
squared plus y squared over b

205
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,470
squared is equal to 1, we
learned that the-- that's over

206
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,290
b squared-- this is an ellipse.

207
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,980
We learned that the focal
length is equal to the

208
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,960
square root of a squared
minus b squared.

209
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,530
Now for a hyperbola, you kind
of see that there's a very

210
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,540
close relation between the
ellipse and the hyperbola,

211
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,790
but it is kind of a fun
thing to ponder about.

212
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,066
And a hyperbola's equation
looks like this.

213
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:26,870
x squared over a squared minus
y squared over b squared, or it

214
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,030
could be y squared over b
squared minus x squared over

215
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,790
a square is equal to 1.

216
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,980
It turns out, and I'll prove
this to you in the next video,

217
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,460
it's a little bit of a hairy
math problem, that the focal

218
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,490
length of a hyperbola is equal
to the square root of the sum

219
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,940
of these two numbers, is equal
to the sum of a squared

220
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,890
plus b squared.

221
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,360
So if I were to give you--
so notice the difference.

222
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,350
It's just a difference in sign.

223
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,130
You're taking the difference of
those two denominators, and now

224
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,330
you're taking the sum of
the two denominators.

225
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,510
So if I were to give you
the following hyperbola.

226
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:08,870
x squared over 9 plus y squared
over 16 is equal to 1.

227
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,230
Well, the first thing you do
is-- though I've never-- well,

228
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,870
we could just figure out
the focal length just by

229
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,950
plugging into the formula.

230
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,910
The focal length is equal
to the square root of a

231
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,460
squared plus b squared.

232
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,840
This is squared,
right? a is three.

233
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
b is 4.

234
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,490
So 9 plus 16 is 25,
which is equal to 5.

235
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:35,430
And so if we were to graph
this-- that's my y-axis, that's

236
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,970
my x-axis-- and the focal
length is the distance to, in

237
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,640
this case, to the left and
the right of the origin.

238
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,210
If it was kind of an up and
down opening hyperbola, it

239
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,680
would be above and below the
origin, so this is a-- oh

240
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,260
sorry, this should be a plus.

241
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,660
We're doing with a hyperbola,
that should be a minus.

242
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,680
Don't want to confuse you.

243
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,360
What I had written before,
with a plus, that would

244
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,320
have been an ellipse.

245
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,450
A minus is the hyperbola.

246
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,480
So the two asymptotes-- this is
centered at the origin, it

247
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,790
hasn't been shifted-- are going
to be 16 over 9, so it's going

248
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,050
to be fairly steep asymptotes,
it's going to look something

249
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:14,620
like that and that, those
are the two asymptotes--

250
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,920
The two vertex points are at 2
times a. a is three, right?

251
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,930
a squared is equal to 9, b
squared is equal to 16, so this

252
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,920
is the center, so the two
vertex points, this is 3 minus

253
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,410
3, and then the focal points
are going to be at, from the

254
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,860
center, 5 to the right, so
that's going to be right here,

255
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:43,730
so that's 5,0, and minus 5,0.

256
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,870
This is minus 3, and this is 3,
so if we were to graph it, it

257
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,920
would look something like this.

258
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,900
   

259
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,110
There you go.

260
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,830
And if you were to take an
arbitrary point on that

261
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,540
hyperbola and take this
distance and subtract that from

262
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,420
that distance, that will be a
constant number that would be

263
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,760
exactly equal to 2a or exactly
equal to 6, in this

264
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,810
particular example.

265
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,400
Anyway.

266
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,397
Hopefully I didn't confuse you
too much with that little sign

267
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:17,260
error near the end of the
video, but in the next video,

268
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,620
I'll prove to you this formula,
which is a little bit of hairy

269
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,980
algebra but it's fun
to do regardless.

270
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,193
