1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I didn't even copy and paste all these.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But I can already see that these are positive y values.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So A was the answer.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm sorry, I ran out of space.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All of these y values, they're all negative.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You're staying in the third and fourth quadrant.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All right, next video.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Problem 5

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Two airplanes left the same airport travelling in opposite

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
directions.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If one plane averages 400 miles/hour--so this is

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the airport.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
One plane goes in that direction at

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
400 miles per hour.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a mile not a meter.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And another plane averages 250 miles per hour.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it's going in the other direction.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I do this as vectors.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the length of my arrow represents its

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
speed to some degree.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the direction represents direction.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
250 miles per hour in that direction, 400 miles per hour

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in that direction.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In how many hours will the distance between the two

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
planes be 1625 miles?

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you just have to say, if you're sitting in this plane

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right here, this plane to the left.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you let's say you think you're stationary.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How fast is that plane going to be moving to the rightwards

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
direction, or I guess to the eastward direction?

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well from your point of view, it's going to be going in the

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
east direction at 650 miles per hour.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you thought that you were stationary, it would just be

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going away from you at 650 miles per hour.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Same thing, if you were sitting in this plane right

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here, and you thought you were stationary- -and you are,

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
relative to yourself--you'd say, oh, why this guy is going

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the west t 650 miles per hour relative to me.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're starting at the same point.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this just becomes a standard distance is equal to

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
rate times time problem.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we have to cover 1625 miles, because that's what

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they want to know, when does that happen

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
At what point are the planes that far from each other

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That is equal to their relative velocity, they're

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
separating from each other at 650 miles per hour.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we want to know how long is that going to take?

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So time is going to equal 1625 divided by 650.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see if we can simplify that at all.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we could divide the top and the bottom by 25.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we divide the top one--let me just get my calculator.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 1625 divided by 650 is equal to 2.5.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we were doing everything in miles per hour.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So time is going to be equal to 2.5 hours.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The choice is A.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Problem 76.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll just copy and paste all these word problems. We'll

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
parse them together.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Problem 76 in green.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lisa will make punch that is 25% fruit by adding pure fruit

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
juice to a two liter mixture that is 10% pure fruit juice.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How many liters of pure fruit juice does she need to add?

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Pure fruit juice.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let P equal liters of pure.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's what they want us to figure out.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have to figure out P.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All right.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And adding it to a two liter mixture, So so let's say M is

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to the liters of the mixture.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to the liters of the mixture.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That is 10% fruit juice.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that is this right here, to a two liter mixture, that is

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
10% fruit juice.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're calling that M.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That is the two liter mixture that is 10% fruit juice.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, how many liters of pure fruit juice

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
does she need to add?

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, so let's think about it a little bit.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, punch is going to be pure juice.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's think about how much pure juice is going to be in

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the system.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The liters of pure juice she adds, plus the

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
liters of the mixture.

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well it's a two liter mixture that is 10% fruit juice.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So how much fruit juice is already there?

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's 0.2 liters of fruit juice.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I should'nt even define M, we know that M is equal to 2.

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So ignore that.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can tell I'm doing these problems in real time.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm struggling with them as yoou would.

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway, so how much fruit juice is there going to be in

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the mixture?

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's the amount of liters of the pure

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
fruit juice she adds.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a pure fruit juice, that's P.

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then you're going to have the two filters of the mixture.

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is 10% fruit juice.

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So how much fruit juice is coming from that?

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well 10% of two liters is 0.2 liters already.

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then how many liters is there going

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to be in the mixture?

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the combined, how many total liters are there?

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, there's the liters of the pure fruit juice, plus the

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
two liters that we're adding to.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the amount of fruit juice.

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a total amount of liquid.

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we got the 0.2 from 10% times 2.

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we said that this has to equal to 25%.

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We want this to be 25% of this.

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this should be 0.25.

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That was an inadvertent mark right down there.

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So now we just solve for P.

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The hard part is setting up the problem.

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's multiply P plus 2 times both sides.

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you get P plus 0.2 is equal to 0.25 times this.

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 0.25P plus 0.25 times 2 is 0.5.

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Fair enough.

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's subtract 0.2 from both sides.

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You get P is equal to 0.25P, 0.5 minus 0.2 is plus 0.3.

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's subtract 0.25P from both sides.

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1P minus 0.25P is 0.75P is equal to 0.3.

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let's see where this goes.

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Did I do that right?

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.75P is equal to 0.3.

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right.

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The decimals sometimes get confusing.

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's multiply both side\s of this equation by 10.

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You get 7.5P is equal to 0.3.

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sorry, is equal to 3, we multiplied by 10.

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you get P is equal to 3 over 7.5.

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How many times does 7.5 go into 3?

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's the same thing as how many times

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
does 75 go into 30.

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Put a decimal sign.

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see, it goes into it I think four times.

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's 0.4.

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So P is equal to 0.4 liters.

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have to add 0.4 liters of pure fruit juice to the two

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
liter mixture.

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you add 0.4 to the two liter mixture, so you end up

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with 0.6 liters of pure fruit juice.

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the numerator becomes 0.6.

144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the denominator becomes 2.4.

145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which, sure enough, is 1/4 or 25%.

146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Fascinating problem.

147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Next question.

148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And these are good to learn.

149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A lot of times in math class people are like, what do I

150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
need to learn this for?

151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But this type of algebra, you're going to

152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
use it all the time.

153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Especially if you go into any type of science or

154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
engineering.

155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or, for that matter, investing or finance.

156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You're going to use these kind of, boy can I figure this out

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or not type of equations all the time when you're mixing

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
things and figuring out margins and all the rest.

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, let's see.

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which relation is a function?

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I have a little bit of a review of a function.

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So a function is a relation that maps from

163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a domain to a range.

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to say from A to B.

165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or we could say from the domain to the range.

166
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Where it takes one set of numbers, which you call the

167
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
domain, and we have another set of numbers.

168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And for every number here, there's exactly one

169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
number in the range.

170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's the key.

171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
From here to here, there's only one number.

172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now two of these could meet the same number.

173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But you can't have one number here going to two separate

174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
numbers there.

175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the key.

176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Here we have the same number.

177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You have a minus 2 here.

178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you have a minus 2 here.

179
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's like the same number.

180
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say this is a minus 2.

181
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That minus 2 is going to a 6 and here it's

182
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to minus 2.

183
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you have the same number going to

184
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
two different numbers.

185
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can't have that in a function.

186
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For any given number in the domain, you definitely get

187
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
only one in the range.

188
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So A is not the answer.

189
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see, does this have that same problem?

190
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
See every number is there exactly once.

191
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You have one minus 2, one 0, one 1, one 2, so you're not

192
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to have that problem.

193
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My suspicion is it's already B.

194
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
C has the same problem.

195
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4 goes to a bunch of different nummbers.

196
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4 goes to 0, 4 goes to 1, so it's not C.

197
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then this defines two values for 10.

198
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that doesn't work either.

199
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the answer is B.

200
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Problem 78.

201
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All right.

202
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For which equation graphed below, are all

203
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the y values negative?

204
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if all the y values are negative, we have to say

205
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
below the x-axis.

206
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is where all the y values are negative, right there.

207
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this one seems to work.

208
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A seems to work.

209
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Here, these aren't negative y values.

210
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These are positive y values.

211
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is airport

212
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one plane goes that direction

213
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
400 mile per hour

214
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
250 this is back , a kind of length our represents

215
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's be to some represents of the direction

216
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
250 m/h and 400 m/h

217
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you had to say if

218
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you were sitting in this plane right here, and this planes were left

219
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you don't know, you know, let's say you think you're stationary

220
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how fast is that plane going to move to the right word direction, and I'm guessing

221
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's east, and east direction, or from your point you gonna

222
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this gonna be going to the east direction at 650 m/h

223
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right, if you taught, you were stationary. just be going to be away from

224
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
625 m/h

225
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
same thing, if you were sitting in this plane right here

226
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if you taught, you were stationary. you were relative to yourself, if you say, oh

227
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this guys going to the west. and 650 m/h relative

228
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to me starting at the same point. so it just becomes a standard distance

229
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
distance is equal to rate times time problem. so if you had a cover

230
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1625 mile because ask, they wanna know, you know, when does

231
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
happen at what point other planes that far from each other

232
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is equal to, there're relative velocity

233
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there're separating from each other. 650 miles per hour

234
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we wanna know how long it's going to take

235
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so time is going to equal 6

236
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1625 divided by 650

237
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if you can simplify that it all

238
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well, you can divid the

239
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
top and bottom by 25

240
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right, divid top one of, let me just calicutrator

241
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so 1625

242
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
divid by 25

243
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to 2.5

244
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so time, if do everything miles per hour, time is going to be 2.5

245
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hours, that choice A

246
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
problem 76, I just copy and paste

247
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this word problem, person together, problem

248
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
76, in green

249
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
green, Lisa will male punch

250
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so just let p

251
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to liters of

252
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pure. that's why, that's why they want to just figure out

253
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
figure out p

254
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
alright, let's say that

255
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2 liter mixture, so let's say m is equal to liter

256
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of mixture

257
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's 10 percent

258
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right, so that's this right here

259
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2 liter mixture that is 10% fruit juice, what calling that

260
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
M

261
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's 2 liters mixture is 10% fruit juice

262
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
okay, how many liters of pure fruit juice dose she need to add

263
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's think about little bit

264
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the total amount of she just gonna

265
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
she going to add punch, so punch is going to be pure juice

266
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
she wants something like how much pure juice is going to be

267
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the system. there's pure juice

268
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
adds plus liters of mixture

269
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2 liters mixture that is 10% of fruit juice. so how much fruit juice are already there. so it's 2 points

270
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of liter juice

271
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right, it's 2 liter mixture, oh you know actually in the fine

272
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
find them. m is equal to 2

273
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so ignore that

274
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can done. you can just doing problem at the real time. I'm struggling with them as you well

275
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
anyway, how much fruit juice is it going to be in mixture?

276
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there is amount of liters of the pure fruit juicy a

277
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then, pure fruit juice

278
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's p, and then you gonna have the 2 liters of mixture that is 10% of fruit juice. how much fruit

279
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
juice is coming from that?

280
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well. 10%

281
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of liters, o.2 litters already

282
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then how many liters is there going to be in the mixture? combined

283
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how many liter are there? there is pure fruit juice

284
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus 2 liters, we're adding to

285
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is amount of fruit juice. this is total amont of

286
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
liquid. right, we got 0.2 times from 10% times

287
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2

288
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we sad this has to be equal to 2

289
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
25 percent. we want this to be 25 percent of this. this should be 0

290
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.5. there was in bed mark

291
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now on there, solve for repeat

292
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hard part of setting up a problem. so let's say p multiply

293
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
p plus 2times both sides

294
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you gonna get p

295
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus 0.2 is equal to0.2 times this

296
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.25p plus

297
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.25 times 2 is point 5, fair enoigh

298
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's subtract 0.2 from both side,you get p is

299
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equal to 0.25p 0.5 minus 0.2

300
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus 0.3

301
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's subtract 0.
