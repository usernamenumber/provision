1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,980
In this presentation, I
actually want to show you how

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,730
we can use the antiderivative
to figure out the

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,340
area under a curve.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,695
Actually I'm going to focus
more a little bit more

6
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:10,770
on the intuition.

7
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,960
So let actually use an
example from physics.

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,640
I'll use distance and velocity.

9
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,550
And actually this could be a
good review for derivatives,

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,590
or actually an application
of derivatives.

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,610
So let's say that I
described the position

12
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,500
of something moving.

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,160
Let's say it's s.

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:35,520
Let's say that s is equal to,
I don't know, 16t squared.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,850
Right?

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,880
So s is distance.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,120
Let me write this
in the corner.

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,220
I don't know why the
convention is to use s as

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,250
the variable for distance.

20
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,400
One would think, well actually,
I know, why won't they use d?

21
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,740
Because d is the letter used
for differential, I guess.

22
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:55,800
So s is equal to distance,
and then t is equal to time.

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,990
   

24
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,580
So this is just a formula that
tells us the position, kind of

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,210
how far has something
gone, after x many, let's

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,140
say, seconds, right?

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,620
So after like, 4 seconds, we
would have gone, let's say

28
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,750
the distance is in feet,
this is in seconds.

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,690
After 4 seconds, we would
have gone 256 feet.

30
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,660
That's all that says.

31
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,250
And let me graph that as well.

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,120
Graph it.

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,620
That's a horrible line.

34
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,430
Have to use the line tool,
might have better luck.

35
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,400
   

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,730
It's slightly better.

37
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,110
Actually, let me undo that too,
because I just want to do

38
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,200
it for positive t, right?

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,480
Because you can't really
go back in time.

40
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,340
For the purposes of this
lecture, you can't

41
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,520
go back in time.

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,810
So that'll have to do.

43
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,820
So this curve will essentially
just be a parabola, right?

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,720
It'll look something like this.

45
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,700
   

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,790
So actually, if you
look at it, I mean you

47
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,100
could just eyeball it.

48
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,590
The object, every second you
go, it's going a little

49
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,410
bit further, right?

50
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,990
So it's actually accelerating.

51
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,880
And so what if we wanted to
figure out what the velocity

52
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,960
of this object, right?

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,580
This is, let's see, this
is d, this is t, right?

54
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,630
And this is, I don't know
if it's clear, but this is

55
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,780
kind of 1/2 a parabola.

56
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,900
So this is the
distance function.

57
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,330
What would the velocity be?

58
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,170
Well the velocity is
just, what's velocity?

59
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,590
It's distance divided
by time, right?

60
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,490
And since this velocity
is always changing, we

61
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,570
want to figure out the
instantaneous velocity.

62
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,620
And that's actually one of the
initial uses of what made

63
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,930
derivatives so useful.

64
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,430
So we want to find the change,
the instantaneous change

65
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,450
with respect to time of
this formula, right?

66
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,350
Because this is the
distance formula.

67
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,410
So if we know the instant rate
of change of distance with

68
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,310
respect to time, we'll
know the velocity, right?

69
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:02,040
So ds, dt, is equal to?

70
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,550
So what's the derivative here?

71
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:09,280
It's 32t, right?

72
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,320
And this is the velocity.

73
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,060
   

74
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,660
Maybe I should switch back
to, let me write that,

75
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,360
v equals velocity.

76
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,880
I don't know why I switched
colors, but I'll stick

77
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,250
with the yellow.

78
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,510
So let's graph this function.

79
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,680
This will actually be a fairly
straightforward graph to draw.

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,670
   

81
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,270
It's pretty straight.

82
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,160
And then we draw the x-axis.

83
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,910
   

84
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,390
I'm doing pretty good.

85
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:43,790
OK.

86
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,010
   

87
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:56,370
So this, I'll draw it in
red, this is this going

88
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,420
to be a line, right?

89
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,450
32t it's a line with slope 32.

90
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,530
So it's actually a
pretty steep line.

91
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,640
I won't draw it that steep
because I'm going to use

92
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,880
this for an illustration.

93
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,855
So this is the velocity.

94
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:09,990
   

95
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,580
This is velocity.

96
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,330
This is that graph, and
this is distance, right?

97
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,970
So in case you hadn't learned
already, and maybe I'll do a

98
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,470
whole presentation on kind of
using calculus for physics, and

99
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,000
using derivatives for physics.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,460
But if you have to distance
formula, it's derivative

101
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,730
is just velocity.

102
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,830
And I guess if you view
it the other way, if you

103
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,920
have the velocity, it's
antiderivative is distance.

104
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,800
Although you won't know
where, at what position,

105
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,770
the object started.

106
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,080
In this case, the object
started at position of 0,

107
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,420
but it could be, you know,
at any constant, right?

108
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,210
You could have started
here and then curved up.

109
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,140
But anyway, let's just
assume we started at 0.

110
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,170
So the derivative of distance
is velocity, the antiderivative

111
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,350
of velocity is distance.

112
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,020
Keep that in mind.

113
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,130
Well let's look at this.

114
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:03,880
Let's assume that we were
only given this graph.

115
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,520
And we said, you know,
this is the graph of the

116
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,850
velocity of some object.

117
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,930
And we want to figure out what
the distance is after, you

118
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,220
know, t seconds, right?

119
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,340
So this is the t-axis, this
is the velocity axis, right?

120
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,490
So let's say we were only given
this, and let's say we didn't

121
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,590
know that the antiderivative of
the velocity function is

122
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,250
the distance function.

123
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,340
How would we figure out, how
would we figure out what

124
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,360
the distance would be
at any given time?

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,530
Well let's think about it.

126
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,080
If we have a constant, this
red is kind of bloody.

127
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,150
Let me switch to
something more pleasant.

128
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,340
If we have, over any small
period of time, right, or if we

129
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,090
have a constant velocity, when
you have a constant velocity,

130
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,990
distance is just velocity
times time, right?

131
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,030
So let's say we had
a very small time

132
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,090
fragment here, right?

133
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,190
I'll draw it big, but let's
say this time fragment

134
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,640
it is really small.

135
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,330
And let's called this very
small time fragment, let call

136
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,480
this delta t, or dt actually.

137
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,120
The way I've used dt is like,
it's like a change in time

138
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,040
that's unbelievably
small, right?

139
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,490
So it's like almost
instantaneous, but not quite.

140
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,410
Or you can actually view
it as instantaneous.

141
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,710
So this is how much
time goes by.

142
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,390
You can kind of view this as
a very small change in time.

143
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,040
So if we have a very small
change of time, and over that

144
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,510
very small change in time,
we have a roughly constant

145
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,500
velocity, let's say the roughly
constant velocity is this.

146
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,250
   

147
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,600
Right, this is the velocity, so
say we had over this very small

148
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,210
change in time, we have this
roughly constant velocity

149
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,210
that's on this graph.

150
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,720
Actually, let me
take do it here.

151
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,400
We have this roughly
constant velocity.

152
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,870
So the distance that the object
travels over the small time

153
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,650
would be the small time
times the velocity, right?

154
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,150
It would be whatever the value
of this red line is, times the

155
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,340
width of this distance, right?

156
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,230
So what's another way?

157
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,950
Visually I kind of did
it ahead of time, but

158
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,900
what's happening here?

159
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,120
If I take this change in time,
right, which is kind of the

160
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,890
base of this rectangle, and I
multiply it times the velocity

161
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,750
which is really just the height
of this rectangle, what

162
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,510
have I figured out?

163
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,790
Well I figured out the area
of this rectangle, right?

164
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,390
Right, the velocity this
moment, times the change in

165
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,040
time at this moment, is
nothing but the area of

166
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,130
this very skinny rectangle.

167
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,210
Skinny and tall, right?

168
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,080
It's almost infinitely skinny,
but it's, we're assuming for

169
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,040
these purposes it has some very
notional amount of width.

170
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,990
So there we figured out the
area of this column, right?

171
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,510
Well, if we wanted to figure
out the distance that you

172
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:50,960
travel after, let's say, you
know, I don't know, let's say

173
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,010
t, let's say t sub
nought, right?

174
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,710
This is just a particular t.

175
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,980
After t sub nought
seconds, right?

176
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,840
Well then, all we would have to
do is, we would have to just

177
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,010
figure, we would just do
a bunch of dt's, right?

178
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,900
You'd do another one here,
you'd figure out the area of

179
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,630
this column, you'd figure out
the area of this column, the

180
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,490
area of this column, right?

181
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,970
Because each of these areas
of each of these columns

182
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,690
represents the distance
that the object travels

183
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,610
over that dt, right?

184
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,506
So if you wanted to know how
far you traveled after t sub

185
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:33,340
zero seconds, you'd essentially
get, or an approximation would

186
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,210
be, the sum of all
of these areas.

187
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,110
And as you got more and more,
as you made the dt's smaller

188
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,430
and smaller, skinnier,
skinnier, skinnier.

189
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,810
And you had more and more and
more and more of these

190
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,930
rectangles, then your
approximation will get pretty

191
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,700
close to, well, two things.

192
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,320
It'll get pretty close to, as
you can imagine, the area

193
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,230
under this curve, or
in this case a line.

194
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,870
But it would also get you
pretty much the exact amount

195
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,720
of distance you've traveled
after t sub nought seconds.

196
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,410
So I think I'm running into the
ten minute wall, so I'm just

197
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,600
going to pause here, and I'm
going to continue this in

198
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,280
the next presentation.
