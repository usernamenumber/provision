00:00:00,488 --> 00:00:08,933
Let's work through another few senarios involving displacement, velocity and time or distance, rate and

2
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:17,467
time. So over here we have Ben is running at a constant velocity of 3m/s to the east, three meters

3
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:23,800
per second to the east and this is a review, this is a vector quanity they are giving us the magnitude

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,533
and the direction, if they just said three meters per second then that would just be speed, this is

5
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:39,933
the magnitude its 3m/s and it is to the east and they are giving us the direction so this is a vector

6
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:51,867
quantity that's why it's velocity instead of speed. How long will it take him to travel 720 meters? I

7
00:00:51,867 --> 00:01:01,733
will do it both with the vector version and maybe they should say how long it will take it to travel 720 meters to the east.

8
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:10,000
Make sure that I make it clear that it is a vector quantity because displacement suppose to distance

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,933
We will do it both ways. If we think about just the scalar version of it we said already that rate or

10
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:25,667
speed is equal to the distance you travel over some time. Some time people will write a triangle or delta

11
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:37,467
there for change in time. That\'s explicitly ment when you just write over time like that. So rate or

12
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:43,400
speed is equal to distance divided by time, now if you know they're giving us in this problem, they're

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,867
giving us the rate, if we think about the scaler part of it they're giving us the rate, they're telling

14
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:56,067
us that is 3m/s they're also telling us the time, or sorry they're not telling us the time, they're

15
00:01:56,067 --> 00:02:02,133
telling us the distance and they want us to figure out the time. So they tell us the distance 720 meters

16
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:12,800
and so we just have to figure out the time. So we have, if we just do the scalar version we're not dealing

17
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:25,667
with velocity and displacement, we're dealing with rate or speed and distance. So we have 3m/s=720 meters or

18
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:40,467
some change in time. So we can algebracially manipulate this, we muiltiply both sides by time right over

19
00:02:40,467 --> 00:03:04,600
there. And then we could take this once step at a time, so 3m/s times time is equal to 720 meters. And

20
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:12,600
that makes sense at least units wise because time is going to be in seconds and it cancels out with the

21
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,467
seconds in the denominator so you will just get meters so that just makes sense there. So if you want

22
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:26,467
to solve for time you can divide both sides by 3m/s and then on the left side they cancel out on the

23
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:39,333
right hand side this is going to be equal to720 divided by 3 times meters then m/s of the denominator,

24
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:49,733
if you bring it out to the numerator you take the inverse of it so that's m, meters was on top, so 720

25
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:57,933
meters and now you're dividing by m/s and that's the same thing as multiplying by the inverse times s/m

26
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:05,458
and so what you're going to get here the meters are going to get 720 divided by three seconds so what

27
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:13,733
is that, 720 divided by 3, 72 divided by 3 is 24, so this is going to 240 this part riight over is going

28
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:21,267
to be 240. It's going to be 240 seconds, that's the only unit we're left with. On the left hand side

29
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:31,667
we just had the time, so the time is 240 seconds. Sometimes you'll see it and just to show you know in

30
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:36,800
some physics classes they show all these formulas, one thing i really want you to understand as we go

31
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,267
through this this journey together is that all those formulas are really algebraic minupulations of each other. You really

32
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:50,067
shouldn't memorize any of them you should always, hey that's just manipulating one of those other formulas

33
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,267
that i got before. One of those, even these formulas are only reasonably common sense. So you can start

34
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:57,267
from very common sense things rate as distance divided by time and then just manipulate it to get other

35
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:03,267
common sense things so we could've done it here. We could've multiplied both sides by time before we
