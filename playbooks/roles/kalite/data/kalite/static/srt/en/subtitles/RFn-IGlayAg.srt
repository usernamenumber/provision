1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
I've been doing a bunch of videos about logarithmic scale

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,432
and we've also -- unfortunately -- had many notable earthquakes this year

3
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:10,025
so I thought I would do a video on the Richter Scale,

4
00:00:10,025 --> 00:00:14,862
which is a way to measure - which is a way to measure earthquake magnitudes.

5
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:19,074
And just to be clear, although we associate the Richter Scale as the way we measure earthquakes now

6
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:23,245
the one we actually use now is the Moment Magnitude Scale,

7
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:28,276
and the reason why most people don't make a huge differentiation between the two is that

8
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:32,648
the Moment Magnitude scale was calibrated to the Richter Scale

9
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:35,156
for the whole reason why we moved to the Moment Magnitude Scale

10
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:40,438
is that the Richter Scale starts to kind of max out at around magnitude 7 earthqukes.

11
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:44,972
So this gives us a much better way to measure things that are above a magnitude 7.

12
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:49,568
So this right here is a picture of Charles Richter, he's passed away,

13
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:53,734
but this is from an interview that he gave, and it's interesting because it kinda

14
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:57,265
gives the rationale for how he came up with the Richter Scale.

15
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:01,638
"I found a paper by Professor K. Wadati of Japan in which he compared

16
00:01:01,638 --> 00:01:07,562
large earthquakes by plotting the maximum ground motion against the distance to the epicenter."

17
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:10,785
So this Professor K. Wadati would -- you could imagine --

18
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:14,205
he did a plot like this, where this is distance -- distance --

19
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:19,049
So if you have an earthquake someplace, you aren't always sitting right on top of the epicenter

20
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,257
where you measure it.

21
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:22,080
You might be sitting over here. You're actually measure --

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,179
your measuring stations might be some distance away.

23
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:28,245
So he looks at how far the measuring station was and then he looks at

24
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:33,562
the ground motion at the measuring station. So that would be some earthquake over there.

25
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:37,193
A relatively -- let's say that's a relatively medium earthquake.

26
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:39,112
This right over here would be a weak earthquake

27
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:40,920
because you're close to the earthquake

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,359
and it still didn't move the ground much. So I mean this is the magnitude,

29
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,264
this axis is the magnitude.

30
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:47,883
How much the ground is moving.

31
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:51,100
And then for example, this would be a very strong earthquake.

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,926
And then Charles Richter said in the interview:

33
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:55,908
"I tried a similar procedure for our stations,

34
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,685
but the range between the largest and smallest magnitudes seemed

35
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,288
unmanageably large."

36
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,622
So what he's saying is when he tried to plot it like Professor Wadati,

37
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:08,454
he found that: Ok you can put -- you get some earthquakes that you can plot around here,

38
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:13,609
but no matter how you create a linear scale, no matter how you do a linear scale over here,

39
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:15,745
if you want any resolution down here,

40
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:18,663
the stronger earthquakes go off the charts, or maybe off the page.

41
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:22,216
So the stronger earthquakes you might have to start plotting here, or here,

42
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:25,096
or maybe they don't even fit on the page.

43
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:29,019
And so he says "Dr. Bino Gutenburg --" And they were all working at CalTech when

44
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:33,856
they came up with the Richter Scale. "Dr. Bino Gutenburg then made the natural suggestion

45
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:41,931
to plot the amplitudes logarithmically. I was -- I was lucky because logarithmic plots are a device of the devil."

46
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:45,567
And I'm not really sure what he means when he says they were "a device of the devil,"

47
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:49,616
I'm assuming he means that they're kind of magical, that all of a sudden you can take these things,

48
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:52,062
that you want your resolution down here

49
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:54,493
or you want to be able to tell the difference between these weak earthquakes,

50
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:57,558
but at the same time you want to be able to compare them to the large earthquakes.

51
00:02:57,558 --> 00:03:01,837
And he thought -- I guess he viewed them as a bit of a magical instrument.

52
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:06,577
And we say that they are logarithmic -- or he plotted them on a logarithmic scale --

53
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:11,078
what essentially it is he's saying -- is essentially taking the logarithm of the

54
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:13,593
magnitude of every one of those earthquakes.

55
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,815
So if you're measuring the earthquake, maybe on the

56
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:19,235
seismograph, so this is before the earthquake, then the earthquake hits,

57
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:24,454
and then the earthquake stops and then you measure the amplitude of this earthquake.

58
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,780
If you just plotted them linearly, you'd have the problem that he saw

59
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,125
or if you tried to plot them the way that Professor Wadati did you'd have that problem,

60
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,358
but what he did is that he measures this now and he plots the logarithm --

61
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:41,734
the logarithm of that, and so what happens is that you get a scale that is plotted -- or that you

62
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:44,500
get a logarithmic scale, for lack of a better word.

63
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,819
But what I want to do in this video is think about what implication that has

64
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,821
for the magnitude of earthquakes, especially some of the earthquakes that we have seen lately.

65
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:57,023
So this right here is the earthquake that occured August 23rd on the East Coast of the United States

66
00:03:57,023 --> 00:03:59,825
and it wasn't that strong of an earthquake, it was a 5.8,

67
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:02,688
that's not a small earthquake, you would definitely feel it, it's a good bit of shaking

68
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,809
it could even cause some minor damage.

69
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:08,282
But the reason why it's notable is because it happened in a part of the world

70
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,930
that does not see earthquakes too frequently.

71
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,462
So let's just take that on our scale. I'm going to go down way over here.

72
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,666
So I'm going to do our scale over here.

73
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,993
So let's just put that as a 5.8.

74
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,641
I'm going to call this a 5.8.

75
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:22,921
So if you shake your seat fairly fairly vigorously, it might help you

76
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:26,048
know what it felt like on top of that earthquake,

77
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:28,904
so this is 2011 East Coast Earthquake.

78
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:36,769
And then probably the most famous earthquake in the United States is the one that occurred

79
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:41,960
at Loma Prieta over here about 40 or 50 miles south of

80
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,839
San Francisco -- and this is damage caused in San Francisco,

81
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,622
a freeway collapsed right over here, and this whole area actually became very nice after they removed

82
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,527
this freeway.

83
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:55,729
But you can imagine how powerful this was, that it was able to cause this type of damage this far away

84
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,862
And actually I live right over here, so I'm glad I wasn't around

85
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:03,044
or I wasn't in the Bay Area during that earthquake.

86
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:07,037
But that earthquake, I've -- depending on how you measure it -- is a 7.0. So that earthquake measured

87
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:11,496
at a 7.0,

88
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:13,400
so let's call this this over here is 7.

89
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,649
Let's do that in a color you're going to see. So that earthquake

90
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:20,482
was a 7.

91
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:25,730
Loma Prietta. That's in the San Francisco Bay area, and that earthquake was in

92
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,911
1989, it happened actually right before the World Series.

93
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,997
And then in 2011 an very unfortunate

94
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:35,784
earthquake in japan, the tohoku earthquake,

95
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:39,313
Right over here, this circle shows the magnitude of the earthquake,

96
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:41,055
it was off the coast of Japan

97
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:42,912
All of these were the after shocks,

98
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:45,281
and the damage it caused was actually the tsunami it caused

99
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:48,485
and the damage it did to the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant

100
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:53,083
well sometimes it's called 8.9 or 9.0,

101
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,426
let's just call that a 9.0 for simplicity.

102
00:05:56,426 --> 00:06:01,581
So this is almost 6 and this would be 7 and at 8 would get us almost over there and

103
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:10,498
so 9.0 is right over there, so this is 2011 Japan -- the earthquake in Japan.

104
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:16,163
And the greatest earthquake ever recorded was the Chilean earthquake in

105
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:20,575
1960, that was a 9.5, so 9.5

106
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:23,803
would stick us right over here.

107
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:29,631
And this is the 1960 earthquake in Chile.

108
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,349
And to just give us a sense, you know

109
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,323
when you look at this, if this was a linear scale,

110
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:35,459
you'd say that the Chilean earthquake was

111
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,776
a little bit than twice as bad as the East Coast earthquake, and that doesn't seem as bad

112
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,841
until you realize that it isn't a linear scale, it's a logarithmic scale

113
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:53,710
and the way that you interpret it is thinking about how many powers of ten one of these earthquakes

114
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,312
is from another.

115
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,263
So you can view these as powers of 10.

116
00:06:57,263 --> 00:07:06,922
So if you take -- go from 5.8 to 7.0, that was 1.2 difference, but remember this is a logarithmic scale

117
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:08,919
and I encourage you to watch the videos we made

118
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:10,800
on the logarithmic scale.

119
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,026
On a logarithmic scale, a fixed distance is not a fixed amount of movement

120
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:17,557
or change on that scale

121
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:20,784
it's not kinda a fixed linear distance,

122
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:23,037
it's actually a scaling factor.

123
00:07:23,037 --> 00:07:25,382
And you're not scaling by 1.2 right over here.

124
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:27,634
You're scaling by 10 to the 1.2 power.

125
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:31,442
So this is times 10 to the 1.2 power.

126
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:36,899
Let me get my calculator right over here and let's figure

127
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:38,478
what that is.

128
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,196
So you can imagine what it's going to be:

129
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:42,379
10 to the first power is 10. An then you have .2.

130
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,396
So it's gonna be, let's do it.

131
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:52,247
10 to the 1.2 power. It's 15.8, so it's roughly 16 times stronger.

132
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:55,034
So whatever shaking there was just felt on the east cost

133
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:57,797
and maybe some of you watching this might have felt it.

134
00:07:57,797 --> 00:08:01,373
Loma Prieta earthquake was 16 times stronger.

135
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:08,107
Let me write this: it is 16 times stronger than the one

136
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:09,848
we've just had in the east cost.

137
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:11,265
So that's a dramatic difference.

138
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:13,099
Even though this caused some damage

139
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,650
and this kind of shaking on, you know, on a pretty good scale

140
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,388
imagine 16 times as much shaking and how much damage would that cause.

141
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:23,432
I've actually just met a reporter who told me that

142
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:25,591
she was in her backyard in the Loma Prieta earthquake

143
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:27,333
not too far from where I live now

144
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,724
and she says "all the cars were like jumping up and down"

145
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:32,511
so it was a massive earthquake.

146
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,438
Now let's think about the japanese earthquake.

147
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:36,667
We could think about how much stronger was it than Loma Prieta?

148
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,059
So remember: you don't just think of this as:

149
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,913
"oh, it's just you know - this is just 2 times stronger".

150
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:45,235
It's 10 to the second times stronger

151
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,047
and we know how to figure that out.

152
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:48,834
10 to the second power is a 100.

153
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:52,248
So this right over here, so cars were jumping up and down at Loma Prieta earthquake.

154
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:59,957
The japanese earthquake was 100 times stronger than Loma Prieta.

155
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,650
And if you compare to the East Cost earthquake

156
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:09,222
it'd be 16 00 times the East Cost earthquake that occured

157
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:11,079
in August of 2011.

158
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,680
So massive earthquake.

159
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,770
And just to get a sense of how much stronger

160
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,906
the chilean earthquake was at 1960...

161
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:21,551
and there are some fascinating outcomes of the japanese earthquake.

162
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:24,802
It was estimated that Japan over the course of earthquake

163
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:29,028
got 13 feet wider.

164
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:35,808
So this is doing something to the actual shape of a huge island

165
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,361
and of top of that it's estimated that because of the shaking

166
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,449
and the distortions in Earth caused by that shaking

167
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:46,490
That the day on Earth got one milionth of a second shorter.

168
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,603
Little over milionth of the second shorter.

169
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:50,437
So you might say: "hey it's only milionth of a second".

170
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:53,479
But I say, hey look! It actually changed the day of the Earth,

171
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,545
the very fundamental thing and it actually matter

172
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:58,425
when people send thing to space and probes into Mars

173
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:02,326
that they're able to know that our day just got milionth of a second shorter.

174
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:05,298
So this was already a massive quake

175
00:10:05,298 --> 00:10:09,826
and the chilean earthquake is going to be 10 to the 0.5 times stronger

176
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,985
than that. So let's get out calculator out.

177
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:14,307
So you can really view it as a square root of 10.

178
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:17,604
So 10 to the 0.5 is the same thing as 10 to the one half.

179
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:21,273
Which is the same thing as square root of 10.

180
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:23,154
Which is 3.16.

181
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:28,262
So the strongest earthquake on record was 3.16 times stronger

182
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:30,399
than the japanese earthquake

183
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,326
the one that shortened the day of the planet

184
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:35,530
the one that made Japan 13 feet wider.

185
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:40,592
And so this was, if you want to compare it to the East Cost earthquake

186
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:46,281
this would be almost or about 5000 times stronger,

187
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:48,115
so massive earthquake.

188
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:51,714
So one: hopefuly that gives you a sense of what Richter scale

189
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:54,036
is all about and also gives you sense of how massive

190
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:56,080
some of these supermassive earthquakes are.

191
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,657
And you can also appreciate what Charles Richter first problem was.

192
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:01,072
If you want to plot all of these on the same linear plot

193
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:07,249
you'd have to stick this one - 5000 further along an axis

194
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,106
than you would have to stick this one.

195
00:11:09,106 --> 00:11:12,705
And this one itself it's still a pretty big earthquake

196
00:11:12,705 --> 99:59:59,999
so this would have to be 5000 times further than some of the earthquakes
