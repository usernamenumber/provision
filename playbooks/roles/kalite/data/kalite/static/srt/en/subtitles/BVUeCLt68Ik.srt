1
00:00:01,737 --> 00:00:07,369
The body has a really really cool way 
of controlling blood pressure.

2
00:00:07,369 --> 00:00:11,137
You'll hear about this RAAS-system.

3
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:19,404
RAAS stands for Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System.

4
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:24,112
Let's go through this RAAS-system, 
kind of like an overview.

5
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:31,070
Just looking at where things start from 
and where things go in terms of cells and hormones.

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,940
Those are the two things I want to distinguish between.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,171
This RAAS-system begins with a set of cells.

8
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:43,335
I'm gonna draw all of my cells as little blue houses, like that.

9
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:49,469
The hormones they release are gonna be 
orange messengers.

10
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,737
I'm gonna draw a little messenger,
this will be a little person.

11
00:00:54,737 --> 00:01:00,277
The person is the hormone 
and the blue house is the cell.

12
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:10,968
The key cell in the RAAS-system is the juxtaglomerular cell.
The JG cell.

13
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:22,469
These JG cells are actually in the kidney,
but in a specific location, in the blood vessels.

14
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:31,882
If you look closely, these JG cells are nothing more 
than very special smooth muscle cells.

15
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:37,076
If you look in the blood vessels,
they're actually just like smooth muscle cells.

16
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:41,970
I'm gonna write smooth muscle, 
just to remind you where they are.

17
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,136
Of course these are in the kidney.

18
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:49,577
It may not look like a kidney,
but that's what it's supposed to be.

19
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:54,009
The JG cells are releasing a hormone called renin.

20
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,548
When would they do that?

21
00:01:55,548 --> 00:02:02,476
Renin is gonna help us raise blood pressure.

22
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:08,133
If the juxtaglomerular cells, these little guys, 
notice the blood pressure is low,

23
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:12,284
that would be a trigger for releasing renin.

24
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:20,300
That's the first trigger, low blood pressure.

25
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,442
That's not the only trigger,
there are actually 3 triggers.

26
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:27,640
Let me write down 2 and 3.

27
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,010
Let's go through what they are.

28
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:38,705
The second trigger is a neighboring cell is actually 
a sympathetic nerve cell.

29
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:48,280
We know that sympathetic nerve cells, 
they fire whenever something big is going on.

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:56,669
For example you're running away from a bear, 
or let's say you're trying to win a fight,

31
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:00,505
or let's say you're in a car accident and you start bleeding.

32
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:07,469
Any sort of major stressor is gonna cause 
these nerve cells to start firing.

33
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,901
When they fire, that JG cell starts releasing renin.

34
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:16,052
So the second trigger would be the sympathetics.

35
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:21,469
The sympathetics, or maybe sympathetic nerves.

36
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:29,961
If these are your neighboring cells, these little sympathetic nerve cells, because they end right on the JG cells.

37
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:42,703
Then a little ways away, still in the kidney of course, 
not touching the JG cells, would be the macula densa cells.

38
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:47,303
Stay with me for this, 
these macula densa cells are also in the kidney

39
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:56,069
and actually they're specifically in the distal tubule of the nephron, so remember the distal convoluted tubule.

40
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:03,049
They're there, their interesting ability 
is the ability to sense sodium.

41
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:12,172
When you have low blood pressure,
not a lot of blood is moving through that glomerulus.

42
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:17,243
Not a lot of blood is moving through the nephron as a result.

43
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:20,892
A lot of the salt is being reabsorbed.

44
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:24,003
So by the time it gets to the distal convoluted tubule,

45
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:31,633
the macula densa cells, they're kind of tasting or sensing the fluid that goes by

46
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:34,071
and they say 'There's not a lot of salt here.'

47
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:39,557
They put 2 and 2 together and realize that the reason there's not a lot of salt, is that the blood pressure is low.

48
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:46,103
So when they don't sense much salt, 
they say 'Hey, JG cells, wake up!'

49
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:49,882
'Do something about this, raise blood pressure for us.'

50
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:54,811
They send a message over in the form of prostaglandins.

51
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:58,736
Prostaglandins are local messengers.

52
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:03,911
Unlike renin, which is more of a long distance messenger,
prostaglandins act locally.

53
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:10,399
Actually, lots and lots of cells in our body 
use prostaglandins to send local messages.

54
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:22,025
The third trigger, just to summarize it,
is low salt in the distal convoluted tubule.

55
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:30,598
You know specifically that it's the macula densa cells of the convoluted tubule.

56
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:35,896
So these are the three major triggers for renin release.

57
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:38,298
This is all happening in the kidney.

58
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:41,361
That's were all this action is occurring.

59
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:46,794
But you know there are other organs 
involved in blood pressure control as well.

60
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:52,133
The one that is next on our list, is the liver cells.

61
00:05:52,133 --> 00:06:02,191
The liver cells, here we go, a little house for cells,
are also making a hormone of their own.

62
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:08,793
It's gonna meet up with renin in a second
and it's called angiotensinogen.

63
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:20,897
Angiotensinogen is kind of a sleepwalker, 
if we would zoom in on its face, it would be asleep.

64
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:23,664
So I'm gonna draw it that way.

65
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:30,438
It's there and it's moving around the body,
but it's not active and that's the key thing, it's not active.

66
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:39,564
But it needs renin and renin literally 
chops of a big chunk of angiotensinogen.

67
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:41,861
And if that doesn't wake you up, I don't know what would.

68
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:51,684
Angiotensinogen becomes angiotensin I after meeting renin.

69
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:59,868
So renin is an enzyme that cuts a big chunk 
of this angiotensinogen protein away.

70
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:08,432
Angiotensin I is the result.
If you'd zoom in on this guys face, it would be awake.

71
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:11,641
Maybe even a little smile.

72
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:22,440
Angiotensin I now floats through blood vessels 
and of course blood vessels have cells lining them.

73
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,161
So let's draw a little house.

74
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:35,028
These are the endothelial cells.
These are the cells that are lining the blood vessel inside.

75
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:39,027
Classically we used to think that 
this is almost always happening in the lungs,

76
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:47,061
but more and more we're realizing that it definitely does happen in the lungs, but it's in other vessels as well.

77
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:51,595
Endothelial cells in a number of parts of our body, 
including the lungs,

78
00:07:51,595 --> 00:08:00,461
are able to convert angiotensin I into angiotensin II.

79
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:06,503
So angiotensin II is formed.

80
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:11,562
This is also a hormone, so I'll draw this little person.

81
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:18,775
Angiotensin II is happy as a clown, 
because angiotensin II has lots of activity.

82
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:21,892
It's a very very active hormone,
it does all sorts of things.

83
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:23,961
I'm gonna draw that activity now.

84
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:29,268
Angiotensin II will go out to a number of different places.

85
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm gonna draw four arrows, 
1, 2 and two little ones, 3 and 4.

86
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:45,966
It goes to four places and four different cell types are affected by angiotensin II.

87
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:52,602
Keep in mind, at the beginning of all this,
we're trying to raise blood pressure.

88
00:08:52,602 --> 00:09:00,093
Four different cell types are affected
and here is the fourth.

89
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:08,754
The first one over here is smooth 
muscle cells in the blood vessels.

90
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,804
This is smooth muscle cells all over the body, 
not just in the kidney.

91
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:21,509
These smooth muscle cells all over the body are 
going to contract, they're gonna constrict down.

92
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:24,564
They're gonna cause increased resistance.

93
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:32,733
Remember that as the blood vessels constrict, 
vasoconstrict, that will increase resistance.

94
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,797
That's one effect.

95
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:45,176
In a different cell type all together, in the kidney cells,
you actually have the ability to,

96
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:50,095
angiotensin II makes these kidney cells hold on to more water.

97
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:53,253
So you have more volume.

98
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:58,861
It helps the kidney to hold on to more water and more volume.

99
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:03,194
Think about it in terms of stroke volume.
It's gonna increase stroke volume.

100
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:09,101
So you have increased resistance
and now increased stroke volume.

101
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:13,261
Those are two cell types for angiotensin II to act on.

102
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:17,761
It also acts on a couple of glands.

103
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:21,577
I'm gonna try to draw for you the pituitary gland.

104
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:28,095
This pituitary gland is sitting at the base of the brain.

105
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:38,234
This gland is called that because it secretes hormones as well, actually it's sending out messengers as well.

106
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:44,260
Here's a little hormone, again in orange,
remember all our hormones are in orange.

107
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,418
This one is called ADH.
AntiDiuretic Hormone.

108
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:58,231
That ADH does some of the same stuff, 
at the end of the day, that angiotensin II will do.

109
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:01,761
In that it will increase resistance of blood vessels

110
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:08,003
and it will also increase volume by making the kidney hold on to more water.

111
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:13,626
The fourth cell type, is gonna be the adrenal gland.

112
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:16,502
The adrenal gland is here.

113
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:25,337
It's called ad-renal because it's sitting on top of the kidney, which is the renal.

114
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:30,928
This adrenal gland is also making a hormone,
because it's a gland.

115
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:34,081
That hormone is going to act right there.

116
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:42,028
This is the little messenger 
and this is called aldosterone.

117
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:51,367
So you've got aldosterone and ADH that are
also acting on some of the same cells.

118
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:57,397
I should rephrase that, not on the same cells, 
but on the same organs as the angiotensin II.

119
00:11:57,397 --> 00:12:03,137
So here aldosterone is gonna act 
on kidney cells to increase volume.

120
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:07,802
ADH is gonna act on, like I said before,
the kidney and smooth muscle.

121
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:15,297
So let's scroll up and show you from the top some interesting things I want to point out.

122
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:22,038
We've got at the very top, all the action, 
you remember, started in the kidneys.

123
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:30,792
It started in the kidney with the macula densa cell and our JG cell and even our nerve endings were in the kidneys.

124
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:36,560
One of the key target organs down 
here is of course the kidney.

125
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,961
Things are starting in the kidney,
but they're also ending in the kidney.

126
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,196
Then you'll say 
'Well what about the smooth muscle cells all over the body?'

127
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:50,663
You're absolutely right it does also affects 
the smooth muscle in other parts of the body.

128
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:53,924
I just want to point out the fact that 
the kidney is a major player in this game.

129
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:55,891
That's one point.

130
00:12:55,891 --> 00:13:04,594
The other point is that when people talk about the RAAS-system, they're talking about certain pathways.

131
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:09,961
They're specifically talking about, for example, 
this arrow right here, this hormone obviously.

132
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:15,563
They're talking about this angiotensinogen 
and this angiotensin I.

133
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:20,434
They're also referring to angiotensin II and all of its targets.

134
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:27,226
They're gonna talk about angiotensin II affecting 
the smooth muscle and the two glands,

135
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:32,760
the pituitary as well as the adrenal gland 
and its effect on the kidney.

136
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,527
So they're really referring to all of those things.

137
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:43,464
I want to make sure you remember that it's affecting four, 
at least four target cell types.

138
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:50,828
Finally that aldosterone right here has 
a huge effect on the kidney as well.

139
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:54,832
These are the important points 
to take away from this overview,

140
00:13:54,832 --> 00:14:01,233
that there are many different hormones involved, 
and I've tried to keep them color-coded all in orange,

141
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,566
to make sure we keep track of them.

142
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:07,566
And the fact that the kidney is 
a major player in blood pressure control.
