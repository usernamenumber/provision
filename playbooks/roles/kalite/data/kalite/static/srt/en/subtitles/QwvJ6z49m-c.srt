1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,155
In the last video, we gave a basic outline of the different scenarios that might play out in 2013

2
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:09,023
or at least the different budgetary proposals on the table

3
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:11,628
from the administration, from the Republicans

4
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:14,144
and what will happen if they don't come to an agreement

5
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:15,620
which is the Fiscal Cliff

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,422
which is this fairly unusual situation where

7
00:00:18,422 --> 00:00:21,674
the both parties to the negotiations set up this thing

8
00:00:21,674 --> 00:00:24,751
that will automatically happen in the beginning of 2013

9
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:27,006
then it would be painful for both parties

10
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:33,182
and the thinking being, that it will maybe force them into some type of agreement sooner than later

11
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:36,705
The fiscal cliff is something neither the Republicans or the administration want

12
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:40,177
because it raises taxes, which the Republicans don't want

13
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:43,755
and it reduces spending, which the president doesn't want

14
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:48,586
and the core argument, and we touched it on the last video and we'll go in more depth in this one is,

15
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:52,561
just as we are beginning to recover our last recession

16
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:57,338
it might not be useful for our economy to suck out half a trillion dollars

17
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:01,795
so let's think about the different issues at play

18
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:07,779
so right over here- let's have some charts, most of these are from the congressional budget office

19
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:10,020
and there are a bunch of assumptions that go into this

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,620
and people will debate the assumptions that they make

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,911
but they at least directionally show the right things

22
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,622
So this right over here, this first chart

23
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:22,724
is... compares deficits or surpluses

24
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:26,771
and really ever since 2000s, we've been running deficits

25
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:35,485
as we got into the late, I guess, 10s, or 2008, 2010 time frame, 2009 time frame

26
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:37,152
as we went into a financial crisis

27
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:41,941
When the economy contracts, you get hit in two ways

28
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:43,896
when you think about deficit and spending

29
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,355
On one end, you bring in less revenue

30
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:47,581
the economy is shrinking

31
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,227
on the other end, you have to spend more

32
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:50,533
you have to give people more benefits

33
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:52,109
more unemployment benefits, things like that

34
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,166
so whenever you see the economy shrink,

35
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:58,947
you will see naturally, (all other things being equal,)

36
00:01:58,947 --> 00:02:01,418
you will see deficit increase

37
00:02:01,418 --> 00:02:02,733
and that's what we saw right over here

38
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:05,362
and on top of that, the government is trying to bail things out

39
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:07,197
is putting stimulus spending and all that

40
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:09,548
in order to minimize the effect of the deficit

41
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:12,675
and that's why you see here, in 2008, 2009

42
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:15,415
we started running significant, significant deficits.

43
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:21,243
Now, what's interesting, is what's going to happen going foward.

44
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:24,633
In going forward, there's two of these scenarios right here

45
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:28,593
There is the CVO's baseline projection

46
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:31,773
and then there's the alternative fiscal scenario

47
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:33,545
and just to be clear where we are

48
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:37,015
We are entering this phase, right over here

49
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:39,846
in 2013

50
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:45,685
and the baseline projection, is essentially if the government takes no more action

51
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:50,847
And if the government takes no more action, then the fiscal cliff will be triggered.

52
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:56,119
We will essentially have 500 billion less in 2013's deficit

53
00:02:56,119 --> 00:03:00,054
and so what you see here is the deficits go down dramatically

54
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,370
go down dramatically

55
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,472
we have to borrow less on an anunal basis.

56
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:09,828
Now the alternative fiscal scenario

57
00:03:09,828 --> 00:03:12,860
is if the- is if we essentially continue-

58
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,431
if we extend our existing spending,

59
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:19,478
and if we continue to extend Bush era tax cuts,

60
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:21,689
we go along this path.

61
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:23,881
And so if you care a lot about deficits,

62
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:27,028
the fiscal cliff scenario, which is this top line,

63
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,251
this is actually the fiscal-

64
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,925
let me write that in a color you can see-

65
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:33,404
that's actually the fiscal cliff scenario

66
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:34,766
and actually looks pretty good

67
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:38,301
Hey, look! We have much much lower deficits in that scenario

68
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:43,372
than if we were to continue the tax cuts

69
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,821
and than if we were to continue the spending

70
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:48,955
So there, that looks like an argument FOR the fiscal cliff.

71
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:53,959
Now, let's look at this, now this is where we're going to talk about the "aggregate debt"

72
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,063
When we say deficit, we're talking about the shortfall in a given year.

73
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:01,607
The debt is the aggregate amount that the government owes

74
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:04,222
so this is federal debt held by the public

75
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:08,468
historically and as predicted in CBO's baseline

76
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:10,584
and what a lot of what CBO, when they project,

77
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,620
they can only do so much in projecting

78
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,243
how good the economy might be, or how bad it might be,

79
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:18,385
to a large degree, they extrapolate from where we are right now

80
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:23,056
And right over here, you see debt as a percentage of GDP

81
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:27,323
so you can imagine during World War II, we had a lot of debt as a percentage of GDP

82
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:30,664
see over here after the end of World War II

83
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:34,403
we started crossing over 100% of GDP is our debt-

84
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:36,388
the aggregate amount that the government owes

85
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:41,234
and then it de-levered, then you see this rough trend,

86
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:49,678
roughly from the early 80s, until now, where we had increasing aggregate debt

87
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:55,765
There was, there were some moments in the late 90s, early 2000s where we took it down

88
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:59,339
very very strong economy, we started running surpluses,

89
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,255
we started to pay down some of our debt

90
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:04,936
but then we kind of hit back on this debt increasing trend-line

91
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:10,402
And once again, if we continue, in the alternative fiscal scenario

92
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:12,157
which is really continue to do what we do today

93
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:17,137
which is extend the tax cuts, and continue to have roughly the same level spending

94
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:20,796
you see that the debt only continues to increase

95
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:23,118
only continues to increase

96
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:26,557
In the baseline projection- this is actually the fiscal cliff scenario

97
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:28,924
This is where no new legislation is passes

98
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:32,848
Those triggers, in which the Bush era tax cuts expire

99
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:38,690
and the spending cuts that are triggered by the fiscal cliff scenario hit

100
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,558
we run lower deficits, and and we actually see the debt,

101
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:46,241
as a percentage of GDP, actually starts to go down,

102
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:49,973
which is, at least from a balance sheet perspective,

103
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:51,509
seems like a good thing.

104
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:52,601
So these fist two charts say,

105
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,541
Hey! Well, maybe this fiscal cliff thing isn't so bad.

106
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:59,643
The, well, actually will significantly lower the deficit on an annual basis,

107
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:04,791
and as a percentage of GDP, we will, as a country, de-lever.

108
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,939
Now let's think of the arguments why,

109
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:09,083
well, maybe we don't want to be that aggressive

110
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,406
when it come to reducing our deficit

111
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:15,457
or reducing our debt as a percentage of GDP

112
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:17,721
This first chart, right over here,

113
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,575
is the- let me write over here-

114
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:25,433
is the percent of our population that is employed.

115
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:29,187
and you see right- and so its a proxy for employment or unemployment

116
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,476
or in this case it's employment

117
00:06:30,476 --> 00:06:35,541
and you see we hit a major recession at the end of 2008

118
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:40,052
We saw the percent of our population that is employed go down dramatically

119
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:42,140
we kind of hit bottom over here,

120
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,404
and we're having kind of a shaky, hopefully a shaky recovery

121
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:49,647
right now it's not even clear how good that will be

122
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:52,474
but hopefully we're having a shaky recovery of sorts

123
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:55,391
and so just as we're starting to recover,

124
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:57,952
it might not be helpful to take,

125
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:02,398
essentially 500 billion dollars out of the economy

126
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:04,837
in order to pay down debt

127
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:08,353
so the fiscal cliff scenario might make us go back

128
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:11,301
into a little bit of a lurch

129
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:16,858
and most economists are projecting about, on the order of, a percent slower growth

130
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:19,657
if the fiscal cliff scenario were to hit

131
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:22,825
Actually, most economists- not a percent.

132
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:26,375
They're actually expecting a two percent hit to the economy

133
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,979
if the fiscal cliff scenario would happen

134
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,357
and rather from 1.7 percent growth,

135
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:38,800
we might go to negative, a slight recession- slight receding of the economy

136
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,153
so that could be, that's obviously not a good scenario that we want to be in

137
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:44,791
The other chart that I have right over here,

138
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,017
these are yields on ten-year treasury notes

139
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:50,667
this seems like a very technical thing to talk about

140
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,323
but this is essentially the interest,

141
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:57,206
one way to think about it is the interest that the government is paying when it is borrowing money for ten years

142
00:07:57,206 --> 00:08:01,821
And one of the main arguments for paying down debt

143
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,892
is that if the government keeps borrowing money

144
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:07,479
it's going to crowd out other borrowers

145
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,016
it's going to make demand for money high

146
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:12,599
and maybe the supply will become more and more scarce

147
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,820
and interest rates will go up

148
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,901
so a lot of borrowing can make interest rates go up

149
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:23,854
and the other idea is, well, it there's a lot of just borrowing and spending going on

150
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:27,058
and if we don't have a lot of productive capacity,

151
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:28,968
it could also lead to inflation

152
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:31,392
or maybe when the government has a huge debt

153
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:36,388
they have an incentive to try to have inflationary policies

154
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:39,050
so that in real terms, that debt seems to be less

155
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,172
But when you look at the debt markets,

156
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:43,869
these are market driven numbers-

157
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:46,660
the federal government does not control ten-year yields-

158
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,056
(the federal reserve controls short-term yields)

159
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:53,653
you see that we have historically low interest rates

160
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:58,422
so the bond market, there are some very smart people

161
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:02,117
who are living or make their living investing in the bond markets

162
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:04,244
one of the biggest markets if not the biggest

163
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,000
It's saying that its not worried about deficits

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,767
it's willing to lend to the US government at all time low interest rates

165
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,292
it's not expecting any inflation

166
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:19,189
if anything, the bond market is saying that the biggest risk in the economy is continued sluggish growth

167
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:23,815
the biggest risk in the economy is maybe even some form of deflation

168
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:28,685
So this super-low bond yield right over here would be an argument,

169
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,719
that yeah, if you believe what the bond market is saying

170
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:35,214
we, one definitely should not suck money out of the economy

171
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:39,429
and the risks of maintaining high levels of debt

172
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:42,258
might not be as high as some people are saying

173
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:46,976
that you're not going to see interest rates and inflation go through the roof tomorrow

174
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:51,200
Now, if you ascribe to the second point of view that

175
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,206
ok, yes, we should be responsible, we should start to lower-

176
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:56,340
at least minimum lower our deficit

177
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,566
and over time, as a percentage of GDP, lower our debt,

178
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,979
the other question is, "How do you do that?"

179
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:05,430
The Republicans would want to do it mainly through spending cuts

180
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,272
while the Democrats want to do that possibly through spending cuts

181
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:13,291
but also by maintaining some of the tax,

182
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,674
or letting some of that tax cuts on the wealthy expire

183
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:17,394
and maybe even adding some other tax.

184
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:20,436
And so these two charts inform some of those positions,

185
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:23,873
and I'm trying to give as balanced of an approach as I can.

186
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:28,503
So, for a Democrat, they might look at this chart right over here and they might say

187
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:32,578
Well, look! Average tax rates for the highest income tax payers-

188
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:34,962
if you look at it on a historical basis

189
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:38,730
It looks like it is relatively low,

190
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,525
and a lot of this comes from the idea

191
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:43,419
that even though the marginal tax rates are higher than what you see here

192
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:47,491
High income tax-payers, a lot of their income might be from capital gains,

193
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:50,607
from dividends, those are taxed at 15%

194
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:54,207
They also might have a more sophisticated accountants

195
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:55,622
who can get them more deductions

196
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,719
and that's why you have them paying-

197
00:10:57,719 --> 00:11:00,056
and they're getting more sophisticated as time goes by

198
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:04,006
and that's why you see this trend going down

199
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:08,251
and so this could be an argument, at least relative to historic basis

200
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:12,305
that this category folks might be able to afford to pay more

201
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,922
There's also another argument in terms of, kind of a stimulus arguement

202
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,974
or how to minimize the impact on the economy

203
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:21,626
that, if you were to give-

204
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:26,765
so if you have a dollar, you want to somehow stimulate the economy with

205
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:30,091
well one, the government would spend the money,

206
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:32,851
and there're many arguments, there're many good arguments

207
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,787
why the government is not always the most efficient spender of money

208
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:37,068
and not always spending it in the best way

209
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,907
but they will definitely spend it

210
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,889
so you give it to the government, they'll definitely spend it and then some.

211
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:45,041
So the'll definitely spend the dollar

212
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,372
at least it will enter into the economy.

213
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:52,736
now, if you give it to the middle class,

214
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:54,656
they are also likely to spend it

215
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:57,048
or to spend a good chunk of it, maybe save a little bit

216
00:11:57,048 --> 00:12:00,650
and the argument would be that if you give it to someone who's affluent

217
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,617
If you give to someone affluent, they're likely to save it.

218
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:08,935
Now, saving is not always a bad thing.

219
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:13,129
If you are low on investment, you need more savers.

220
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:17,817
If interest rates were going through the roof right over here,

221
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,605
that means that we need- we don't have enough supply of money.

222
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:23,933
In which case, it makes sense that we would try to incent savers.

223
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:25,506
So if you have a situation of-

224
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:29,163
In the late 70s, where you had inflation going through the roof

225
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:31,764
You want people to actually invest more

226
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,900
you want to higher supply of money

227
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:40,398
makes complete sense to put more money in hands of people who are likely to save and invest that money.

228
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:42,967
And here, at least if you believe the bond market,

229
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,307
it looks like we have a demand problem

230
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,558
its very cheap to get capital

231
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,964
if anything, there's a surplus of capital out there

232
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:53,094
but there's not enough demand in order for people to-

233
00:12:53,094 --> 00:12:57,214
I guess the economy to run at its potential.

234
00:12:57,214 --> 00:13:00,034
So a Democratic argument would be, look:

235
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:04,206
If we're going to have this dollar,

236
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:07,930
the person we're best off giving it to is the middle class

237
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,897
or, possibly to some degree, the government

238
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:12,117
because at least they will be spend it

239
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:13,439
It will help stimulate the economy.

240
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:18,613
Here, it would go into savings, but that doesn't seem like what the government needs right now.

241
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:22,350
Now, the counter argument, that you might get from someone at the right,

242
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,058
is that, first, the government is just hugely inefficient spender of capital

243
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:28,735
and there's a lot of evidence to-

244
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:32,422
you definitely need a government, but they don't always spend the money in the most efficient

245
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:35,469
and even, sometimes it leads to levels of corruption

246
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:39,323
and often times, when you do something in the name of stimulus

247
00:13:39,323 --> 00:13:42,794
maybe it might make sense to do in the short term,

248
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:44,568
but once that program is in place,

249
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:46,704
it's very hard to remove that program.

250
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:49,190
People start to depend on it, even when you-

251
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,340
when in theory, you don't need the stimulus anymore

252
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,418
it's very hard to shrink the size of government.

253
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,467
And so, there's some argument for that,

254
00:13:57,467 --> 00:14:01,824
if you look at outlays- government expenditure as a percentage of GDP,

255
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:05,384
it does look like- on a historical basis, it is high.

256
00:14:05,384 --> 00:14:12,534
Now, to some degree, this is due to the fact that we have entered into kind of a major recessionary phase

257
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:14,154
we see that in all the major recessions

258
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,991
In all the major recessions, the government gets less revenue

259
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:22,668
so the government gets less revenue, and has to do more outlays

260
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:27,106
This happens in every- this happens- well, I would have to say, in most recessions

261
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:28,700
and this happened in dramatic form

262
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,203
where we started to have more outlays,

263
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:35,203
we had, actually at this point we had wars that we were funding

264
00:14:35,203 --> 00:14:39,763
and we were doing these trillion-dollar stimulus packages

265
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:43,334
and we had these trillion-dollar bailouts at the same time that the economy was

266
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:46,254
the economy was receding right over here

267
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:50,032
But just, when you look at this, it does look like the government spending,

268
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:53,385
as a percentage of GDP, is at historical highs.

269
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:56,462
And as we say, and, you know, as the argument would have it,

270
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,685
it's very hard to get that to shrink even when it should be shrinking

271
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:04,422
and it's often being deployed in less than efficient ways

272
00:15:04,422 --> 00:15:07,367
So I will leave you there

273
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:10,112
My intent is really not to sway you in one way or the other

274
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:13,245
but to really to just hope you have good information

275
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,763
when you think about the issues surrounding

276
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:19,763
the Fiscal Cliff.
