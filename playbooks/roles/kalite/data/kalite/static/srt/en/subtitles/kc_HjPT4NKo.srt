1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:06,893
During normal times in the economy, the Fed tries to control the amount of economic activity that's occuring

2
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:12,193
by targeting the federal funds rate--the fed funds rate.

3
00:00:12,193 --> 00:00:15,706
And this is the rate that you always hear talked about on the news,

4
00:00:15,706 --> 00:00:20,443
and it's essentially a target rate that the Fed wants to see banks lending money,

5
00:00:20,443 --> 00:00:24,249
lending cash to each other on an overnight basis.

6
00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:29,169
And we saw already in the last video, if the Fed does not like the rate that they're borrowing to each other,

7
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:33,864
and if even announcing the federal funds rate doesn't cause the banks to say,

8
00:00:33,864 --> 00:00:37,067
"Hey, the Fed's going to intervene if we don't lend to each other at that rate,"

9
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,848
the Fed can actually intervene.

10
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:45,037
It can go out there, perform open market operations, and buy, usually, Treasury securities

11
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:51,826
out from the general market, and what that does is it increases the amount of cash that is in circulation.

12
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:58,658
which decreases the demand for cash, increases the supply, and it should lower the interest rate.

13
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:03,228
And the Fed usually cares about getting that interest rate within a certain zone,

14
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:05,333
around a certain target.

15
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:09,562
And the Treasuries that the Fed normally buys are short-term Treasuries.

16
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:14,220
And this is just because this is less risky, and sometimes they'll even make it on a temporary agreement.

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,152
They'll say, "Look, we'll buy it from you now, only if you agree to purchase it

18
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:20,166
at some future date at a certain price."

19
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:24,497
And that's called a repurchase agreement. I'll do a whole other video on that.

20
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:30,041
But the whole point of open market operations is to set this overnight borrowing rate.

21
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:35,289
But they usually deal with the short-term Treasury debt because it's safer.

22
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:38,586
It exposes the Fed to less interest rate risk.

23
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:42,657
But you can imagine what happens if the Fed keeps lowering interest rates

24
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:47,640
in order to kind of prime the pump, in order to kind of try to stimulate the economy.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,190
So it keeps lowering the federal funds rate from 4% down to 3%, down to 2%,

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,487
maybe going all the way down, eventually to 0%.

27
00:01:57,487 --> 00:02:01,923
And the whole time, it's been doing that by printing money and buying short-term US securities.

28
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:06,063
And maybe, at this point, the yield curve looks like that.

29
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:08,929
But maybe that's not enough. Maybe the economy is still tanking.

30
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,309
Maybe people aren't getting mortgage loans still.

31
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:16,867
So now the Fed can no longer do its traditional open market operations, and it will no longer be focused

32
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:22,441
on just the federal funds rate, because really it can't go any lower. It already hit zero.

33
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:26,742
Short-term, overnight borrowing between banks is already zero.

34
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:31,575
But if the Fed wants to inject more cash, it can now buy different types of securities.

35
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:36,002
It can buy Treasury securities, so instead of short-term Treasury securities,

36
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,886
maybe it could be longer-term Treasury securities.

37
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:42,571
So maybe stuff that's one year out, five years out, ten years out.

38
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:49,010
And the point here would be twofold. One would be to inject cash into the system,

39
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,910
to print cash and put it out there so it's there for people to invest and for the banking system to operate.

40
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,486
But it might be to explicitly control the yield curve further out,

41
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:03,771
so that the borrowing cost for longer debt goes down, so that the yield curve looks something like that.

42
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:09,577
Because if it's buying longer-maturity Treasuries, that will lower the yield.

43
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:12,845
Or they might even start to buy things that aren't Treasuries.

44
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:17,905
Maybe they'll buy mortgage-backed securities, so it makes the mortgage market a little bit looser,

45
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,376
a little bit more liquid.

46
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:25,212
And this non-traditional type of intervention, where the Fed is no longer concerned about a target rate,

47
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:27,163
because the target rate is already at zero,

48
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:31,877
where the Fed is not purchasing short-term debt, but is trying to buy longer-term debt,

49
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:36,606
things further down the yield curve, and maybe things that aren't Treasury securities to begin with,

50
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:42,238
maybe they're starting to buy corporate debt, maybe they're starting to buy mortgage-backed securities,

51
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:47,456
this is called quantitative easing--quantitative easing.

52
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:52,672
And there's two elements to it that make it different from traditional Fed open-market operations.

53
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:57,704
They are now no longer concerned about the fed fund rate, because it's already at zero.

54
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:02,176
The other thing is that they're buying things maybe further down the yield curve,

55
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,671
so they're trying to control the yield curve itself,

56
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:08,662
and they're maybe buying less traditional securities

57
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:14,236
with the goal of maybe making those markets a little bit more operational.
