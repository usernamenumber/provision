1
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:04,507
We're in the Musee de Louvre and we're looking at

2
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:07,897
Jacques-Louis David's "Brutus and his Sons".

3
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:10,590
This is one of my favourite paintings by David

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,420
and dates to the very year of the Revolution itself 1789.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,414
And it was tied beautifully to 
the revolutionary sentiment in subject.

6
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:25,730
Brutus has led the revolution against 
the kings in Rome, this is an Anient Rome.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,470
Brutus has discovered that 
his sons have commited treason

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,231
in attempting to restore the monarchy throne.

9
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:33,810
So Brutus has judged,

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,225
has taken the extraordinary step of

11
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:40,405
sentencing his own family to death for their treason.

12
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:44,398
Putting the state above his own personal family,

13
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:47,603
above his own feelings, above his own needs.

14
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:50,668
And that's the theme that 
we also see in "Oath of the Horatii".

15
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:54,755
The triumph of reason,of being morrow and virtuous

16
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:58,841
over personal feelings and personal priorities.

17
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,256
But this is also a painting about the cost of that.

18
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:07,061
It's not blind patriotism, there is a true,
emotional power and cost there, and it's tragic.

19
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:11,287
Brutus sits in shadow, under a statue of Rome,

20
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:13,888
holding his edict in his hand.

21
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:17,835
His feet crossed beneath him, his hand up,

22
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:22,247
he's obviously in thought, 
he is back turned to the body of his son

23
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:25,173
to be seen being carried in behind him,

24
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:30,420
while his wife and children 
who form the other half of the composition

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,736
call out fully illuminated, 
shielding their eyes, passing out.

26
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:39,987
They cant't believe what Brutus has done.

27
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:43,145
Brutus is quiet, he's calm, he's resigned,

28
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,581
even if there's a kind of deep tragedy there,

29
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:50,064
the woman on the other side 
and the children have given into their emotions.

30
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:54,755
In many ways this fits in with 
ideas that were around during the Revolution

31
00:01:54,755 --> 00:02:00,328
that only men really have 
the capability of sacrificing for the state,

32
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,900
of being true citizens because 
only men could rise above their emotions

33
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,661
and their personal concerns
to think about these greater goods.

34
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:15,142
That stoicism seems to be echoed 
in a very architecure of this space.

35
00:02:15,142 --> 00:02:18,393
We have a fairly complex classical environment.

36
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:23,873
Door, columns the most pared down 
and this is the truest of Greek architecture.

37
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:28,145
But then that softened 
especially in the sphere of the women

38
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:30,885
in the that's drape of cloth, the soften material...

39
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:34,647
This is a painting that's clearly 
informed by David's research

40
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:37,898
into classical architecture, into classical furnisgings.

41
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:41,845
And the figures themselves resamble 
ancient Greek and Roman sculptures.

42
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:44,492
The way that the drapery clings to their bodies,

43
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:47,743
the importance of anatomy here is so clear,

44
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:51,830
of a clarity of space, of a clarity of line.

45
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,823
The colours are subdued but the light comes in

46
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:59,771
really strongly and illuminates these figures.

47
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,650
And we have dramatic powerful gestures,

48
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,947
and you're right, this is sacrifice and vitue

49
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:10,266
but simultaneously the terrible emotional cost of that

50
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:14,167
not just for Brutus' family, but for Brutus too.

51
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:18,997
And this is fascinating to me that 
this painting was made in very year of Revolution

52
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:24,616
because it seems to speak to 
the virtues that were requied for the Revolution.

53
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:28,047
The idea of sacrificing for the greater good,

54
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:34,695
the idea that the Revolution 
brings in ideals of equality before the law.

55
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:39,774
So that even that Brutus is the leader, 
he's not going to excuse his sons.

56
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:43,824
Tragically, the Revolution would 
returned against his own sons.

57
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,439
And this becomes almost 
the foreshadowing of what will happen.

58
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,038
In that case you have 
the excesses of Rob Spear and others.

59
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:56,960
Where the virtues that are expressed 
in this early painting by David are turned away from.

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,933
In some tragic way this painting does for shadow,

61
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:03,484
the collapse and failure of the Revolution.
