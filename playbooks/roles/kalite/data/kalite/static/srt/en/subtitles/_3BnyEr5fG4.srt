1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,130
Our question asks us, what
equation describes the growth

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,550
pattern of this sequence
of a block?

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,460
So we want to figure out, if I
know that x is equal to 10,

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,860
how many blocks am
I going to have?

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,240
So let's just look at
this pattern here.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,440
So our first term in our
sequence, or our first object,

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,360
or our first pattern of blocks
right here, we just have 1

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,350
block right there.

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,470
So let me write, the term--
write it up here --so I have

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,350
the term and, then I'll have
the number of blocks.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,830
   

13
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,520
So in our first term,
we had one block.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,780
And then our second term-- I'll
just write this down,

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,150
just so we have it --what
happened here?

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,940
So it looks just like our first
term, but we added a

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,545
column here of four blocks.

18
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:57,140
So it's like 1 plus
4 right there.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,500
So we're going to have five
blocks right there.

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,330
We added 4 to it.

21
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,850
Then in our third term
what happened?

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,269
What happened in
our third term?

23
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,650
Well it just looks just like the
second term, but we added

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,980
another column of four
blocks here.

25
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,170
Right?

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,450
We added this column
right there.

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,540
If you imagine they were being
added to the left-hand side of

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,660
the pattern.

29
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,030
So we added four more blocks.

30
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,930
We have nine blocks now.

31
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,020
We have nine blocks, so it looks
like each time we're

32
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,810
adding four blocks.

33
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,900
And on this fourth
term, same thing.

34
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,520
The third term is just
this right here.

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,250
This right here is what the
third term looked like, and

36
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,650
then we added another column
of four blocks right here.

37
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,570
So we added four more, so we're
going to have 13 blocks.

38
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,800
So our fourth term is 13.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,870
So let's see if we can come up
with a formula, either looking

40
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,020
at the graphics, or maybe
looking at the numbers

41
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,530
themselves.

42
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,675
So one way to think about it, so
we start off with-- So when

43
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:52,470
x is equal to 1, let's say that
x is equal to the term,

44
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,510
we add just this 1 there.

45
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,440
Then when x is equal to 2, we
added one column of four.

46
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,860
So this is when x is equal to 2,
we have one column of four.

47
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,690
Then when x is equal
to 3, we have two

48
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,520
columns of 4, right there.

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,390
And you could even say when x
is equal to 1, you had zero

50
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,270
columns, right?

51
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,300
We had no, nothing, no extra
columns of four blocks.

52
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,510
We didn't have any.

53
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,670
And then when x is equal to
4, we had three columns.

54
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,410
We had three columns there,
when x is equal to 4.

55
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,750
So what's the pattern here?

56
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,530
Or how can we express the number
of blocks we're going

57
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,920
to have, given the term
that we have?

58
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,800
Well, it looks like we're
always going to have one

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,010
block, so let me write
it this way.

60
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,550
If I write the number of
blocks-- let me write it this

61
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:49,650
way --it looks like
we're always going

62
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,050
to have one, right?

63
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,500
We have this one right here,
that one right there, that one

64
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,030
right there, that
one right there.

65
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,420
Looks like we always have one
plus a certain number of

66
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,710
columns of four, but how many
columns do we have?

67
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,120
When x is equal to 1, we have
no columns of four blocks.

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,740
When x is equal to 2,
we have one column.

69
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,330
When x is equal to 3,
we have two columns.

70
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,770
So when x is equal to anything,
it looks like we

71
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,300
have one less number
of columns.

72
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,740
So it's going to be
x minus 1, right?

73
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,360
When x is 2, x minus 1 is 1.

74
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,220
When x is 3, x minus 1, so this
right here is x minus 1.

75
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,950
x is 2, this is x minus 1.

76
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,670
This is x minus 1.

77
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,650
This is x minus 1, and x minus
1 will tell us the number of

78
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,990
columns we have, right?

79
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,180
Here we have one, two,
three columns.

80
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,150
Here we have one, two columns.

81
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,330
Here we only have one column.

82
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,780
Here we have zero columns.

83
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,010
So it even works for
the first term.

84
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,670
And in every one of these
columns, so this right here, x

85
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:57,600
minus 1 is the number of
columns, and then in each

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,430
column we have four blocks.

87
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,530
So it's the number of columns
times 4, right?

88
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,340
For each of these columns,
we have one column.

89
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,710
We have one, two, three,
four blocks.

90
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,590
So this is the equation that
describes the growth pattern.

91
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,400
So let me write this, let me
simplify this a little bit.

92
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,390
If I were to multiply 4 times x
minus 1, I get the number of

93
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,940
blocks being equal to
1 plus 4 times x.

94
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,960
I have to distribute it.

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,050
4 times x is 4x, and then
4 times negative

96
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,680
1 is negative 4.

97
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,980
So that's equal to the
number of blocks.

98
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,230
   

99
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,600
And we could simplify this.

100
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,690
We have a 1 and we have a minus
4, or I guess we're

101
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,420
subtracting 4 from it, so this
is going to be equal to 4x

102
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,250
minus 3 is the number of blocks
given our x term.

103
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,190
So if we're on term 50, it's
going to be 4 times 50, which

104
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,120
is 200 minus 3, which
is 197 blocks.

105
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,890
Now another way you could have
done it is you could have just

106
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,100
said, look, every time we're
adding 4, this is a linear

107
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,050
relationship, and you could
essentially find the slope of

108
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,370
the line that connects this,
but assume that our line is

109
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,560
only defined on integers.

110
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,520
And that might be a little bit
more complicated, but the way

111
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,330
that you think about it is,
every one, every time we added

112
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,930
a block, we added-- or every
time we added a term we added

113
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,660
four blocks.

114
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,180
So we could write it this way.

115
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,490
We could just write change--
so this the triangle right

116
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,520
here means change.

117
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:48,240
Delta means change in blocks
divided by change in x.

118
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,490
Now you might recognize this.

119
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,290
This is slope.

120
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,160
And if you don't worry, if slope
is a completely foreign

121
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,100
concept to you, you can just
do it the way we did it the

122
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,190
first part of this video.

123
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,180
And that's a completely
legitimate way, and hopefully

124
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,550
it will make some connections
between what slope is.

125
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,670
So what is the change in blocks
for a change in x.

126
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:11,050
So when we went from x going
from 1 to 2-- so our change in

127
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,350
x here would be 2 minus 1, we
increased by 1 --what was our

128
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,700
change in blocks?

129
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,580
It would be 4, or 5 minus 1.

130
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,740
It's 5 minus 1.

131
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,560
And what is this equal to?

132
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,330
This is equal to 4 over 1,
which is equal to 4.

133
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,710
Let me scroll over
a little bit.

134
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,380
So our change in blocks, or
change in x is 4, or our slope

135
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,890
is equal to 4.

136
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,920
So if you want to do this kind
of the setting up the equation

137
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,900
of a line way, you would say
that our equation-- If, well

138
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,460
let me write it.

139
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:54,130
Number of blocks are going to
be equal to 4 times the term

140
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,970
that we're dealing with,
the term in our

141
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,490
pattern, plus some constant.

142
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,260
This right here is the
equation of a line.

143
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,135
If it's completely foreign to
you, just do it the way we did

144
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:07,330
it earlier in the video.

145
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,370
And so, how do we solve
for this constant?

146
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,320
Well, we use one of
our terms here.

147
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,960
We know that when we had one--
In our first term we

148
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,700
only had one block.

149
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,750
So let's put that here.

150
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,760
So in our first term-- we're
going to have that b right

151
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,390
there --we only had one block.

152
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,830
So we have 1 is equal
to 4 plus b.

153
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,260
If you subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation, so you

154
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,240
subtract 4 from both sides,
what do you get?

155
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,360
On the left-hand side, 1 minus
4 is negative 3, and that's

156
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,260
equal to-- these 4's cancel
out --and and

157
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,030
that's equal to b.

158
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,970
So another way to get the
equation of a line, we have

159
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,910
just solved that b is
equal to negative 3.

160
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,960
We said how much do the number
of blocks change for a certain

161
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,660
change in x, which is a change
in the number blocks for a

162
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,680
change in x, we saw
it's always 4.

163
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,230
4 per change in x.

164
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,510
When x changes by 1,
we change by 4.

165
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,630
That gave us our slope.

166
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,535
And then to solve for-- If you
view this as a line, although

167
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:12,120
this is only defined
on integers, I

168
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,550
guess positive integers.

169
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,230
In this situation, you could
view this as a y-intercept.

170
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,520
To solve for this constant, we
just use one of our terms. You

171
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,320
could have used any of them.

172
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,540
We used 1 and 1.

173
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,680
You could use 3 and 9.

174
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,390
You could use anything.

175
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,980
We solved b is equal to negative
3, and so if you put

176
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,990
b back here, you get four x
minus 3, which is what we got

177
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,789
earlier in the video,
right there.

178
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,799
Hopefully you found that fun.
