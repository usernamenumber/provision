1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,640
So in the last couple of videos
we've been looking at

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,670
the balance sheet of what
I called Bank A.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,730
And we said it has
these assets.

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,230
And the asset in particular
we're going to focus on is

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,060
this $4 billion in residential
CDOs right here.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,250
But anyway, its total assets
were $26 billion, at least

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,000
it's telling us that its total
assets are $26 billion

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,980
according to its accounting
on its balance sheet.

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,900
Its liabilities are
$23 billion.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,610
And so if you just subtract the
$23 from the $26 billion,

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,310
you get a book value
of its equity.

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,560
If you believe all of the
numbers on the company's

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,640
balance sheet, the company
is worth $3 billion.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,150
That's what the shareholders
own.

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,470
They own this equity stake.

17
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,280
And if there are 500 million
shares, that's $6.00 for each

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,120
of those shares.

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,330
And in the last video we talked
about if the market is

20
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,790
actually trading at $12.00 a
share, if people exchanging

21
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,440
those shares between
themselves.

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,460
Remember, the secondary market,
the stock market, most

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,170
of that is between two people
who are unrelated to the

24
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,070
company, trading the
shares of stock.

25
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,780
It's not a transaction
with the company.

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,950
There are transactions every now
and then with the company,

27
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,910
and that's why the stock
price is important.

28
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,910
But for the most part what you
see every day when you get a

29
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,290
quote is just the transaction
between two

30
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,470
unaffiliated parties.

31
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,790
It could be between
me and you.

32
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,800
I have my E-Trade account, you
have your Charles Schwab

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,130
account, we just traded
the stock.

34
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,220
For that second, we set the
price for whatever, the

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,180
value of bank A.

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,295
So I said if the value the
market is placing on a share

37
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:32,640
is $12.00 per share, that's
a $6 billion market cap.

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,950
The market, at least for that
moment, or at least the person

39
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,410
who just transacted or just
traded those shares, is saying

40
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,760
that, no I don't think that
this company only has $3

41
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,800
billion of equity, it actually
has $6 billion of equity.

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,220
And it might be because they
have some kind of great brand,

43
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,900
the equivalent of charisma and
good looks, that can't be

44
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,270
quantified on a balance sheet.

45
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,880
Or maybe one of these assets
are worth more.

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,120
Maybe they've appreciated since
the the last time to the

47
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,310
bank wrote down their
balance sheet.

48
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,190
Or the last time that the bank
kind of a evaluated the

49
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,570
asset's worth.

50
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,790
And then we had another
situation.

51
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,670
And this is very relevant
to what's going on

52
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,120
in the world today.

53
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,060
Well what happens if
the market price is

54
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,389
below the book price?

55
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,990
So, that was the case where
the stock is trading

56
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,250
at $3.00 per share.

57
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,450
And $3.00 per share times half
a billion shares, that's a

58
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,390
$1.5 billion dollar market
value of its equity.

59
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,120
I think that's what I
wanted a write here,

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,680
market value of equity.

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,380
And what is the market
then saying?

62
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,660
Or at least the person who's
buying or selling the share

63
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,740
right at that moment, what
are they saying?

64
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,330
Well they're saying that, OK
Bank A, that's nice, you say

65
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,530
that your assets minus your
liabilities are worth $3

66
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,640
billion, but I don't
think that's true.

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,080
I think your assets minus your
liabilities are $1.5 billion.

68
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,780
And let's say, we can't read
anyone's brain, we don't know

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,730
why they think that.

70
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,260
Maybe they think there
are fewer assets.

71
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,980
Maybe they think there
are more liabilities.

72
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,740
But let's say that we do
read someone's brain.

73
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,650
They're like you know where I
think you're doing a little

74
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,450
bit of shadiness?

75
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,960
I think you're doing it on
this line right here.

76
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,970
I don't think that thing
is worth $4 billion.

77
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,400
I think that thing is
worth $2.5 billion.

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,520
And if this is worth $2.5
billion, then your total

79
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,370
assets are what?

80
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,090
There are a billion
and a half left.

81
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:23,850
And so your assets are
$24.5 billion.

82
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,990
I know this is a little
bit messy.

83
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,290
But if the market is saying that
this is a $3.00 stock,

84
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,290
$3.00 per share, then that
says your market

85
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,060
value is $1.5 billion.

86
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,610
And we don't know why the
market is saying that.

87
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,460
They're saying that because they
think that this thing is

88
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,190
not worth $4 billion.

89
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,600
They think it is worth
$2.5 billion.

90
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,610
So they think it's worth a
billion and a half less.

91
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,190
If this soon. is worth $2.5
billion, then all of this will

92
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,960
add up to, if I did my math
right, $24.5 billion, minus

93
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,140
$23 billion.

94
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,710
And then, that gets you to the
market value the equity.

95
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,090
So let's call that
market equity.

96
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,950
The market value equity
of $1.5 billion.

97
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,880
So this raises a very
interesting question.

98
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,950
How do people decide, or how
do especially the banks

99
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,769
themselves, decide what some
of these assets are worth?

100
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,959
And in particular, these CDOs.

101
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,310
Well there's a couple
of ways to do it.

102
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,170
And there are all kinds of
different schools of economic

103
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,200
philosophy.

104
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,750
You could put here what
you paid for it.

105
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,330
Maybe the bank originally paid
$4 billion back when real

106
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,720
estate could only go up,
or so people thought.

107
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,960
And all of these CDOs looked
like these great high yielding

108
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,040
instruments.

109
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,870
Based on those assumptions,
the bank says, I'll pay $4

110
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,560
billion for it.

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
They put on the books for $4
billion and they never kind of

112
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,020
reassessed it.

113
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,200
So they just put the
$4 billion at cost.

114
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,170
And then people would
have every right to

115
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,240
question that number.

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,840
And they'll be like, well
that doesn't make sense.

117
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,230
Since then, we know that housing
prices can go down.

118
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,550
We know that especially since
this was the riskiest slice of

119
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,730
the CDOs that these could be
completely wiped out, even if

120
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,570
we only have a small number
of defaults on mortgages.

121
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,240
And we know that you as the CFO
or the CEO of your bank

122
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,220
have every incentive to not
write the real value here

123
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,640
because you want to prop up the
stock because you have a

124
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,120
lot of options in the company.

125
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,100
And you are evaluated
on the stock price.

126
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,300
But anyway, maybe I'll make
another video on incentives.

127
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,590
So that's one way.

128
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,350
My phone is ringing.

129
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,590
I'll answer it later.

130
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,790
I'm too worked up to answer
the phone right now.

131
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,930
I need to channel this
energy into this.

132
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,090
But anyway, so that's one way of
saying it, the cost basis.

133
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,850
And now I'm going to introduce
some words that you might have

134
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,100
heard on the news.

135
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,540
   

136
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,580
I was going to say mark-to-model
and then my

137
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,140
brain was going to say
mark-to-market.

138
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,580
Mark-to-model.

139
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,310
So what this says is I'm going
to mark these assets, I'm

140
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,070
going to value these assets,
based on a model that I have.

141
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,900
I hired a bunch of PhDs
from the best

142
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,840
schools in the country.

143
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,540
These are rocket scientists and
some of them actually are.

144
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,700
They can put the man
on the moon.

145
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,750
And they're going to make fancy
computer models with

146
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,800
some assumptions.

147
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,560
And those are going
to spit out what

148
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,590
these things are worth.

149
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,130
So they're going to model the
behavior, how many of these

150
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,920
mortgages are going to
default, all of that.

151
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,810
And those numbers spit out a
number and maybe they say that

152
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,680
they're worth $3 billion.

153
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
And if that happened at any
period, the company would

154
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,430
actually have to restate this.

155
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,050
They would actually have to
say, oh this wasn't $4

156
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,020
billion, we're going to
have to restate that.

157
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,380
We're going to take
a write down.

158
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,180
And you've heard this
a lot when banks

159
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,770
report their earnings.

160
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,920
We took a write down.

161
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,550
We thought we had a
$4 billion asset.

162
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,410
Maybe that's what we paid
for it originally.

163
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,050
We re-ran our model based on
new assumptions, so were

164
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,650
marking to model, now we have
a $3 billion asset according

165
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,580
to our new assumptions
in our model.

166
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,310
So we are doing a $1
billion write off.

167
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,460
To go from $4 billion, what we
originally had on the books,

168
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,880
maybe that was our old
assumptions in our model, to

169
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,010
our new model.

170
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,510
And immediately, you should
be suspicious of that.

171
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,930
Because once again, you're being
dependent on the banks

172
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,230
to report on themselves.

173
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,440
Sure, these might be
well intentioned.

174
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,950
But at the end of the day, this
value is being set by a

175
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,940
model where the assumptions into
that model, and frankly I

176
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,180
don't care how fancy your model
is, and how many PhDs

177
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,300
the people who made the model
have. At the end of the day,

178
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,020
you can always rig this
number based on the

179
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,070
assumptions you make.

180
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,420
And frankly, the market has no
transparency you as far as

181
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,720
what assumptions you did make.

182
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,200
So it's very hard to believe.

183
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,080
But it's probably a better guess
than the $4 billion.

184
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,180
Especially, when they're
taking it down.

185
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,020
And I'll do a whole video on
this later on, you also have

186
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,470
to question why they keep
taking write downs.

187
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,080
Why their models keep
having to make

188
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,560
more pessimistic scenarios.

189
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,410
Maybe they're just
buying time.

190
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,480
Maybe the first time they run
their model, they actually say

191
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,800
it's worth zero.

192
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,970
In which case they
have zero equity.

193
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,440
Because if this is worth zero,
they only have $22 billion in

194
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,600
assets and $23 billion in
liabilities, which means they

195
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,020
have negative assets.

196
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,430
Which means that they
are insolvent.

197
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,710
Which means that they
should go bankrupt.

198
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,720
But they don't want
to do that.

199
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,430
They don't want to be
responsible for running the

200
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,110
company into the ground.

201
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,210
So they don't want to admit
all at once that these are

202
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:19,730
worth zero.

203
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,640
Maybe they'll admit it's worth
not four, it's worth three.

204
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,130
But then they'll go to the
market and they'll try to

205
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,730
raise more money.

206
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,910
And I'll explain that
in a little bit.

207
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,550
Because I know that can
get very complicated.

208
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,680
So this is mark-to-model.

209
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,669
You've heard a lot about it.

210
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,780
It's not a fancy concept.

211
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,789
The models might be fancy.

212
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,549
But it's just like, I'm going to
make my own assumptions to

213
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,630
figure out what they're worth.

214
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,929
And as you can imagine, they
aren't the most credible

215
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,510
assumptions of the
value of this.

216
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,500
The other idea is
mark-to-market.

217
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:53,060
   

218
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,870
And this essentially says, well
if this is an instrument

219
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,860
that is traded in some market.

220
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,250
Let's say that these CDOs, and
at least they used to be,

221
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,300
let's say that they are
traded in some market.

222
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,420
That you actually assigned
the market price.

223
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,920
So maybe I have a a billion
of these CDOs.

224
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,020
And the market price of those
CDOs is a $1.50 per CDO.

225
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,290
I'm just making up numbers.

226
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,730
In which case, the market
value of them would be a

227
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,200
billion and a half.

228
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,160
So if you did mark-to-market,
you would have to make this

229
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,680
into a billion and a half.

230
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,590
Then you would have to do
another write down.

231
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,370
Now, why does doesn't
everyone do that?

232
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,130
I actually think that's
a very good question.

233
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,880
I'll tell you why the banks
don't want to do that.

234
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,520
   

235
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,220
Well first of all, some of these
markets, since no one

236
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,300
wants to buy these things,
because maybe they think

237
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,220
they're actually worth zero, the
markets have disappeared.

238
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,260
And the few people that are
selling them, they're usually

239
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,240
selling them when they are
distressed in some way.

240
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,230
So it's a quote unquote
fire sale.

241
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,030
So people are arguing that the
market price is not reflective

242
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,770
of the true value of
these securities.

243
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,440
They're arguing that the few
people who transacted did it

244
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,310
out of desperation.

245
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,636
So that $1.5 billion value of
these CDOs, the market value

246
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:12,000
of these CDOs, is not
truly accurate.

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,170
So these companies are saying,
no I cannot admit what the

248
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,680
market, what capitalism, is
telling me what the price is.

249
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,340
Even though these people are
the same people who've been

250
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,560
for the last 30 years saying
let the market determine

251
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,180
everything.

252
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,540
I make $20 million a year
because I'm a capitalist and

253
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,850
because I have taken risk.

254
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,020
And that I deserve that money.

255
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,050
And these are the same people
now, they're very adamant,

256
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,540
that says, oh don't believe
the market price.

257
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,440
Because the market
is wrong now.

258
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,250
Our PhDs are correct.

259
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,730
And if you think about
it, it's a very

260
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,970
communist way of thinking.

261
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,160
Because in communist
governments, they didn't

262
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,450
believe in markets, they
believed in hiring the

263
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,350
smartest people that they
could find, i.e.

264
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,250
the PhDs of their relative
countries, to essentially

265
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,890
engineer their markets
to determine

266
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,110
what things are worth.

267
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,900
Without letting the market
set the price.

268
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,990
Anyway, I'm not going
to vent on.

269
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,330
That is supposed to
instruct you.

270
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,730
As opposed to make you angry.

271
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,540
Although I think just by
learning about this,

272
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,610
you might get angry.

273
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,500
But anyway, that's what
mark-to-market means.

274
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,670
And I just realized I'm out of
time again because of my rant.

275
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,250
So I will see you in
the next video.

276
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,450
And we'll continue to learn
the nuance of everything

277
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,260
that's going on.

278
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,510
