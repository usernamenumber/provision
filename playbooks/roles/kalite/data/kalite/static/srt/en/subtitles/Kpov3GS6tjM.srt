1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,289
In this video

2
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:07,205
we're going to talk a little bit about amines.

3
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:08,373
And these are just organic compounds

4
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:09,868
where you have a nitrogen

5
00:00:09,868 --> 00:00:13,149
bonded to groups that contain carbon.

6
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:16,590
So if I were to just draw some amines right here

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,703
you could have something like this

8
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:20,965
where you have a nitrogen bonded to two hydrogens

9
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:22,439
and then maybe some type of carbon chain.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,240
Maybe it's just one carbon right here.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,355
So maybe you have a carbon

12
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:30,750
which is also bonded to three hydrogens like this.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,480
In this case you would have a primary amine.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,140
If you have the nitrogen bonded to two carbons.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,902
So if you have something like this

16
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:41,980
a nitrogen bonded to two carbons.

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,313
So it has one carbon chain right there.

18
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:46,334
And I'm just drawing methyl groups here.

19
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:48,620
The chain could keep on going.

20
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,180
Maybe you have two like that.

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,500
And then you have a hydrogen right there.

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,950
This would be a secondary amine.

23
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,475
And then finally you could imagine

24
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,340
if you had it bonded to three

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,942
it would be a tertiary amine.

26
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:08,419
This is just to get you introduced to the terminology.

27
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:11,040
CH3, just like that.

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,251
Now like all of the other new groups

29
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:16,606
or new types of compounds that we've explored

30
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:17,757
what I want to do is just

31
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:19,095
introduce you to the naming of it.

32
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:20,973
Because one, that lets you recognize them

33
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:22,490
when you hear their names.

34
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,342
But it also, I think on some level

35
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:26,470
familiarizes you with their structure.

36
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,550
So let's do a couple of naming examples.

37
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,890
I drew these ahead of time.

38
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,411
And in general, just to remember

39
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:35,360
amines are a pretty high-priority group.

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,141
Out of all the things that we've learned so far

41
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:39,960
the only thing that is a higher priority

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,710
is actually the alcohols.

43
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,662
Or actually the thiols

44
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:45,900
which I don't even remember if I did a video on it.

45
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,710
But thiols are just like alcohols

46
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,120
but instead of an oxygen you have a sulfur.

47
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,560
So this comes right after those.

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
So let's think about this one right here.

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,014
So we always want to

50
00:01:56,014 --> 00:01:58,223
look for our longest carbon chain.

51
00:01:58,223 --> 00:01:59,890
And our longest carbon chain is right here.

52
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,220
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 carbons.

53
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,348
You want to start numbering it

54
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:06,650
closer to the functional group.

55
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:13,770
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

56
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,238
And then the functional group

57
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:18,590
is on the two carbon right there.

58
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,390
So first of all, seven carbons.

59
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,120
We would use the prefix hept.

60
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,955
So it would be heptan. Let me write that down.

61
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:32,429
And since our functional group is an amine

62
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:33,520
in this situation

63
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,480
it has a higher priority than the fact this is an alkane.

64
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,673
So this will actually define the suffix.

65
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:44,126
So we would then say

66
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:46,505
well then on the two carbon

67
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:47,857
-- let me do this in new color--

68
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:50,007
on the two carbon right over here

69
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:51,418
we have the amine group.

70
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:58,228
So it's heptan-2-amine.

71
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:58,928
And we're done.

72
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,535
We know that we have an amine group

73
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,367
on the twocarbon.

74
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:04,400
Now let's do this one.

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
This one's a little bit more hairy.

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,641
So first of all, we always want to figure out

77
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:08,877
the longest carbon chain.

78
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:11,366
And it looks like the ring

79
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,140
is going to be the longest carbon chain.

80
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,920
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 carbons.

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,050
So this thing right here is the longest chain.

82
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,890
We only have 1, 2 carbons right there.

83
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,280
One carbon and one carbon, right over there.

84
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,738
So our root is going to be cyclohexane.

85
00:03:34,738 --> 00:03:36,720
I want to make sure I have enough space.

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,194
Cyclohexane.

87
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:42,889
And then once again it's an amine

88
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,971
so this is going to take higher priority.

89
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,850
So we're not just going to put an e at the end

90
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,190
and call this cyclohexane.

91
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,078
This takes higher priority.

92
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:55,000
So it will actually define the suffix.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,824
And another thing to think about is

94
00:03:56,824 --> 00:04:02,316
you could say, OK, this is going to be the one carbon

95
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:06,335
And so you could call this cyclohexan-1-amine.

96
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:08,541
But in general, if this is defining it

97
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,458
you always assume that

98
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,433
you're going to start numbering

99
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:12,805
right there at number one.

100
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:18,046
So you could just call this cyclohexanamine.

101
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:19,169
If it's written like this

102
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:21,429
you assume that the one carbon

103
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,774
is where the amine group is attached.

104
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:25,760
Now what else do we have on this thing?

105
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,610
We took care of the amine.

106
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,920
We took care of the cyclo.

107
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,340
Well we have this ether right here.

108
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,590
And this ether has 1, 2 carbons.

109
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,621
If it was just a two carbon chain, it would be ethane.

110
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:38,337
But since what we have it's an ether

111
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:39,819
it's bonded to this oxygen

112
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,825
we call this ethoxy.

113
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:46,341
So that right there is ethoxy.

114
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:47,153
And we're going to have to think about

115
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,239
how we're going to number this.

116
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,665
So I'll leave that alone.

117
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:50,530
And what are these over here?

118
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,260
Well this is a methyl group. That's a CH3 implicitly.

119
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,966
You don't see it drawn, but there's a carbon there.

120
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:59,940
And if carbon is neutral, it has to have four bonds.

121
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,892
And if you only draw one of them

122
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,650
the other three are assumed to be the hydrogen.

123
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,370
So this is a methyl group.

124
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,900
And then this is also a methyl group.

125
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,190
So we have dimethyl.

126
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,510
So this is also a methyl group right over there.

127
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,702
And when we think about numbering

128
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:19,886
we could number from 1, 2, 3.

129
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,980
Or we could start numbering 1, 2, 3.

130
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,480
And in general

131
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,893
you want to go numbering in the direction

132
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:25,911
where you hit the functional group first.

133
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:32,380
So we want to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

134
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,702
So this right here is 5-ethoxy.

135
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:39,450
And this is one, two dimethyl.

136
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,362
These two combined

137
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:47,992
you would call this one comma two dimethyl.

138
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:50,721
And then when you want to list them in order

139
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:53,255
the ethoxy would take precedence in alphabetical

140
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:54,904
because the di you shouldn't count

141
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,434
in the alphabetical order.

142
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:58,460
This is just saying two methyls.

143
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,092
So you really just want to look at the two

144
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,340
of whatever you're talking about.

145
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,180
M comes after e in alphabetical order.

146
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,970
So this is going to be 5-ethoxy.

147
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,810
Actually let me just rewrite the whole thing.

148
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:17,320
So this is going to be 5-ethoxy

149
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:38,095
1,2-dimethylcyclohexanamine.

150
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:40,230
And we're done.

151
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,415
This was probably one of the longest words

152
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:43,510
we've used in naming.

153
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,382
But hopefully you see

154
00:06:44,382 --> 00:06:46,097
when you break down the different pieces

155
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:47,061
it actually makes sense

156
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,138
that it represents this molecule.
