1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
   

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,900
We're asked to simplify d times
4d to the 1/2 power.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,000
So let's see what
we can do here.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,540
And I think there's multiple
ways to kind of simplify it,

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,260
and we'll explore all of them.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,150
So d times 4d to the 1/2.

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,060
4d to the 1/2, let me just focus
on that right there.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,490
4d to the 1/2.

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,360
If you take the product of two
things and you raise that to

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,110
an exponent, that's the same
thing as taking each of those

11
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,950
terms to that exponent and
then taking the product.

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:33,210
So 4d to the 1/2 is the same
thing as 4 to the 1/2 times d

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,260
to the 1/2.

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,190
And of course, you have
this d out front.

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,670
And I could put the parentheses
here, but it

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,730
doesn't matter at this point.

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,250
Now you just have three
things that you're

18
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,590
taking the product of.

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,310
So I'll put this d out
front just like that.

20
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,230
And now there's a couple of ways
you could think about it.

21
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,130
You have this 4 to the 1/2 power
and you're taking its

22
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,650
principal square root, so its
positive square root.

23
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,030
So that right there
is going to be 2.

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,780
So 4 to the 1/2, that
right there is going

25
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,790
to be equal to 2.

26
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,180
And then, there's a couple of
ways you could think about it.

27
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,740
You have this d out front.

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,990
And then you have
a d to the 1/2.

29
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,660
   

30
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,440
And there's several ways that
you can now represent this,

31
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,640
depending on what you feel--
I don't know--

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,120
aesthetically pleasant.

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,110
You could say, well look, this
is d to the first power.

34
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,590
This is d to the 1/2 power.

35
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,580
I could add them.

36
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,330
So one way to say it is it's 2
times d to the 1 plus 1/2.

37
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,630
You can either say 1 and
1/2 power or 3/2

38
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,110
power if you want.

39
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,810
So that's one simplification
of this expression.

40
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,470
Another simplification would be
well, you could say, look.

41
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,280
d to the 1/2, that is the same
thing as the square root of d.

42
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,650
So you could say this is the
same thing as 2 times d times

43
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,670
the square root of d.

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,570
So any of these are actual
simplifications, but it's

45
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,030
interesting to see that
they're really all

46
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,800
representing the same thing.

47
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,200
