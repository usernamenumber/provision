1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,856
   

2
00:00:00,856 --> 00:00:03,640
Let's review a little bit of
what we had learned many, many

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,640
videos ago about gravitational
potential energy and then see

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,005
if we can draw the analogy,
which is actually very strong,

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,640
to electrical potential
energy.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,380
So what do we know about

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,660
gravitational potential energy?

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,930
If we said this was the surface
of the Earth-- we

9
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,390
don't have to be on Earth, but
it makes visualization easy.

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,460
We could be anywhere that has
gravity, and the potential

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,850
energy would be due to the
gravitational field of that

12
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,800
particular mass, but let's
say this is the

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,500
surface of the Earth.

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,270
We learned that if we have some
mass m up here and that

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,610
the gravitational field at this
area-- or at least the

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,770
gravitational acceleration-- is
g, or 9.8 meters per second

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,775
squared, and it is h-- we could
say, I guess, meters,

18
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:52,070
but we could use any units.

19
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,690
Let's say it is h meters above
the ground, that the

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,900
gravitational potential energy
of this object at that point

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:05,340
is equal to the mass times the
acceleration of gravity times

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,870
the height, or you could view
it as the force of gravity,

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,550
the magnitude of the
force of gravity.

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,172
You know, it's a vector, but
we can say the magnitude of

25
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:19,790
the vector times height.

26
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,250
And so what is potential
energy?

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,010
Well, we know that if something
has potential energy

28
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,740
and if nothing is stopping it
and we just let go, that

29
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,580
energy, at least with
gravitational potential

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,840
energy, the object will start
accelerating downwards, and a

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,350
lot of that potential energy,
and eventually all of it, will

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,990
be converted to kinetic
energy.

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,730
So potential energy is energy
that is being stored by an

34
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,180
object's situation or kind of
this notional energy that an

35
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,530
object has by virtue
of where it is.

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,550
So in order for something to
have this notional energy,

37
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,200
some energy must have
been put into it.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,700
And as we learned with
gravitational potential

39
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,600
energy, you could view
gravitational potential energy

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,780
as the work necessary to move
an object to that position.

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,840
Now, if we're talking about work
to move something into

42
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,050
that position, or whatever, we
always have to think about,

43
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,000
well, move it from where?

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,720
Well, when we talk about
gravitational potential

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,610
energy, we're talking about
moving it from the surface of

46
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,990
the Earth, right?

47
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,180
And so how much work is required
to move that same

48
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,040
mass-- let's say it was here at
first-- to move it from a

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,140
height of zero to
a height of h?

50
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,950
Well, the whole time, the
Earth, or the force of

51
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,940
gravity, is going to
be F sub g, right?

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,890
So essentially, if I'm pulling
it or pushing it upwards, I'm

53
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,670
going to have to have-- and
let's say at a constant

54
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,130
velocity-- I'm going to have to
have an equal and opposite

55
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,940
force to its weight
to pull it up.

56
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,240
Otherwise, it would accelerate
downwards.

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,870
I'd have to do a little bit more
just to get it moving, to

58
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,510
accelerate it however much, but
then once I get it just

59
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,510
accelerating, essentially I
would have to apply an upward

60
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,830
force, which is equivalent to
the downward force of gravity,

61
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,110
and I would do it for a
distance of h, right?

62
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,720
What is work?

63
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,850
Work is just force
times distance.

64
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,850
Force times distance, and it
has to be force in the

65
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,860
direction of the distance.

66
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,650
So what's the work necessary
to get this mass up here?

67
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:25,370
Well, the work is equal to the
force of gravity times height,

68
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,620
so it's equal to the

69
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,870
gravitational potential energy.

70
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,110
Now this is an interesting
thing.

71
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,550
Notice we picked the reference
point as the surface of the

72
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,470
Earth, but we could
have picked any

73
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,620
arbitrary reference point.

74
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,900
We could have said, well, from
10 meters below the surface of

75
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,170
the Earth, which could have been
down here, or we could

76
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,410
have actually said, you know,
from a platform that's 5

77
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,156
meters above the Earth.

78
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:50,520
So it actually turns out, when
you think of it that way, that

79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,980
potential energy of any form,
but especially gravitational

80
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,400
potential energy-- and we'll
see electrical potential

81
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,430
energy-- it's always in
reference to some other point,

82
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,800
so it's really a change in
potential energy that matters.

83
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,490
And I know when we studied
potential energy, it seemed

84
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,620
like there was kind of an
absolute potential energy, but

85
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,720
that's because we always assume
that the potential

86
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,710
energy of something is zero the
surface of the Earth and

87
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,210
that we want to know the
potential energy relative to

88
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,459
the surface of the Earth, so it
would be kind of, you know,

89
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,440
how much work does it take to
take something from the

90
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,440
surface of the Earth
to that height?

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,710
But really, we should be saying,
well, the potential

92
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,320
energy of gravity-- like this
statement shouldn't be, you

93
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,480
know, this is just the absolute

94
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,890
potential energy of gravity.

95
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,330
We should say this is the
potential energy of gravity

96
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,230
relative to the surface of the
Earth is equal to the work

97
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,420
necessary to move something, to
move that same mass, from

98
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,780
the surface of the Earth to
its current position.

99
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:53,630
We could have defined some other
term that is not really

100
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,520
used, but we could have said
potential energy of gravity

101
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,310
relative to minus 5 meters
below the surface of the

102
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,080
Earth, and that would be the
work necessary to move

103
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,070
something from minus 5 meters
to its current height.

104
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,130
And, of course, that
might matter.

105
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,500
What if we cut up a hole and
we want to see what is the

106
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,350
kinetic energy here?

107
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,520
Well, then that potential
energy would matter.

108
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,170
Anyway, so I just wanted to do
this review of potential

109
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,960
energy because now it'll make
the jump to electrical

110
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,890
potential energy all that
easier, because you'll

111
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,380
actually see it's pretty
much the same thing.

112
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,170
It's just the source of the
field and the source of the

113
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,630
potential is something
different.

114
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,570
   

115
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,550
So electrical potential energy,
just actually we know

116
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,270
that gravitational fields are
not constant, we can assume

117
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,140
they're constant maybe near the
surface of the Earth and

118
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,770
all that, but we also know that
electrical fields aren't

119
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,180
constant, and actually they
have very simple formulas.

120
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,720
But just for the simplicity of
explaining it, let's assume a

121
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,900
constant electric field.

122
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,190
And if you don't believe me that
one can be constructed,

123
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,620
you should watch my videos that
involve a reasonable bit

124
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,930
of calculus that show that a
uniform electric field can be

125
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,520
generated by an infinite
uniformly charged plane.

126
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,210
Let's say this is the side view
of an infinite uniformly

127
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,960
charged plane and let's
say that this

128
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,700
is positively charged.

129
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,480
   

130
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,490
Of course, you can never get
a proper side view of an

131
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,370
infinite plane, because you
can never kind of cut it,

132
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,390
because it's infinite in every
direction, but let's say that

133
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,890
this one is and this
is the side view.

134
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,560
So first of all, let's think
about its electric field.

135
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,230
It's electric field is going to
point upward, and how do we

136
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,740
know it points upward?

137
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,450
Because the electric field is
essentially what is-- and this

138
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,530
is just a convention.

139
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,330
What would a positive charge
do in the field?

140
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,090
Well, if this plate is positive,
a positive charge,

141
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,530
we're going to want to
get away from it.

142
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,440
So we know the electric field
points upward and we know that

143
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,360
it's constant, that if these
were field vectors, that

144
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,510
they're going to be the same
size, no matter how far away

145
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,240
we get from the source
of the field.

146
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,310
And I'm just going to pick
a number for the

147
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,050
strength of the field.

148
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,050
We actually proved in those
fancy videos that I made on

149
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,340
the uniform electric field of an
infinite, uniformly charged

150
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,010
plane that we actually proved
how you could calculate it.

151
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:28,130
But let's just say that this
electric field is equal to 5

152
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,060
newtons per coulomb.

153
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,700
That's actually quite strong,
but it makes the math easy.

154
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:38,020
So my question to you is how
much work does it take to take

155
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,280
a positive point charge-- let
me pick a different color.

156
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,340
   

157
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,200
Let's say this is the
starting position.

158
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,770
It's a positive 2 coulombs.

159
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,440
Once again, that's a massive
point charge, but

160
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,700
we want easy numbers.

161
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:04,950
How much work does it take it to
move that 2-coulomb charge

162
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,240
3 meters within this field?

163
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,830
How much work?

164
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,510
So we're going to start here
and we're going to move it

165
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,110
down towards the plate 3
meters, and it's ending

166
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,120
position is going to be
right here, right?

167
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,300
That's when it's done.

168
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,790
How much work does that take?

169
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,600
Well, what is the force of
the field right here?

170
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,430
What is the force exerted on
this 2-coulomb charge?

171
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,840
Well, electric field is just
force per charge, right?

172
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,950
So if you want to know the force
of the field at that

173
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,570
point-- let me draw that
in a different color.

174
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,090
The force of the field acting on
it, so let's say the field

175
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:51,010
force, or the force of the
field, actually, is going to

176
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:57,040
be equal to 5 newtons per
coulomb times 2 coulombs,

177
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,590
which is equal to 10 newtons.

178
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,160
We know it's going to be upward,
because this is a

179
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,090
positive charge, and this is a
positively charged infinite

180
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,960
plate, so we know this is an
upward force of 10 newtons.

181
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,190
So in order to get this charge,
to pull it down or to

182
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,710
push it down here, we
essentially have to exert a

183
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,690
force of 10 newtons
downwards, right?

184
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,800
Exert a force of 10 newtons in
the direction of the movement.

185
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,610
And, of course, just like we did
with gravity, we have to

186
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,820
maybe do a little bit more than
that just to accelerate

187
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,985
it a little bit just so you have
some net downward force,

188
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,020
but once you do, you just have
to completely balance the

189
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,920
upward force.

190
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,930
So just for our purposes, you
have a 10-newton force

191
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,110
downward and you apply that
force for a distance of 3

192
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,870
meters, the work that you put to
take this 2-coulomb charge

193
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:49,050
from here to here, the work
is going to be equal to 10

194
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,850
newtons-- that's the force--
times 3 meters.

195
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,350
So the work is going to equal
30 newton-meters, which is

196
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,920
equal to 30 joules.

197
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,540
A joule is just a
newton-meter.

198
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,000
And so we can now say since it
took us 30 joules of energy to

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,810
move this charge from here to
here, that within this uniform

200
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:18,650
electric field, the potential
energy of the charge here is

201
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,880
relative to the charge here.

202
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,400
You always have to pick a point
relative to where the

203
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,600
potential is, so the electrical
potential energy

204
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:35,310
here relative to here and this
is electrical potential

205
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:41,690
energy, and you could say P2
relative to P1-- I'm using my

206
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,140
made-up notation, but that gives
you a sense of what it

207
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:50,830
is-- is equal to 30 joules.

208
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,870
And how could that help us?

209
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,680
Well, if we also knew the mass--
let's say that this

210
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,930
charge had some mass.

211
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,690
We would know that if we let go
of this object, by the time

212
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,000
it got here, that 30 joules
would be-- essentially

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,600
assuming that none of it got
transmitted to heat or

214
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,180
resistance or whatever-- we know
that all of it would be

215
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,200
kinetic energy at this point.

216
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,870
So actually, we could
work it out.

217
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:24,090
Let's say that this does have
a mass of 1 kilogram and we

218
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,210
were to just let go
of it, right?

219
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,330
We used some force to bring it
down here, and then we let go.

220
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,755
So we know that the electric
field is going to accelerate

221
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,320
it upwards, right?

222
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,160
It's going to exert an upward
force of 5 newtons per

223
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,990
coulomb, and the thing's going
to keep [COUGHS]--

224
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,920
excuse me-- keep accelerating
until it gets

225
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,260
to this point, right?

226
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,290
What's its velocity going
to be at that point?

227
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,610
Well, all of this electrical
potential energy is going to

228
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,610
be converted to kinetic
energy.

229
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,970
So essentially, we have 30
joules is going to be equal to

230
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,040
1/2 mv squared, right?

231
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,450
We know the mass, I said, is 1,
so we get 60 is equal to v

232
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,250
squared, so the velocity is the
square root of 60, so it's

233
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,930
7 point something, something,
something meters per second.

234
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,930
So if I just pull that charge
down, and it has a mass of 1

235
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,070
kilogram, and I let go, it's
just going to accelerate and

236
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,120
be going pretty fast once
it gets to this point.

237
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,785
Anyway, I'm 12 minutes into this
video, so I will continue

238
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,270
in the next, but hopefully, that
gives you a sense of what

239
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,990
electrical potential energy
is, and really, it's no

240
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,970
different than gravitational
potential energy.

241
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,080
It's just the source of the
field is different.

242
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,650
See you soon.

243
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:36,700
