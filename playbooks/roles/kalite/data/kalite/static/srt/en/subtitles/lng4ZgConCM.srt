1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
   

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,900
In the last few videos, we saw
that if we had n points, each

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,660
of them have x and
y-coordinates.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,430
Let me draw n of those points.

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,020
So let's call this point one.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,480
It has coordinates x1, y1.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,290
You have the second
point over here.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,950
It had coordinates x2, y2.

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,110
And we keep putting points up
here and eventually we get to

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,050
the nth point.

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,790
That has coordinates xn, yn.

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:37,350
What we saw is that there is a
line that we can find that

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,465
minimizes the squared
distance.

14
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:42,390
   

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,220
This line right here,
I'll call it y, is

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,240
equal to mx plus b.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,830
There's some line that minimizes
the square distance

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,450
to the points.

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,710
And let me just review what
those squared distances are.

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,690
Sometimes, it's called
the squared error.

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,450
So this is the error between
the line and point one.

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,450
So I'll call that error one.

23
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,680
This is the error between
the line and point two.

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,520
We'll call this error two.

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,990
This is the error between
the line and point n.

26
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,920
So if you wanted the total
error, if you want the total

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,290
squared error-- this is actually
how we started off

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,880
this whole discussion-- the
total squared error between

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:28,930
the points and the line, you
literally just take the y

30
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,040
value each point.

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,380
So for example, you
would take y1.

32
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:38,450
That's this value right over
here, you take y1 minus the y

33
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,050
value at this point
in the line.

34
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,320
Well, that point in the line is,
essentially, the y value

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,700
you get when you substitute
x1 into this equation.

36
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,620
So I'll just substitute
x1 into this equation.

37
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,630
So minus m x1 plus b.

38
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,000
This right here, that is the
this y value right over here.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,580
That is m x1 b.

40
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,760
I don't want to my get my
graph too cluttered.

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,060
So I'll just delete
that there.

42
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,960
That is error one right
over there.

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,970
And we want the squared errors
between each of the

44
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,630
points of the line.

45
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,880
So that's the first one.

46
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,280
Then you do the same thing
for the second point.

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,840
And we started our discussion
this way.

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:24,550
y2 minus m x2 plus b squared,
all the way-- I'll do dot dot

49
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,320
dot to show that there are a
bunch of these that we have to

50
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,510
do until we get to the nth
point-- all the way to yn

51
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,870
minus m xn plus b squared.

52
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,460
And now that we actually know
how to find these m's and b's,

53
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,280
I showed you the formula.

54
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,050
And in fact, we've proved
the formula.

55
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,470
We can find this line.

56
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,010
And if we want to say, well,
how much error is there?

57
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,000
We can then calculate it.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Because we now know the
m's and the b's.

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,430
So we can calculate it for
certain set of data.

60
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,460
Now, what I want to do is kind
of come up with a more

61
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,070
meaningful estimate of how good
this line is fitting the

62
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,920
data points that we have. And to
do that, we're going to ask

63
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:25,290
ourselves the question, what
percentage of the variation in

64
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:39,690
y is described by the
variation in x?

65
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,750
So let's think about this.

66
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,060
How much of the total variation
in y-- there's

67
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,540
obviously variation in y.

68
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,450
This y value is over here.

69
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,820
This point's y value
is over here.

70
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,430
There is clearly a bunch
of variation in the y.

71
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,680
But how much of that is
essentially described by the

72
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,450
variation in x?

73
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,750
Or described by the line?

74
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,690
So let's think about that.

75
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,510
First, let's think about what
the total variation is.

76
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,500
How much of the total
variation in y?

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,620
So let's just figure out what
the total variation in y is.

78
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,550
   

79
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,880
It's really just a tool
for measuring.

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,760
   

81
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,035
When we think about variation,
and this is even true when we

82
00:04:17,035 --> 00:04:21,790
thought about variance, which
was the mean variation in y.

83
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,280
If you think about the squared
distance from some central

84
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,660
tendency, and the best central
measure we can have of y is

85
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,260
the arithmetic mean.

86
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,120
So we could just say, the total
variation in y is just

87
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,440
going to be the sum of the
distances of each of the y's.

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:54,010
So you get y1 minus the mean
of all the y's squared.

89
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,880
Plus y2 minus the mean of
all the y's squared.

90
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,850
Plus, and you just keep
going all the way

91
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,730
to the nth y value.

92
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,030
To yn minus the mean of
all the y's squared.

93
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,350
This gives you the total
variation in y.

94
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,410
You can just take out
all the y values.

95
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,240
Find their mean.

96
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,480
It'll be some value, maybe it's

97
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,730
right over here someplace.

98
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,660
   

99
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,680
And so you can even visualize it
the same way we visualized

100
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
the squared error
from the line.

101
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,650
So if you visualize it, you can
imagine a line that's y is

102
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,640
equal to the mean of y.

103
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,180
Which would look
just like that.

104
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,080
And what we're measuring over
here, this error right over

105
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,960
here, is the square of this
distance right over here.

106
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,850
Between this point vertically
and this line.

107
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,430
The second one is going
to be this distance.

108
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,770
Just right up to the line.

109
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,620
And the nth one is going to be
the distance from there all

110
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,970
the way to the line
right over there.

111
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,430
And there are these other
points in between.

112
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,430
This is the total
variation in y.

113
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,240
Makes sense.

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:03,410
If you divide this by n, you're
going to get what we

115
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,310
typically associate as the
variance of y, which is kind

116
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,760
of the average squared
distance.

117
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,370
Now, we have the total
squared distance.

118
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,615
So what we want to do is-- how
much of the total variation in

119
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:19,240
y is described by the
variation in x?

120
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,410
So maybe we can think
of it this way.

121
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,610
So our denominator, we want what
percentage of the total

122
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,650
variation in y?

123
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,030
Let me write it this way.

124
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,820
Let me call this the squared
error from the average.

125
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:33,380
   

126
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,450
Maybe I'll call this
the squared error

127
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,110
from the mean of y.

128
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,560
And this is really the
total variation in y.

129
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,030
So let's put that as
the denominator.

130
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,650
The total variation in y, which
is the squared error

131
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,640
from the mean of the y's.

132
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,120
Now we want to what percentage
of this is described by the

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,780
variation in x.

134
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,670
Now, what is not described
by the variation in x?

135
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,190
We want to how much is
described by the

136
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,880
variation in x.

137
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:20,550
But what if we want how much of
the total variation is not

138
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:29,980
described by the regression
line?

139
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,610
   

140
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,030
Well, we already have
a measure for that.

141
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,410
We have the squared
error of the line.

142
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,690
This tells us the square of the
distances from each point

143
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,550
to our line.

144
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,450
So it is exactly this measure.

145
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,480
It tells us how much of the
total variation is not

146
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,680
described by the regression
line.

147
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,160
So if you want to know what
percentage of the total

148
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:00,350
variation is not described by
the regression line, it would

149
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,410
just be the squared error of the
line, because this is the

150
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,400
total variation not described
by the regression line,

151
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,790
divided by the total
variation.

152
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,610
So let me make it clear.

153
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:25,890
This, right over here, tells
us what percentage of the

154
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:34,659
total variation is not
described by the

155
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,909
variation in x.

156
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:41,480
   

157
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,070
Or by the regression line.

158
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,340
   

159
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,040
So to answer our question, what
percentage is described

160
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,140
by the variation?

161
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,130
Well, the rest of it has
to be described by the

162
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,880
variation in x.

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,930
Because our question is what
percent of the total variation

164
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,560
is described by the
variation in x.

165
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,850
This is the percentage that
is not described.

166
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:10,290
So if this number is 30%-- if
30% of the variation in y is

167
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,970
not described by the line, then
the remainder will be

168
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,210
described by the line.

169
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,240
So we could essentially just
subtract this from 1.

170
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,390
So if we take 1 minus the
squared error between our data

171
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:29,930
points and the line over the
squared error between the y's

172
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:38,120
and the mean y, this actually
tells us what percentage of

173
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:46,185
total variation is described
by the line.

174
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,240
You can either view it's
described by the line or by

175
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,520
the variation in x.

176
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:58,190
   

177
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,170
And this number right here, this
is called the coefficient

178
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,420
of determination.

179
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,170
   

180
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,120
It's just what statisticians
have decided to name it.

181
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:17,080
   

182
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,290
And it's also called
R-squared.

183
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,960
You might have even heard that
term when people talk about

184
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,770
regression.

185
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,250
Now let's think about it.

186
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:33,260
If the squared error of the
line is really small

187
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,340
what does that mean?

188
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,310
It means that these
errors, right over

189
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,580
here, are really small.

190
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,850
Which means that the line
is a really good fit.

191
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:50,000
   

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,960
So let me write it over here.

193
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,950
If the squared error of the
line is small, it tells us

194
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,250
that the line is a good fit.

195
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:05,430
   

196
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,910
Now, what would happen
over here?

197
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,920
Well, if this number is really
small, this is going to be a

198
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,340
very small fraction over here.

199
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,330
1 minus a very small fraction
is going to be a

200
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,950
number close to 1.

201
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:26,980
So then, our R-squared will be
close to 1, which tells us

202
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,640
that a lot of the variation
in y is described by the

203
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,520
variation in x.

204
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,360
Which makes sense, because
the line is a good fit.

205
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,780
You take the opposite case.

206
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:43,210
If the squared error of the line
is huge, then that means

207
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,420
there's a lot of error between
the data points and the line.

208
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,870
So if this number is huge, then
this number over here is

209
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,370
going to be huge.

210
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,740
Or it's going to be a percentage
close to 1.

211
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,410
And 1 minus that is going
to be close to 0.

212
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:07,590
And so if the squared error of
the line is large, this whole

213
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,590
thing's going to
be close to 1.

214
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,510
And if this whole thing is
close to 1, the whole

215
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,416
coefficient of determination,
the whole R-squared, is going

216
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,590
to be close to 0, which
makes sense.

217
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:20,600
   

218
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,920
That tells us that very little
of the total variation in y is

219
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,680
described by the variation in
x, or described by the line.

220
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,630
Well, anyway, everything I've
been dealing with so far has

221
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,980
been a little bit
in the abstract.

222
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,900
In the next video, we'll
actually look at some data

223
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,480
samples and calculate their
regression line.

224
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,310
And also calculate the
R-squared, and see how good of

225
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,300
a fit it really is.

226
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,734
