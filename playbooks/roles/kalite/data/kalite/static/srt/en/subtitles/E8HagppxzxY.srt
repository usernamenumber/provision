1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830
   

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,500
We're on problem 55.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:15,050
If y is equal to 4 plus x minus
3 squared, then y is

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,140
lowest when x is equal to-- so
think about when will this

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,950
expression be the lowest
possible number?

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,460
Well, if you think about this
whole term, right here, this x

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,770
minus 3 squared.

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,350
Any number squared, if we're
dealing with real numbers, is

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,210
going to be a positive
number, right?

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,170
So you could say that x minus
3 squared is going to be

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,920
greater than or equal
to 0, right?

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,820
0 is kind of its
minimum point.

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,080
So this whole value is going
to be as small as possible

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,700
when x minus 3 squared is as
small as possible, right?

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,330
Because that's the variable
part of it.

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,790
And this is going to be as small
as possible when x minus

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,470
3 is equal to 0.

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,700
And when is x minus 3 going
to be equal to 0?

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,440
We could write it out.

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,110
When is x minus 3 equal to 0?

21
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,330
Well, add 3 to both sides.

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,050
It's when x is equal to 3.

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,840
So y is lowest when x minus
3 is equal to 0 or

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,350
x is equal to 3.

25
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,850
And that's choice D.

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,660
And all you have to recognize is
the lowest value that this

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,360
function can attain is when this
term goes to 0, because

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,720
otherwise it's a
positive term.

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,700
It will only add to the 4.

30
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,720
Next problem.

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,000
56.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,720
Which of the following
is not equal to the

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,990
square of an integer?

34
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,840
   

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,120
So they say the square root
of the square root of 1.

36
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,520
The square root of 1 is 1.

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,380
And the square root of that
is going to be equal to 1.

38
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,980
You could have said negative
1, but then that would have

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,170
been undefined.

40
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:44,600
Fair enough.

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,700
One of the roots of
the roots is 1.

42
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,490
And this is the square
of an integer, right?

43
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,800
This is equal to 1 squared.

44
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,930
2.

45
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,660
Square root of 4.

46
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,800
Square root of 4,
that equals 2.

47
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,680
Now is that the square
of an integer?

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,870
No.

49
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,600
That's equal to square root of 2
squared, but this clearly is

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,390
not an integer.

51
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,180
Right?

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,920
So the choice is 2.

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,850
2 is not equal to the square
of an integer.

54
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,570
We could look at
the other ones.

55
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,800
18 divided by 2.

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,070
Yes.

57
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,510
9 is the square of 3.

58
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,820
41 minus 25.

59
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,820
That's 16.

60
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,460
36.

61
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,660
So all of the other ones are
squares of integers.

62
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,190
That's a fairly

63
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,318
straightforward problem, I think.

64
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,140
We're on problem 57.

65
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,890
Fermat primes are prime numbers
that can be written in

66
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,890
the form 2 to the K plus 1,
where K is an integer and a

67
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,140
power of 2.

68
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:53,530
   

69
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,800
Which of the following is
not a Fermat prime?

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,210
So A, 3.

71
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,445
Well 3 is equal to what?

72
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:04,050
It's equal to 2 to
the 1 plus 1.

73
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,270
Right?

74
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,750
And in this case K is 1,
which is a power of 2.

75
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,880
That's 2 to the 0.

76
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,180
B is 5.

77
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,100
Well, 5 is what?

78
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,030
That equals 2 squared plus 1.

79
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,800
4 plus 1.

80
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,020
And this is definitely
a power of 2.

81
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,190
2 is a power of 2.

82
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,600
2

83
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,180
to the 1st. C.

84
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,850
17.

85
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,640
That's 2 to the 4th plus 1.

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:30,900
Right?

87
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,350
2 to the 4th is 16 plus
1 and 4 is 2 squared.

88
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,530
So that's a power of 2.

89
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,330
Choice D.

90
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,120
31.

91
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,710
The closest power, if we
subtract 1 from it.

92
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:50,330
   

93
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,960
2 to something does not
equal 30, right?

94
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,510
That would have to be true
if 2 to the K plus

95
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,720
1 is equal to 31.

96
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,060
Then 2 to the K would
have to equal 30.

97
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,250
And I can't think of an integer
where I take 2 to some

98
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,110
power and get 30.

99
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,800
So the choice is D.

100
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,120
D is not a Fermat prime.

101
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,725
And if you wanted to make
sure that it's not E.

102
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:10,400
E is 257.

103
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,120
Well that's just 2 to
the 8th plus 1.

104
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,570
2 to the 8th is 256.

105
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,120
And that's 257.

106
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,589
So the answer is D.

107
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,720
58.

108
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:37,440
If x squared is equal to 2y to
the third, and 2y is equal to

109
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:46,500
4, they want to know what x
squared plus y is equal to.

110
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,730
OK, x squared plus y.

111
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,900
Well, they tell us
that x squared is

112
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,055
equal to y to the third.

113
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:53,320
So let's just substitute that.

114
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,640
Right?

115
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,720
So then we get 2y to the third
plus y, using this information

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,170
and that information.

117
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,810
And they tell us 2y
is equal to 4.

118
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,360
Well, just divide both sides by
2, you get y is equal to 2.

119
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,730
So let's substitute
that into this.

120
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,500
What's 2 to the third power?

121
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,300
Well, that's 8 plus 2.

122
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,360
So I don't want to divide.

123
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,800
So that equals 16 plus 2,
which is equal to 18.

124
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,440
Which is choice E.

125
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,180
Next problem.

126
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,290
59.

127
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:40,270
A glucose solution contains 15
grams of glucose per 100 cubic

128
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,690
centimeters of solution.

129
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:50,140
   

130
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,120
If 45 cubic centimeters of the
solution were poured into an

131
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,770
empty container, how many grams
of glucose would be in

132
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,140
the container?

133
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,090
So we can just set up a ratio.

134
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,500
We have 15 grams per 100, so how
many grams are we going to

135
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:10,000
have per 45 centimeters cubed?

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,230
How many grams, right?

137
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,550
So they still want to
know grams. All the

138
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,150
units are the same.

139
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,820
And so let's see if we
can cross multiply.

140
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,950
We could say 15 times 45 is
equal to 100 times x.

141
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:29,820
So 15 times 45 is
equal to 100x.

142
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,140
And just to make the
math easy, let's

143
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,240
divide by some numbers.

144
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,930
Let's divide both sides by 5.

145
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,395
So then this becomes 20
and this becomes 9.

146
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:42,420
We could divide both sides by 5
again and then this becomes

147
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,430
4 and this becomes 3.

148
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,080
And now the numbers are
easy to deal with.

149
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,750
3 times 9 is 27 is
equal to 4x.

150
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,860
Divide both sides by 4.

151
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,970
You get x is equal to 27/4.

152
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,540
27/4 and 4 goes into 27.

153
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:02,990
what is that?

154
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:10,590
That is equal to and 6 and 3/4,
and all their numbers are

155
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,160
in decimals, so that's 6.75.

156
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,860
Which is E.

157
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,080
Right?

158
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,120
4 times 6 is 24, and you
have 3 left over.

159
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Right.

160
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,150
Next problem.

161
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:25,790
Problem 60.

162
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,500
In the figure of P, Q, R,
S is a parallelogram.

163
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,480
Let me draw this.

164
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,680
This looks interesting.

165
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,046
So I have to draw a
couple of lines.

166
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:37,480
That's one line.

167
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,260
And they have another
line that looks

168
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,510
something like that.

169
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,700
   

170
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,475
It's a parallelogram.

171
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:47,076
Let me connect the lines.

172
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:48,570
It looks like that.

173
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,125
   

174
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,880
Let's see, this line actually
keeps going.

175
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Let me draw that in.

176
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,330
They tell us, this is P.

177
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,970
This is Q.

178
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,000
This is R.

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,165
And this is S.

180
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:10,720
And they tell us that
this is 140 degrees.

181
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,460
They tell us that this is 2y.

182
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,960
   

183
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,730
And they tell us
that this is x.

184
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,700
And then they say, in
the figure above,

185
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,080
what is y minus x?

186
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,110
So since we know this is a
parallelogram, we know that

187
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,720
this line is parallel to this
line, and we know that this

188
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,910
line is parallel to that line.

189
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,280
That actually tells us a lot of
information, especially if

190
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,770
we continue the lines over.

191
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,000
Then everything we learned in
geometry about parallel lines

192
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,250
starts to hold.

193
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,110
Let me draw it in a
different color.

194
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,300
So if this line, in green, is
parallel to this line, then

195
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,940
you can view this line right
here as a bit of a

196
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,410
transversal.

197
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,480
And 140 degrees and 2y are
corresponding angles.

198
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,030
So they're actually going
to equal each other.

199
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,840
And you can even eyeball it and
think about, well, that

200
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,320
make sense.

201
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,970
Those lines are parallel.

202
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,090
So 140 degrees is equal to 2y.

203
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,630
y is equal to 70.

204
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,880
Fair enough.

205
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,960
   

206
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,400
And now let's consider-- let me
switch colors-- that this

207
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,510
line right here, this magenta
line and this magenta line,

208
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,860
those two are parallel.

209
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,720
And we can now view this
as a transversal.

210
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,700
Right?

211
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,730
If this is a transversal, then
the 70 degrees and this angle

212
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,370
are corresponding angles, so
they're going to be equal.

213
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,600
So that's 70.

214
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,910
And then this angle up here,
that 70 degrees that I just

215
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,160
drew, and the x angle, they're
supplementary, right?

216
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,670
They add up to 180.

217
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,830
So you have x plus 70
is equal to 180.

218
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:51,210
So you get x is equal
to 110 degrees.

219
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:51,860
Oh, no, no, sorry.

220
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,690
I made a mistake.

221
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,100
I made a mistake.

222
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,030
So this angle isn't 70.
y is equal to 70.

223
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,450
But this angle is 2y, so
this is 140 degrees.

224
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:00,810
Right?

225
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,800
We figured out that this is 140
degrees, so this has to be

226
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,230
140 degrees.

227
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,020
And what my brain caught, I was
like, boy, that doesn't

228
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,360
look like 70 degrees.

229
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,900
70 degrees would be
a lot narrower.

230
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,990
That looks more like 140.

231
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,720
But anyway, this is 140.

232
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,640
So if this is 140, the
corresponding angle up here is

233
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,830
also going to be 140 degrees.

234
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,550
And so, I did that wrong.

235
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,210
x plus 140, right? x plus
this 140 degrees.

236
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,260
The logic is still the same.

237
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,570
They're supplementary.

238
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,970
Equals 180.

239
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,080
So x is equal to 40 degrees.

240
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,520
And they wanted to know what?

241
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,670
They wanted to know
what y minus x is.

242
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,680
So that's 30.

243
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,310
70 minus 40 is 30.

244
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,030
And that's choice A.

245
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,960
See you in the next video.
