1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:07,160
Let's have the vector valued
function r of s and t is equal

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,980
to-- well, x is going to
be a function of s and t.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,090
So we'll just write it as x of
s and t times the x unit

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:22,180
vector, or i, plus y of s and t
times the y unit factor, or j,

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:28,240
plus x of s and t times
the z unit vector, k.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,280
So given that we have this
vector valued function, let's

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,770
define or let's think about
what it means to take the

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,800
partial derivative of this
vector valued function with

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,620
respect to one of the
parameters, s or t.

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,040
I think it's going to be
pretty natural, nothing

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,420
completely bizarre here.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,030
We've taken partial derivatives
of non-vector valued functions

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,850
before, where we only vary
one of the variables.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,280
We only take it with
respect to one variable.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,770
You hold the other
one constant.

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,750
We're going to do the
exact same thing here.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,920
And we've taken regular
derivatives of vector

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,720
valued functions.

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,120
The path in those just ended up
being the regular derivative

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,490
of each of the terms.

22
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,180
And we're going to see, it's
going to be the same thing here

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,950
with the partial derivative.

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:14,670
So let's define the
partial derivative of

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,970
r with respect to s.

26
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,720
And everything I do with
respect to s, you can just swap

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,930
it with t, and you're going to
get the same exact result.

28
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,800
I'm going to define it as being
equal to the limit as delta

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:36,240
s approaches 0 of r
of s plus delta s.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,250
Only finding the limit
with respect to a

31
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,570
change in s comma t.

32
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,340
We're holding t, as you can
imagine, constant for given

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,190
t, minus r of s and t.

34
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:56,630
All of that over delta s.

35
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,270
Now, if you do a little bit of
algebra here, you literally,

36
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,980
you know-- r of s plus delta s
comma t, that's the same thing

37
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,310
as x of s plus delta s
t i, plus y of s plus

38
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,900
delta s t j, plus z.

39
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,740
All that minus this thing.

40
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,370
If you do a little bit of
algebra with that, and if you

41
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,070
don't believe me, try it out.

42
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:22,950
This is going to be equal to
the limit of delta s

43
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,620
approaching 0-- and I'm going
to write it small because it'd

44
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:33,120
take up a lot of space-- of x
of s plus delta s comma t minus

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,340
x of s and t, I think you
know where I'm going.

46
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,280
This is all a little bit
monotonous to write it all

47
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,440
out, but never hurts.

48
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,750
Times s or divided by delta s
times i-- and then I'll do it

49
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,100
in different colors, so it's
less monotonous-- plus y.

50
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,290
Where every-- those limited
delta s [? approaches ?]

51
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,720
0 applies to every term
I'm writing out here.

52
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:04,590
y of s plus delta s comma t
minus y of s comma t, all of

53
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,560
that over delta s times j.

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:19,240
And then finally, plus z of s
plus delta s comma t minus z of

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:27,910
s and t, all of that over delta
s times the z unit vector, k.

56
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,890
And this all comes out
of this definition.

57
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,990
If you literally just put s
plus delta s in place for s--

58
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,600
you evaluate all this, do a
little algebra-- you're going

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,500
to get the exact same thing.

60
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,110
And this, hopefully, pops out
at you as, gee, we're just

61
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,590
taking the partial derivative
of each of these functions

62
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,480
with respect to s.

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,040
And these functions right here,
this x of s and t, this is a

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,670
non-vector valued function.

65
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,450
This y, this is also a
non-vector valued function.

66
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,240
z is also a non-vector
valued function.

67
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,540
When you put them all together,
it becomes a vector valued

68
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,410
function, because we're
multiplying the first

69
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,270
one times a vector.

70
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,620
The second one times
another vector.

71
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,210
The third one times
another vector.

72
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,570
But independently,
these functions are

73
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,570
non-vector valued.

74
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,140
So this is just the
definition of the regular

75
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,110
partial derivatives.

76
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,170
Where we're taking the limit
as delta s approaches 0

77
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,020
in each of these cases.

78
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,380
So this is the
exact same thing.

79
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,530
This is equal to-- this is the
exact same thing as the partial

80
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:30,060
derivative of x with respect to
s times i plus the partial

81
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:38,000
derivative y with respect to s
times j plus the partial

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,700
derivative of z with
respect to s times k.

83
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,160
I'm going to do one more thing
here and this is pseudo mathy,

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,620
but it's going to come out--
the whole reason I'm even doing

85
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,650
this video, is it's going to
give us some good tools in our

86
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,470
tool kit for the videos that
I'm about to do on

87
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,190
surface integrals.

88
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,510
So I'm going to do one thing
here that's a little pseudo

89
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,990
mathy, and that's really
because differentials are these

90
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,600
things that are very hard to
define rigorously, but I think

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,510
it'll give you the intuition
of what's going on.

92
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,740
So this thing right here, I'm
going to say this is also equal

93
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,820
to-- and you're not going to
see this in any math textbook,

94
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,520
and hard core mathematicians
are going to kind of cringe

95
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,950
when they see me do this.

96
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,160
But I like to do it because
I think it'll give you the

97
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,090
intuition on what's going
on when we take our

98
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,990
surface integrals.

99
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,340
So I'm going to say that this
whole thing right here, that

100
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:36,910
that is equal to r of s plus
the differential of s-- a super

101
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:44,130
small change in s-- t minus r
of s and t, all of that

102
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,900
over that same super
small change in s.

103
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,440
So hopefully you understand
at least why I view

104
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,420
things this way.

105
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,930
When I take the limit as delta
s approaches 0, these delta s's

106
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,810
are going to get super
duper duper small.

107
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,370
And in my head, that's how
I imagine differentials.

108
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,365
When someone writes the
derivative of y with respect to

109
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:12,870
x-- and let's say that they say
that that is 2-- and we've done

110
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,290
a little bit of math with
differentials before.

111
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,400
You can imagine multiplying
both sides by dx, and you

112
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,210
could get dy is equal to 2dx.

113
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,670
We've done this
throughout calculus.

114
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,870
The way I imagine it is super
small change in y-- infinitely

115
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,830
small change in y-- is equal to
2 times-- though, you can

116
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,420
imagine an equally
small change in x.

117
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,880
So it's a-- well, if you have a
super small change in x, your

118
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,290
change in y is going to be
still super small, but it's

119
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,510
going to be 2 times that.

120
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,710
I guess that's the
best way to view it.

121
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,310
But in general, I view
differentials as super small

122
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,420
changes in a variable.

123
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,600
So with that out of the way,
and me explaining to you that

124
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,290
many mathematicians would
cringe at what I just wrote,

125
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,290
hopefully this gives you a
little-- this isn't like

126
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,080
some crazy thing I did.

127
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,240
I'm just saying, oh, delta
s as delta approaches 0, I

128
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,640
kind of imagine that as ds.

129
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,830
And the whole reason I did
that, is if you take this side

130
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,610
and that side, and multiply
both sides times this

131
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,690
differential ds,
then what happens?

132
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:23,250
The left hand side, you get the
partial of r with respect to

133
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,120
s is equal to this times ds.

134
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,190
I'll do ds in maybe pink.

135
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,770
Times ds-- this is just
a regular differential,

136
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,890
super small change in s.

137
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,220
This is a kind of a partial,
with respect to s.

138
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,740
That's going to be equal to--
well, if you multiply this side

139
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,230
of the equation times ds, this
guy's going to disappear.

140
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,700
So it's going to be r of s,
plus our super small change

141
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,080
in s, t minus r of s and t.

142
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,020
Now let me put a little
square around this.

143
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,650
This is going to be valuable
for us in the next video.

144
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,980
We're going to actually think
about what this means and how

145
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,210
to visualize this on a surface.

146
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,380
As you can imagine, this
is a vector right here.

147
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,260
You have 2 vector valued
functions and you're

148
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,990
taking the difference.

149
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,440
And we're going to visualize
it in the next video.

150
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,760
It's going to really help
us with surface integrals.

151
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,270
By the same exact logic, we
can do everything we did

152
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,140
here with s, we can do
it with t, as well.

153
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,960
So we can define the partial--
I'll draw a little-- I can

154
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,650
define the partial of r with
respect-- let me do it in a

155
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,080
different color, completely
different color.

156
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,270
It's orange.

157
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,580
The partial of r with respect
to t-- the definition

158
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,370
is just right here.

159
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:46,750
The limit as delta t approaches
0 of r of s t plus delta

160
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,100
t minus r of s and t.

161
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,770
In this situation we're
holding the s, you can

162
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,880
imagine, in constant.

163
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,220
We're finding its change in
t, all of that over delta t.

164
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,380
And the same thing falls out.

165
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,270
This is equal to the partial of
x with respect to ti plus y

166
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,580
with respect to tj, plus
z with respect to tk.

167
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,190
Same exact thing, you just kind
of swap the s's and the t's.

168
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,740
And by that same logic,
you'd have the same

169
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,990
result but in terms of t.

170
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,970
If you do this pseudo mathy
thing that I did up here, then

171
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:25,680
you would get the partial of r
with respect to t times a super

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,800
small change in t. dt, our
t differential, you could

173
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:40,360
imagine, is equal to r of st
plus dt minus r of s and t.

174
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,010
So let's box these
two guys away.

175
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,340
And in the next video,
we're going to actually

176
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,790
visualize what these mean.

177
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,640
And sometimes, when you kind of
do a bunch of like, silly math

178
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,670
like this, you're always like,
all right, what is

179
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,240
this all about?

180
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,110
Remember, all I did is I said,
what does it mean to take the

181
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,540
derivative of this with
respect to s or t?

182
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,970
Played around with it a little
bit, I got this result.

183
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,220
These 2 are going to be very
valuable for us, I think, in

184
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,870
getting the intuition for
why surface integrals

185
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,450
look the way they do.
