What I want to do in this video is tackle a problem that would be considered

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pretty difficult for most first year physics students and you frankly probably

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
wouldn't be expected to solve a problem like this in most

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
first physics classes or if your in an advanced or honors class, you might

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
be expected to, or it might be bonus problem but its an interesting type of problem

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because what were going to do is launch a projectile

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on an incline, so maybe were on a side of hill

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so its a hill, let me do it in green.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Were on the side of a hill like this, and lets say we know the inclination of

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the hill; the hill's inclination is 30 degrees

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
off the horizontal

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is the horizontal right over here. So that is the

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
inclination of the hill. And then we are going to launch a projectile

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at 10 meters per second.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are going to launch it at 10 meters per second

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the angle with the hill is 15 degrees

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so at a 15 degree angle with the hill.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the reason that this is more difficult than the traditional projectile motion problems is

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well we could think about it, the projectile is going to be launched and it is

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
eventually going to land at some point on the hill. But we can't do the
