1
00:00:00,144 --> 00:00:05,221
Let's say that I have a huge frozen over lake, or maybe it is a big pond.

2
00:00:05,236 --> 00:00:07,944
So I have a huge surface of ice over here.

3
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:10,713
This is my best attempt at drawing a flat surface of ice.

4
00:00:10,713 --> 00:00:14,200
And I am going to put two blocks of ice here.

5
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:18,471
So I'm going to put one block of ice just like this,

6
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:21,436
one block of ice right over here

7
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:30,010
and then I'm going to put another block of ice right here.

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,046
And these blocks of ice are identical.

9
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:41,918
They are both 5 kilograms. Let me write this down

10
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:45,498
or both of their masses, I should say, are are 5 kilograms.

11
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:48,108
And the only difference between the two

12
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:50,587
is that relative to the pond

13
00:00:50,603 --> 00:01:01,098
this one is stationary, and this one is moving with a constant velocity.

14
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:06,175
A constant velocity in the rightwards direction.

15
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:13,225
And lets say that its constant velocity is at 5 meters per second.

16
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:16,985
And the whole reason that I made blocks of ice on top of ice,

17
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:19,815
is because we are going to assume, at least for the sake of this video,

18
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:22,608
that friction is negligible.

19
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:25,400
Now what does Newtons first law of motion tell us

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,113
about something that is either not in motion,

21
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:32,025
or you can view this as having a constant velocity of zero,

22
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,652
or something that has a constant velocity.

23
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:36,410
Well, Newton's first law says,

24
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,771
they are going to either keep their constant velocity or stay stationary,

25
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:43,595
which
is a constant velocity of zero

26
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:45,831
unless there is some unbalance,

27
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:49,336
unless there is some net force acting on an object.

28
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:50,810
So lets just think about it here.

29
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,513
In either of these situations there must not be any unbalanced force acting on them

30
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:58,164
or there must not be any net force.

31
00:01:58,164 --> 00:02:01,379
But think about it, if we are assuming that these things are on earth,

32
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,215
there is a net force acting on both of them.

33
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:08,118
Both of them are on the surface of the Earth,

34
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:15,467
and they both have mass. So there will be the force of gravity acting down on them

35
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:21,933
There is going to be the downward force of gravity on both of these blocks of ice.

36
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:26,400
And that downward force of gravity is going to be equal to

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,999
the gravitational field near the surface of the Earth

38
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:39,067
Times, which is a vector, times the mass of the object. So time 5 kilograms.

39
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:46,800
This right over here is 9.8 meters per second squared

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,282
So you multiply that times 5, you get 49 kilogram meters per second squared

41
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:55,098
which is the same thing as 49 Newtons.

42
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:57,308
So this is a little bit of a conundrum here!

43
00:02:57,308 --> 00:03:00,631
Newton's first law says,

44
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:04,395
an object at rest will stay at rest, or an object in motion will stay in motion,

45
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:07,966
unless there is some unbalanced or net force

46
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:12,744
but based on what we have drawn right here, it looks like there is some sort of net force.

47
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:17,338
It looks like I have 49 Newtons of force pulling this thing downwards,

48
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:24,000
but you say, "No no Sal, obviously this thing won't start accelerating downwards

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,041
because there is ice here. It is resting on a big pool of frozen water."

50
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,533
So my answer to you is, well,

51
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:42,646
if that's your answer, then what is the resulting force that cancels out with gravity

52
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:49,456
to keep these blocks of ice from plummeting down to the core of the Earth?

53
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:56,000
From essentially free falling or accelerating down to the center of the Earth?

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,759
And you say, "Well, I guess these things would be falling if not for the ice,

55
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,923
the ice must be providing the counter acting force."

56
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:09,323
And you are absolutely correct.

57
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:15,323
The ice is providing the counter acting force in the opposite direction.

58
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:19,318
So the exact magnitude of force, and it is in the opposite direction.

59
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:25,954
And so if the force of gravity on each of these blocks are 49 Newtons downward,

60
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:31,133
it is completely netted off by the force of the ice on the block upwards,

61
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:36,913
and that will be a force of 49 Newtons upwards, in either case.

62
00:04:36,913 --> 00:04:40,938
And now hopefully it make sense that Newtons first law still holds.

63
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:44,210
We have no net force on this in the vertical direction.

64
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,098
Actually, no net force on this in either direction.

65
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,123
That is why they have a constant velocity.

66
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,636
This guy has a zero velocity in the horizontal direction,

67
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:55,441
this guy has a contant velocity in the horizontal direction.

68
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:58,329
and neither of them are accelerating in the vertical direction,

69
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:01,108
because you have force of ice on the block.

70
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:05,533
the ice supporting the block, that is completely contracting gravity.

71
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:11,102
And this force, in this example is called the normal force.

72
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,885
It is 49 Newtons upwards.

73
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:15,975
This right here is the normal force

74
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:19,867
and we will talk more about normal force in future videos

75
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:25,400
the normal force is the force when anything is resting on any surface, that is perpendicular to the surface.

76
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,452
and it will start to matter a lot when we start talking about friction.

77
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:32,969
We will see in future videos that when you have something on an incline,

78
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,541
lets say I have a block on an incline like this.

79
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:44,067
The normal force from the wedge on this block is going to be perpendicular to the surface.

80
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:47,985
And if you really think about what is happening here it is fundamentally in electromagnetic force

81
00:05:47,985 --> 00:06:02,656
because if you really zoom in on the molecules of the ice, or even better, the atoms of the ice.

82
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:07,200
What is keeping this top block of ice from falling down,

83
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:14,467
is that in order for it to go through, it's molecule would have to compress against

84
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:20,800
or get closer to the water molecules or individual atoms in this ice down here.

85
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,344
And the atoms, let me draw it on an atomic level right here.

86
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:32,449
Let me draw one of this guys molecules

87
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:39,646
So you have an oxygen with two hydrogens,

88
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:44,890
and it forms this big lattice structure. And we can talk more of that in the chemistry play list

89
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,964
and lets talk about one of this ice's molecules

90
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:54,882
So maybe it looks something like this and it has it's two hydrogens

91
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,175
and so what is keeping these two guys from getting compressed,

92
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,641
what is keeping this block of ice from going down further

93
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:06,308
is the repulsion between the electrons in this molecule and the electrons in that molecule.

94
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:10,005
So on a macro level, we view this as kind of a contact force

95
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:17,944
but on a microscopic level or an atomic level, it is really just electromagnetic repulsion at work.
