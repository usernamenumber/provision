1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,090
In the last video, we showed
that the squared error between

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:10,060
some line, y equals mx plus
b and each of these n data

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,460
points is this expression
right over here.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,290
In this video, I'm really just
going to algebraically

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,190
manipulate this expression so
that it's ready for the

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,070
calculus state.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,000
So we can actually optimize, we
can actually find the m and

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,520
b values that minimize this
value right over here.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,500
So this is just going to be a
ton of algebraic manipulation.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,170
But I'll try to color code
it well so we don't

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,030
get lost in the math.

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,300
So let me just rewrite this
expression over here.

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,370
So this whole video is just
going to be rewriting this

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,430
over and over again.

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,640
Just simplifying it a
bit with algebra.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,770
So this first term right over
here, y1 minus mx1 plus b

18
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,400
squared, this is all going
to be the squared

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,500
error of the line.

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,370
So this first term over here,
I'll keep it in blue, is going

21
00:00:52,370 --> 00:01:03,800
to be if we just expand it, y1
squared minus 2 times y1 times

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:12,970
mx1 plus b, plus mx1
plus b squared.

23
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,930
All I did is I just squared
this binomial right here.

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,480
You can imagine if this was a
minus b, it would be a squared

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,720
minus 2ab plus b squared.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,880
That's all I did.

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,860
Now I'll just have to do that
for each of the terms. And

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,720
each term is only different by
the x and the y coordinates

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,410
right over here.

30
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,530
And I'll go down so that we
can kind of combine like

31
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,070
terms. So this term over here
squared is going to be y2

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:45,220
squared minus 2 times
y2 times mx2 plus b

33
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,680
plus mx2 plus b squared.

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,000
Same exact thing up here.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,330
Except now it was with x2 and
y2, as opposed to x1 and y1.

36
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,660
And then we're just going to
keep doing that n times.

37
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,170
   

38
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,780
We're going to do it for the
third, x3, y3, keep going,

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,220
keep going.

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,610
All the way until we get the
this nth term over here.

41
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,640
And this nth term over here when
we square it is going to

42
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:22,340
be yn squared minus 2yn
times mxn plus b,

43
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,640
plus mxn plus b squared.

44
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,610
Now, the next thing I want to
do is actually expand these

45
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,130
out a little bit more.

46
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,130
So let's actually scroll down.

47
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,800
So this whole expression, I'm
just going to rewrite it, is

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,670
the same thing as-- and remember
this is just the

49
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,960
squared error of the line.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,830
So let me rewrite this
top line over here.

51
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,920
This top line over here
is y1 squared.

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,400
And then I'm going to
distribute this 2y1.

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,740
So this is going to be
minus 2y1mx1, that's

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,220
just that times that.

55
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,470
Minus 2y1b.

56
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,770
   

57
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,840
And then plus, and now let's
expand mx1 plus b squared.

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,950
So that's going to be m squared
x1 squared, plus 2

59
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:23,520
times mx1 times b
plus b squared.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,770
All I did, if was a plus b
squared, this is a squared

61
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,330
plus 2ab plus b squared.

62
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,340
And we're going to do that for
each of these terms. Or for

63
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,370
each of these colors, I
guess you could say.

64
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,480
So now let's move to
the second term.

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,750
It's going to be
the same thing.

66
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,620
But instead of y1's and
x1's, it's going

67
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,530
to be y2's and x2's.

68
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:52,410
So it is y2 squared minus
2y2mx2 minus 2y2b plus m

69
00:03:52,410 --> 00:04:01,280
squared x2 squared, plus 2 times
mx2b plus b squared.

70
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
And we're going to keep
doing this all the way

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,450
to get the nth term.

72
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,960
   

73
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,690
I guess color we should say.

74
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,755
So this is going to be yn
squared minus 2ynmxn.

75
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:22,750
   

76
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,160
And you don't even
have to think.

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,230
You just have to kind of
substitute these with n's now.

78
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,260
We could actually
look at this.

79
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,760
But it's going to be the
exact same thing.

80
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:39,190
Minus 2ynb plus m squared
xn squared, plus

81
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,920
2mxnb plus b squared.

82
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,340
So once again, this is just the
squared error of that line

83
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,320
with n points.

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,270
Between those n points and the
line y equals mx plus b.

85
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,200
So let's see if we can simplify
this somehow.

86
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,390
And to do that what I'm going to
do is I'm going to kind of

87
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,300
try to add up a bunch
of these terms here.

88
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,880
So if I were to add up all of
these terms right here, if I

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,060
were to add up this
column right over

90
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,420
there, what do I get?

91
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:22,300
It's going to be y1 squared plus
y2 squared all the way to

92
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,230
all the way to yn squared.

93
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,570
That's those terms
right over there.

94
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,180
So I'm going to have that.

95
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:37,800
And then have this common
2m amongst all of

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
these terms over here.

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,960
So let me write that down.

98
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,920
So then you have this 2m
here, 2m here, 2m here.

99
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,210
Let me put parentheses
around here.

100
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,300
So you have these terms
all added up.

101
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:58,690
Then you have minus 2m times all
of these terms. Actually,

102
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,510
let me color code it so you
see what we're doing.

103
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,580
I want to be very careful
with this math so

104
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,040
nothing seems too confusing.

105
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,120
Although this is really just
algebraic manipulation.

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,440
If I had all of these up, I get
y1 squared plus y2 squared

107
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,380
all the way to yn squared.

108
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,080
I'll put some parentheses
around that.

109
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,410
And then to that, we have this
common term, we have this

110
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,460
minus 2m, minus 2m, minus 2m.

111
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,680
And so we can distribute
those out.

112
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,890
And so I should actually
write it like this.

113
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,150
So we have a minus 2m, once we
distribute it out up here,

114
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,080
we're just going to be
left with a y1x1.

115
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,350
Or maybe I can call
it an x1y1.

116
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,580
   

117
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,860
That's that over there with
the 2m factored out.

118
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,360
   

119
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,015
Let me do that in
another color.

120
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:52,960
I want to make this
easy to read.

121
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,070
Plus x2y2.

122
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,320
Plus xnyn.

123
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,790
   

124
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,206
Well we're going to keep adding
up-- we're going to do

125
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,660
this n times.

126
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,770
All the way to plus xnyn.

127
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,030
This last term over here,
ynxn, same thing.

128
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,430
So that's the sum.

129
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,860
So this stuff over here, the sum
of all of this stuff right

130
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:26,960
over here, is the same thing as
this term right over here.

131
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,330
And then we have to sum
this right over here.

132
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,510
And you see again, we can factor
out here a minus 2b out

133
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:50,350
of all of these terms. So we
have minus 2b times y1 plus y2

134
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,180
plus all the way to to yn.

135
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,780
   

136
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,670
So this business.

137
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,880
These terms right over here,
when you add them up, give you

138
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,650
these terms, or this term,
right over there.

139
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,840
And let's just keep going.

140
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,420
And in the next video, we're
probably going to run out of

141
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,250
time in this one, I'll simplify
this more and clean

142
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,370
up the algebra a good bit.

143
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,260
So then the next term, what
is this going to be?

144
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,190
Same drill.

145
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,100
We can factor out
an m squared.

146
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:31,750
So we have m squared times
times x1 squared plus x2

147
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,650
squared-- actually, I want to
color code them, I forgot to

148
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,900
color code these over here.

149
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,890
   

150
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:48,140
Plus all the way
to xn squared.

151
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,200
Let me color code these.

152
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,060
This was a yn squared.

153
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,600
And this over here
was a y2 squared.

154
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,150
So this is exactly this.

155
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:04,900
So in this last step we just
did, this thing over here is

156
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,230
this thing right over here.

157
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,340
And of course we
have to add it.

158
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,980
So I'll put a plus out front.

159
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,360
We're almost done with this
stage of the simplification.

160
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:19,130
So over here, we have a common
2mb, so let's put a plus 2mb

161
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:30,370
times, once again, x1 plus x2
plus all the way to xn.

162
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:36,450
   

163
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:43,730
So this term right over here
this is the exact same thing

164
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,540
as this term over here.

165
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,610
And then finally, we have a b
squared in each of these.

166
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,720
And how many of these b
squared do we have?

167
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,850
Well we have n of these
lines, right?

168
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,050
This is the first line, second
line, then bunch, bunch, bunch

169
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,570
all the way to the nth line.

170
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,170
So we have b squared added
to itself n times.

171
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:06,320
So this right over here is
just b squared n times.

172
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,560
So we'll just write that as
plus n times b squared.

173
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,120
Let me remind ourselves what
this is all about.

174
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,960
This is all just algebraic
manipulation of the squared

175
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,270
error between those n points
and the line y

176
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,350
equals mx plus b.

177
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,540
It doesn't look like I've
simplified it much.

178
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,020
And I'm going to stop in
the video right now.

179
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,080
In the next video, we're just
going to take off right here

180
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,730
and try to simplify
this thing.

181
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,267
