1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:05,800
According to the pictograph below, how many survey respondents

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,467
have type O positive blood ? How many have O negative blood ?

3
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:16,133
So pictograph is really just a way of representing data with pictures that are

4
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,667
somehow related to the data

5
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:21,467
So in this case they give us little pictures of am assuming blood drops

6
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:22,533
right over here

7
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:23,800
And they tell us

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,533
each blood drop

9
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:28,867
each blood drop in this pictograph represents 8 people

10
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:30,533
so you can kinda view that as the scale of these graphs

11
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,267
Each of this is 8 people

12
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:33,200
So, For Example

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,067
You say how many people have A positive would be

14
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:39,800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6 , 7 blood drops

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,785
but each of those blood drops represent 8 people, so it would be 56

16
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:46,605
people have type A positive

17
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:49,164
But, lets answer the actual question that they are asking us

18
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,467
How many survey respondents have type O positive

19
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:53,800
O Positive

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,800
So this is O and then we care about O positive

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,333
So we have, 1 blood drop, 2, 3

22
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,067
Let me just do this in a new different color.

23
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:09,133
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

24
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,667
So we have 8 drops

25
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,933
I'll put those in quotes cause of the pictures of drops

26
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,800
and then the scale is,the scale is 8 people. 8 people

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,067
Let me write it this way

28
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,600
Times 8 people per drop

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,800
8 people per drop

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,600
and so, 8 times and 8 and actually the drops you can view them as cancelling out

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,733
if you view them as units

32
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:32,933
so drops, drops

33
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:35,267
8 times 8 is equal to 64

34
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:37,533
64 people

35
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:40,333
So they could have literally written the number 64 right over here

36
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,600
64 People have type O positive blood

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,933
So now lets think about the O negative case

38
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:48,000
O negative blood

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,600
Well this is O and then within the blood group O

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,200
This is O negative

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,733
and we have 1 drop, 2 drops

42
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,933
So we have 2 drops

43
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,133
Two Drops

44
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:02,200
Times 8 people per drop

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,267
8 people per drop

46
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:06,000
so 2 times 8.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,267
each of these represent 8

48
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:08,400
So 8 and then 16

49
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,200
Or, 2 times 8 is equal to 16, 16 people

50
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,000
so 16 of the survey respondents

51
00:02:15,000 --> 99:59:59,999
16 have type O negative and 64 have type O positive
