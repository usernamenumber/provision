1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,189
If we want to get the upside of owning a stock

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:07,300
while still mitigating the downside in case the stock price goes down

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,861
We saw that we could buy a stock and an appropriate put option

4
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:14,959
so that when the stock goes below some price

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:18,389
the put option starts to have value and so it mitigates our downside

6
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:23,351
And just as a review, these payoff diagrams are the values of, or at least the one on the left,

7
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:26,143
is the value of holdings at some future date

8
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:31,547
and we are defining that date to be the maturity date of the options under question

9
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:35,152
Now, and this one over here is the profit at that maturity date

10
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:39,230
and that's why we are subtracting the actual costs to enter the position on this one on the right

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:47,380
Now the question I want to answer in this video is, "How can we get the same payoff diagram without buying either stocks or puts?"

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,310
and as a bit of a clue, think about what happens if we were to just buy a call option

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,614
actually let me do it in that same color

14
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:58,079
So if you were to just have a call option, the payoff diagram would look like this.

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,396
You would never exercise the call option at expiration

16
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,723
unless, and we're assuming this is at expiration or at maturity,

17
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:12,397
but if the stock price goes above $50, you would then exercise your option to buy it at $50

18
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:16,749
So then it starts to have value as the stock price goes above $50

19
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:21,997
If the stock price goes to $60, you would exercise your option to buy at $50 and then you could sell at $60

20
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:24,063
and you would make $10

21
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:27,047
So you start to get some of the upside

22
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:31,115
So how can we shift this graph up to get exactly the same payoff diagram?

23
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:40,191
Well, we could have a call option and we could own something that would essentially shift this entire graph up by $50

24
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:58,014
So we could have, essentially, a $50 bond, or a bond that is worth, let me write it this way, a bond that is worth $50 at option expiration

25
00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:02,164
So if there's some interest we're getting, we might be able to buy it for a little bit less

26
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:06,180
If there's zero interest, then it's pretty much like cash and we would pay $50 for it

27
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:13,030
But the payoff diagram for a bond that will be worth $50 at this date, at maturity, or at expiration

28
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,997
The payoff diagram for just the bond would look like this. It would just a straight line.

29
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:20,047
It's guaranteed to pay you $50

30
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:29,412
So if you own the bond and the call option, below $50 the call option is worthless, so you're just going to have the bond over here

31
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:35,031
And then, above $50, you still have the bond, but now the call option is worth something

32
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:37,397
So you have the value of the bond plus the call option

33
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:42,747
So at $60, the call option is worth $10. The bond is worth $50. The combination is worth $60

34
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:46,496
And so the combination of the call option plus the bond, you see it here on the left,

35
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:52,130
it's actually going to have the same payoff diagram as the stock plus the put

36
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,880
So you have the situation here that the stock plus an appropriately priced put

37
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,580
or a put with the appropriate strike price is going to be the same thing

38
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:10,249
when it comes to payoff at a future date, at expiration, as a bond plus a call option

39
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:13,329
And this right here is called "Put-Call Parity"

40
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,747
and it shows the relationship between all of these different securities

41
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:31,310
and if any of these prices start to, kind of, not make this thing hold true, there might be an arbitrage opportunity, but we'll cover that in future videos.
