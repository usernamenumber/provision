1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
   

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,010
Say I live in a country of a 100
million people and there's

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,500
a presidential election
coming up.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,570
And in that presidential
election there are two

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,109
candidates.

6
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:16,250
There's candidate A,
and candidate B.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,800
And there's some reality-- let's
say I live in a very

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,060
decisive country and everyone is
going to vote for either--

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,300
and everyone participates in
election and everyone is going

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,530
to vote for either candidate
A or candidate B.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,410
And so there's some percentage,
there's some

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,170
reality there, that p-- let me
write it over here-- maybe 1

13
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,460
minus p percent-- let me do
the p first. There's some

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,600
reality that maybe p percent
will vote for B, and I could

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,820
switch them around
if I wanted.

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,060
So p percent are going to vote
for B, and the rest of the

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,960
people are going to vote for A,
so maybe 1 minus p percent

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,690
are going to vote for A.

19
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,400
And you might already recognize
that this is a

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,890
Bernoulli Distribution.

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,070
There's one of two values
for a sample I can get.

22
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,660
And right here, the values I
said you're either voting for

23
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,750
candidate A or you're voting
for candidate B.

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,220
It's very hard to deal
with those values.

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,790
You can't calculate a mean
between A and B and all of

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,700
that-- those are letters,
they're not numbers.

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,620
So to make it manipulatable
mathematically we're going to

28
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,380
say sampling someone who's
going to vote for A is

29
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,070
equivalent to sampling a 0,
and sampling someone who's

30
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,900
going to vote for B is
equivalent to sampling a 1.

31
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,420
And if you do that with a
Bernoulli Distribution, we

32
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,220
learned in the video on
Bernoulli Distributions, that

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:39,690
the mean of this distribution
right here is going to be

34
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,750
equal to p.

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,090
And it's a pretty
straightforward proof for how

36
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,690
we got that.

37
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,230
So the mean of this
distribution, which will

38
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,260
actually be not a value that
this distribution can take on,

39
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,850
is going to be some place over
here and it is going to be

40
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,260
equal to p.

41
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,830
Now my country has a
100 million people.

42
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,470
It is practically, or is
definitely impossible for me

43
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,840
to be able to go and ask all
100 million people who are

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,100
they going to vote for.

45
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,420
So I won't be able to exactly
figure out what these

46
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,630
parameters are going to be.

47
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,570
What my mean is, what
p is going to be.

48
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,910
But instead of doing that, what
I'm going to do is do a

49
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,140
random survey.

50
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,450
I'm going to sample this
population, look at that data,

51
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,990
and then get an estimate
of what p really is.

52
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,430
Because this is what I
really care about.

53
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,740
I really care about p.

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,240
So I'm going to try to estimate
p with a sample, and

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,690
then we're also going to think
about how good of an

56
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,670
estimate that is.

57
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:46,360
So I am going to randomly
survey, or sample, 100 people.

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,300
And let's say I got the
following results.

59
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:56,710
Let's say that 57 people say
that they were going to vote

60
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,875
for person A.

61
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,020
Let me write it this way.

62
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,350
So 57 people say they're going
to vote for A, or that's

63
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,260
equivalent to getting
57 samples of 0.

64
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,650
And then the rest of the people,
once again, very

65
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,000
decisive population, no one is
undecided, the rest of the

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,960
people, so 43 people say they're
going to vote for B.

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,540
Or that's the equivalent
of sampling 43 1's.

68
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,430
Now given this sample here, what
is my sample mean and my

69
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,400
sample variance?

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,180
My sample mean right here, well
that's just going to be

71
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,150
the average of these 0's and
1's So I've got 57 0's, so

72
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,630
it's going to be 57 times
0 plus my 43 1's.

73
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,700
So the sum of all of my samples,
so it's 43 1's, plus

74
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,890
43 times 1, over the total
number of samples

75
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,940
I took, over 100.

76
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,900
So what does this get me?

77
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,040
So 57 times 0 is 0.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,690
43 times 1 divided
by 100 is 0.43.

79
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,920
That is my sample mean, the
mean of just the 100 data

80
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,520
points that I actually got.

81
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,070
Now what is my sample
variance?

82
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,990
   

83
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:25,450
Sample variance is going to be
equal to the sum of my squared

84
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,070
distances to the mean divided
by my samples minus 1.

85
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,770
Remember, this is a sample
variance, and we want to get

86
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,270
the best estimator of the real
variance of this distribution.

87
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,220
And to do that you don't divide
by 100, you're going to

88
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,710
divide by 100 minus 1.

89
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,610
We learned that many,
many videos ago.

90
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,710
So I have 57.

91
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,530
So I had 57 samples of 0.

92
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,510
We'll do it in that same
yellow color--

93
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,400
57 samples of 0.

94
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,230
And so each of those samples
are 0 minus 0.43

95
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,090
away from the mean.

96
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,740
Each of those samples are 0.

97
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,650
You subtract 0.43-- this
is the difference

98
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,380
between 0 and 0.43.

99
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,140
And if I want the squared
distance, I square it-- that's

100
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,220
how we calculate variance.

101
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,950
There's 57 of those.

102
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,780
And then there's 43 times that
I sampled a 1 in my sample

103
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,540
population-- 43 times I sampled
a 1, and the 1 is 1

104
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,300
minus 0.43 away from the mean
because that is the mean, and

105
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,430
I want to square
that distance.

106
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,860
And then I don't want to
just divide it by n.

107
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,860
I don't want to just divided by
100-- remember, I'm trying

108
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,730
to estimate the true
population mean.

109
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,160
In order for this to be the best
estimator of that, and I

110
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,720
gave you the intuition of why
many, many videos ago, we

111
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,190
divide by 100 minus 1 or 99.

112
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,830
Let's get the calculator out
to actually figure out our

113
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,270
sample variance.

114
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:59,160
So let me get the calculator
out, and we have-- I'll do the

115
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:12,880
numerator first. I have 57 times
0 minus 0.43 squared,

116
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:27,430
plus 43 times 1 minus
0.43 squared.

117
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:33,050
And then all of that divided
by 100 minus 1, or 99--

118
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,210
divided by 99 is equal
to 0.2475.

119
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:46,380
So my variance, my sample
variance, is equal to 0.2475.

120
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,120
And if I want to figure out my
sample standard deviation I

121
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,760
just take the square
root of that.

122
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,420
My sample standard deviation is
just going to be the square

123
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,710
root of my sample variance.

124
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,650
So I take the square root of
that value that I just had,

125
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,730
which is 0.497.

126
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,900
So actually let me just
round that up as 0.50.

127
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:15,270
So my sample standard
deviation is 0.50.

128
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,590
Now if you just look at this,
you say OK, well your best

129
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,470
estimate of the percentage of
people voting for A or B is

130
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,630
really what you just saw here.

131
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,180
Your best estimate or your best
estimate of the mean is

132
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,420
that 43% of people are going
to vote for B and everyone

133
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,190
else is going to vote for A.

134
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,740
But an interesting question
is how good a

135
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,120
of a sample is that?

136
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,230
Let's take it to
the next level.

137
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,820
Let's try to think of an
interval around 43% for which

138
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,860
we are 95%, that we're
reasonably confident, roughly

139
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,480
95% sure that the real mean
is in that interval.

140
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,960
Let me make it very clear.

141
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,790
Let me draw.

142
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,810
So when we get our sample mean
we are sampling from the

143
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,930
sampling distribution of
the sampling mean.

144
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,800
Let me draw that.

145
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,890
The sampling distribution
of the sample mean.

146
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,210
So since we're sampling from a
discrete distribution it's

147
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,460
actually going to be a discrete
distribution, but

148
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,540
it's going to have 100
possible values.

149
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,270
This can take on 100 different
values here.

150
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,180
Really anything between
0 and 1.

151
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,780
But I'll draw it kind of
continuous because it would be

152
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,260
hard for me to draw 100
different bars.

153
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,260
If I did, you'd have a bar
there, you'd have a bar there.

154
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,440
The odds that your sample mean
would be 1, it would be a very

155
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,940
low probability, and then you
would have one more bar, a bar

156
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,280
like that, a bar like
that, but that

157
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,090
takes forever to draw.

158
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,390
So I'm just going to approximate
it with this

159
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,210
normal curve right over there.

160
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,330
So the sampling distribution
of the sample mean-- let me

161
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,600
write it over here.

162
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,870
So this is the sampling
distribution

163
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,600
of the sample mean.

164
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,950
   

165
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,940
It has some mean here.

166
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,040
   

167
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,230
It has a mean, and I can denote
it with the mu sub x

168
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,080
bar-- this tells us this is
the mean of the sample

169
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,970
distribution.

170
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,680
But we know from many, many
videos that this is going to

171
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,540
be the same thing as the mean of
the population mean that we

172
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,030
are sampling from, that each
sample comes from, each of

173
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,820
these 100 samples come from.

174
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,370
So this is going to be equal
to mu, which is going to be

175
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,620
equal to p.

176
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,020
   

177
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,760
Now this variance over here,
the variance of this

178
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,470
distribution-- let me draw it
like this, or even better

179
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,880
let's do the standard
deviation of this

180
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,270
distribution.

181
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,150
The standard deviation of this
distribution, that distance

182
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:01,470
right over here, the standard
deviation of the sampling

183
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,110
distribution of the sample
mean-- we've seen it multiple

184
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,370
times already-- it's going to
be this standard deviation--

185
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,690
it's going to be the standard
deviation of our population

186
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,690
distribution.

187
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,040
So that standard deviation
is going to be that

188
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,370
distance over there.

189
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,790
So there's some standard
deviation associated with this

190
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,730
distribution.

191
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,690
It's going to be that standard
deviation divided by the

192
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,140
square root of our
sample size.

193
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,680
And we saw many videos ago why
that, at least experimentally

194
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,430
makes sense, or why it
intuitively makes sense.

195
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,850
So it's going to be the
square root of 100.

196
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,740
So it's going to be this
guy divided by 10.

197
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,130
Now we do not know
what this guy is.

198
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,190
The only way to figure out
what that guy is is to

199
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,060
actually survey 100 million
people, which would have been

200
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,010
impossible.

201
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,010
So to estimate the standard
deviation of this, we will use

202
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:59,490
our sampling standard deviation
as our best estimate

203
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,190
for the population standard
deviation.

204
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,820
So we could say-- and remember,
this is an estimate.

205
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,020
We cannot come up with the exact
number for this just

206
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,710
from a sample.

207
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,020
But we can estimate it.

208
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,400
Because this is our best
estimator for this standard

209
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,040
deviation, and if we divide it
by 10, we will have our best

210
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,100
estimator for the standard
deviation of the sampling

211
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,500
distribution of the
sampling mean.

212
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,040
So remember, this is
just an estimate.

213
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,870
It is just an estimate.

214
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,780
So you kind of have to take
everything after this point

215
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,980
with a little bit of
a grain of salt.

216
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,300
So it's going to be roughly
equal to or an estimate of it

217
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,550
is going to be 0.5.

218
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,125
   

219
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,040
And remember, every time we take
a different sample from

220
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,550
here this number is
going to change.

221
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,630
So this isn't like something
in stone.

222
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,710
This is dependent
on our sample.

223
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,720
So it's going to wiggle around a
little bit depending on what

224
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,980
numbers we actually
get in our sample.

225
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,220
But it's going to be 0.50.

226
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,840
This is the s right here, this
0.50 divided by 10, which is

227
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,300
equal to 0.05.

228
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,320
So our best estimate of this
standard deviation is 0.05, or

229
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,380
you could even view it as 5%.

230
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,670
Now what I want to do is come up
with an interval around the

231
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:20,220
sample mean where I'm reasonably
confident using all

232
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,910
my estimates and all that that
there's a-- let me say I'm

233
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,820
really confident that there's
a 95% chance that the true

234
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:38,100
mean is within two standard
deviations-- or let me put it

235
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,260
this way, there's a 95%
chance that the true

236
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,460
mean is in that interval.

237
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,920
So let me write this down.

238
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:58,790
I want to find an interval
such that I am reasonably

239
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:06,550
confident-- and I'm putting
this kind of touchy-feely

240
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,140
language over here because it's
all around the fact that

241
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,650
I don't know for a fact that
the standard deviation is

242
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,540
0.05, I'm just estimating.

243
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:28,810
But I'm reasonably confident
that there is a 95% chance

244
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:35,300
that the true mean of the
population, which is the same

245
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,830
thing as the proportion of the
population who are going to

246
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,270
vote for person B, or the
proportion of the population

247
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,170
that are going to be a 1.

248
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,070
So this is also, we just
have to remember that

249
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,940
mu is equal to p.

250
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,770
That there's a 95% chance
that the true

251
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,762
p is in that interval.

252
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:04,200
And actually, since I've already
gone 14 minutes into

253
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,630
this video, I'm going to pause
this video, I'm going to stop

254
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,110
this video here, and maybe I'll
even let you think about

255
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,770
it just based on everything
we've done so far.

256
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,470
We figured out the sample mean--
sorry, we figured out

257
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,420
the sample mean right
over here.

258
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,035
We've figured out an estimate
for the-- and remember, this

259
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:22,860
is just a sampling mean.

260
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,850
We don't know the true-- this
is the mean of our sample.

261
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,740
We don't know the true mean of
the sampling distribution, and

262
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,500
we also don't know the true
standard deviation of the

263
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,420
sampling distribution.

264
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,490
But we were able to estimate
it with the

265
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,660
sample standard deviation.

266
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,170
Now everything that we have so
far, and based on what we've

267
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,990
seen before on confidence
intervals and all that, how

268
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,820
can we find an interval such
that roughly-- and I'm saying

269
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,340
roughly because we had to
estimate the standard

270
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,070
deviation-- that there's a 95%
chance that the true mean of

271
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,750
our population, or the p, the
proportion of the population

272
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,790
saying 1, is in that interval?

273
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,980
And we're going to do that
in the next video.
