1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,121
Determine the six trigonometric ratios

2
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:07,870
for angle A in the right triangle below

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,465
so this right over here is angle A, it's at vertex A.

4
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:14,530
And to help me remember the definitions of the trig ratios,

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,016
and these are human constructed definitions that have ended up being

6
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:22,502
very, very useful for analyzing a whole series

7
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:24,158
of things in the world.

8
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,517
To help me remember them, I use the word

9
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:28,273
SOH CAH TOA

10
00:00:28,273 --> 00:00:30,259
Let me write that down.

11
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:35,140
SOH CAH TOA

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,897
sometimes you can think of it as one word but

13
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:39,950
it's really the 3 parts that define at least

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,895
3 of the trig functions for you and then we

15
00:00:41,895 --> 00:00:44,231
can get the other 3 by looking at the first 3.

16
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:48,301
So SOH tells us that sine of an angle,

17
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:50,656
in this case it's sine of A,

18
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:53,611
So sine of A is equal to

19
00:00:53,611 --> 00:01:01,327
the opposite, that's the O, over the hypotenuse.

20
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,761
Well, in this context, what is the opposite to angle A?

21
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:08,961
Well, we go across the triangle, it opens up on to

22
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:11,951
side BC, it has length 12, so that is the opposite side.

23
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:15,311
So, this is going to be equal to twelve and

24
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:18,161
what's the hypotenuse?

25
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,211
Well, the hypotenuse is the longest side of the triangle.

26
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:23,809
It's opposite the 90 degree angle, and so we go

27
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,793
opposite the 90 degree angle,

28
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:28,719
longest side is side AB and it has length 13,

29
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,988
so this right over here is the hypotenuse.

30
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:35,107
So, the sine of A is 12/13.

31
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:37,632
So now let's go to CAH.

32
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:39,844
CAH defines cosine for us.

33
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:43,207
It tells us that cosine of an angle

34
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:46,724
in this case, cosine of A, is equal to

35
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:52,583
the adjacent side to the angle over the hypotenuse.

36
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:56,269
So, what's the adjacent side to angle A?

37
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:59,276
Well, if we look at angle A, there are two sides that are

38
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:02,298
next to it. One of them is the hypotenuse,

39
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:04,442
the other one has length 5.

40
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:07,750
The adjacent one is side CA, so it's 5 and

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,292
what is the hypotenuse? Well, we've already figure that out.

42
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:14,672
The hypotenuse is right over here

43
00:02:14,672 --> 00:02:16,961
it's opposite the 90 degree angle.

44
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:20,292
It's the longest side of the right triangle.

45
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:22,257
It has length 13. So the cosine of A is 5/13.

46
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:25,238
Let me label this right over here is the

47
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:27,343
adjacent side. And this is all specific to angle A.

48
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:30,501
The hypotenuse would be the same regardless

49
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:32,555
of the angle you pick but the opposite and

50
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:34,477
the adjacent is dependent on the angle that we

51
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:36,572
choose in the right angle.

52
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:39,006
Now, let's go to TOA. TOA defines tangent for us.

53
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,282
It tells us that the tangent of an angle

54
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:46,352
is equal to the opposite side over the adjacent side.

55
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:53,446
So, given this definition, what is the tangent of A?

56
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:57,422
The opposite side, we have already figured out,

57
00:02:57,422 --> 00:03:01,297
has length 12 and the adjacent side,

58
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:04,840
we've already figure out has length 5.

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,593
So the tangent of A, which is opposite over adjacent is 12/5.

60
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:08,630
Now, we'll go the to the other 3 trig ratios.

61
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:16,811
Which you can think of as the reciprocals of

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these 3, right over here. But I'll define it.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So first you have cosecant and cosecant is

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
always a little unintuitive why cosecant is

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the reciprocal of sine of A even though it

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
starts with a co like cosine.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But, cosecant is the reciprocal of the sine of A.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So sine of A is opposite over hypotenuse.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Cosecant of A is hypotenuse over opposite.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what's the hypotenuse over the opposite?

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, the hypotenuse is 13 and the opposite side is 12.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And notice that 13/12 is the reciprocal of 12/13.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, secant of A is the reciprocal, so instead

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of being adjacent over hypotenuse,

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which we got from the CAH part of SOH CAH TOA

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's the hypotenuse over adjacent.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, what is the secant of A?

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well the hypotenuse, we've figured out

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
multiple times already is 13.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what is the adjacent side?

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it's 13/5, which is once again is the

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
reciprocal of the cosine of A.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
5/13.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Finally, let's get the cotangent.

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent of A.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Instead of being opposite over adjacent

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it is adjacent over opposite.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what is the cotangent of A?

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we figured out the adjacent side multiple

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times for angle A.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's length 5.

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the opposite side to angle A is 12

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's 5/12. Which is, once again,

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the reciprocal of the tangent of A

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is 12/5.
