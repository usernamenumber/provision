1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I have got a rocket here.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this rocket is going to launch a projectile maybe its a rock of some kind.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
With a velocity of 10 meters per second.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the direction of that velocity is going to be 30 degrees.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
30 degrees upwards from the horizontal

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or the angle between direction of the launch

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the horizontal is 30 degrees.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what we wanna figure out

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in this video is how far does the rock travel?

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We wanna figure out how..how far does it travel?

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Does it travel?

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to simplify this problem what we are going to do

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is to break down this velocity vector into its vertical and horizontal components.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are going to use the vertical components.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me just draw it visually.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this velocity vector can be broken down into its vertical

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and its horizontal components.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And its horizontal components.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we are going to get some vertical component..

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some amount of velocity in the upwards direction.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we can use that to figure out how long

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will this rock stay in the air.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because it doesn't matter what its horizontal component is.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its vertical component is going to determine

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how quickly it decelerates due to gravity

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then reaccelerates and essentially how long it is going to be in air.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And once we figure out how long its in the air

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can multiply it by...

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can multiply by the horizontal component of the velocity

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that will tell us how far it travels.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And once again the assumption we are making in these video is

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that air resistance is negligible.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Obviously if there was significant air resistance this horizontal velocity

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
would not stay constant while its travelling through the air.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we are going to assume that it does.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That it does not change.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That it is negligible.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We can assume that we are doing this experiment on the moon.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we wanted to have a...

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we wanted it in purer terms.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But lets solve the problem.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the first thing we wanna do is to

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
breakdown this velocity vector

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we wanna breakdown this velocity vector

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that has a magnitude of 10 meters per second

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and has an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We wanna break it down into its x and y components.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So its horizontal and vertical components.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that its horizontal

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
draw a liitle bit better.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That its horizontal component amd its vertical components look like this.
