1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,740
In the last video, we set out
to figure out the surface area

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,410
of the walls of this
weird-looking building, where

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,880
the ceiling of the walls was
defined by the function f of xy

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,800
is equal to x plus y squared,
and then the base of this

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,030
building, or the contour of its
walls, was defined by the path

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,100
where we have a circle of
radius 2 along here, then we go

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,230
down along the y-axis, and then
we take another left, and we go

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,450
along the x-axis, and
that was our building.

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,790
And in the last video, we
figured out this first

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,830
wall's surface area.

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,570
In fact, you can think of it,
our original problem is, we

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,730
wanted to figure out the line
integral along the closed path,

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,360
so it was a closed line
integral, along the closed path

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:51,770
c of f of xy, and we're always
multiplying f of xy times a

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,720
little bit, a little, small
distance of our path, ds.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,550
We're writing this in the
most abstract way possible.

18
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,800
And what we saw in the last
video is, the easiest way to do

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,560
this is to break this up into
multiple paths, or into

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,990
multiple problems.

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,700
So you can imagine, this whole
contour, this whole path we

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,900
call c, but we could call this
part, we figured out in

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,330
the last video, c1.

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,430
This part we can call, let me
make a point, c2, and this

25
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,010
point right here is c3.

26
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,640
So we could redefine, or we can
break up, this line integral,

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,540
this closed-line integral, into
3 non-closed line integrals.

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,340
This will be equal to the line
integral along the path c1 of f

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:40,560
of xy ds, plus the line
integral along c2 of f of x y

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,900
ds plus the line integral, you
might have guessed it, along c3

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,930
of f of xy ds, and in the last
video, we got as far as

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,340
figuring out this first part,
this first curvy wall

33
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,490
all right here.

34
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,870
Its surface area, we figured
out, was 4 plus 2 pi.

35
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,960
Now we've got to figure
out the other 2 parts.

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,850
So let's do C2, let's do
this line integral next.

37
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,600
And in order to do it,
we need to do another

38
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,540
parameterization of x and y.

39
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,620
It's going to be different than
what we did for this part.

40
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,570
We're no longer along
this circle, we're

41
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,390
just along the y-axis.

42
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,570
So as long as we're there,
x is definitely going

43
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,750
to be equal to 0.

44
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,060
So that's my parameterization,
x is equal to 0.

45
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,070
If we're along the y-axis, x
is definitely equal to 0.

46
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,710
And then y, we could say it
starts off at y is equal to 2.

47
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:37,790
Maybe we'll say y is equal to 2
minus t, for t is between 0, t

48
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,230
is greater than or equal to
0, less than or equal to 2.

49
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,270
And that should work.

50
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,300
When t is equal to 0, we're at
this point right there, and

51
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,900
then as t increases towards 2,
we move down the y-axis, until

52
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,270
eventually when t is equal
to 2, we're at that

53
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,080
point right there.

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,780
So that's our parameterization.

55
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,530
And so let's evaluate this
line, and we could do our

56
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,250
derivatives, too, if we like.

57
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,920
What's the derivative,
I'll write it over here.

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,290
What's dx dt?

59
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,230
Pretty straightforward.

60
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:09,550
Derivative of 0 is 0, and
dy dt is equal to the

61
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,400
derivative of this.

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,930
It's just minus 1, right?

63
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,030
2 minus t, derivative of
minus t, is just minus 1.

64
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,940
And so let's just break it up.

65
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,540
So we have this thing right
here, so we have the

66
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,635
integral along c2.

67
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:28,490
But let's, instead of writing
c2, I'll leave c2 there, but

68
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:35,450
we'll say were going from t is
equal to 0 to 2 of f of xy.

69
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:42,690
f of xy is this thing right
here, is x plus y squared,

70
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,090
and then times ds.

71
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,420
   

72
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,410
And we know from the last
several videos, ds can be

73
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:57,350
rewritten as the square root of
dx dt squared, so 0 squared,

74
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,340
plus dy dt squared, so minus 1
squared is 1, all

75
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,910
of that times dt.

76
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,390
And obviously, this is
pretty nice and clean.

77
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,640
This is 0 plus 1, square
root, this just becomes 1.

78
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,260
And then what is x?

79
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,330
x, if we write it in terms of
our parameterization, is always

80
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,780
going to be equal to 0, and
then y squared is going to

81
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,280
be 2 minus is t squared.

82
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,490
So this is going to be
2 minus t squared.

83
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,020
So this whole crazy thing
simplified to, we're going to

84
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,240
go from t is equal to 0 to t is
equal to 2, the x disappears in

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,330
our parameterization, x just
stays 0, regardless of what

86
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,070
t is, and then you have y
squared, but y is the same

87
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:47,180
thing as 2 minus t, so 2 minus
t squared, and then you have

88
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,440
your dt sitting out there.

89
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,840
This is pretty straightforward.

90
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,910
I always find it easier when
you're finding an

91
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,780
antiderivative of this,
although you can do this in

92
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,610
your head, I like to
just actually multiply

93
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,720
out this binomial.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,340
So this is going to be equal to
the antiderivative from t is

95
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:16,230
equal to 0 to t is equal to 2
of 4 minus 2 minus 4t plus t

96
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,690
squared, plus t squared,
just like that dt.

97
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,290
And this is pretty
straightforward.

98
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,150
This is going to be, the
antiderivative of this is 4

99
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,750
t minus 2 t squared, right?

100
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,580
When you take the derivative,
there's 2 times minus 2 is

101
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:43,200
minus 4 t, and then you have
plus 1/3 t to the third, right?

102
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,190
These are just simple
antiderivatives, and we need

103
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,300
to evaluate it from 0 to 2.

104
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,180
And so let's evaluate it at 2.

105
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,140
4 times 2 is 8, let
me pick a new color.

106
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:02,560
4 times 2 is 8, minus 2 times 2
squared, so 2 times 4, so minus

107
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,800
8, plus 1/3 times 2
to the third power.

108
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,910
So 1/3 times 8.

109
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,970
So these cancel out.

110
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,530
We have 8 minus 8, and
we just have 8/3.

111
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,530
So this just becomes 8/3.

112
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,470
And then we have to put a 0 in,
minus 0 evaluate here, but

113
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,320
it's just going to be 0.

114
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,180
We have 4 times 0, two times 0,
all of these are going to be 0.

115
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,730
So minus 0.

116
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,700
So just like that, we
found our surface area

117
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,210
of our second wall.

118
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,250
This turned out being,
this right here is 8/3.

119
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,890
And now we have our last
wall, and then we can

120
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,380
just add them up.

121
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,640
So we have our last wall.

122
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,800
I'll do another
parameterization.

123
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,180
I want to have the graph there.

124
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,620
Well, maybe I can
paste it again.

125
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:46,990
Edit.

126
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,590
So there's the graph again.

127
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,250
And now we're going
to do our last wall.

128
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,870
So our last wall is this one
right here, which is, we

129
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,930
could write it, you
know, this was c3.

130
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,750
Let me switch colors here.

131
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,420
So this is c, we're going to go
along contour c3 of f of xy ds,

132
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,170
which is the same thing as,
let's do a parameterization.

133
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,580
Along this curve, if we just
say, x is equal to t, very

134
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,770
straight forward, for t is
greater than or equal to 0,

135
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,420
less than or equal to 2, and
this whole time that we're

136
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,520
along the x-axis, y is
going to be equal to 0.

137
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,650
That's pretty straightforward
parameterization.

138
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,100
So this is going to be equal
to, we're going to go from t is

139
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:37,845
equal to 0 to t is equal to 2
of f of xy, which is, I'll

140
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:41,860
write in terms of x right now,
x and y, x plus y

141
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,760
squared times ds.

142
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,970
Now, what is dx-- well, let
me write ds right here.

143
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,690
Times ds.

144
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,520
That's what we're dealing with.

145
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,870
Now we know what ds is.

146
00:07:52,870 --> 00:08:01,030
ds is equal to the square
root of dx dt squared plus

147
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,940
dy dt squared times dt.

148
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,510
We proved that in
the first video.

149
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,690
Or we didn't rigorously prove
it, but we got the sense

150
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,980
of why this is true.

151
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,560
And what's the derivative
of x with respect to t?

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,890
Well, that's just 1, so this
is just going to be a 1,

153
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,250
1 squared, same thing.

154
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,030
And the derivative of y
with respect to z is 0.

155
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,840
So this is is 0, 1 plus 0 is
1, square root of 1 is 1.

156
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,090
So this thing just becomes dt.

157
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,290
ds is going to be equal
to dt, in this case.

158
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,510
So this just becomes a dt.

159
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,515
And then our x is going to be
equal to a t, that's part

160
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:40,460
of our definition of our
parameterization, and y is

161
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,090
zero, so we can ignore it.

162
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,710
So this was a
super-simple integral.

163
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,580
So this simplified down to,
we're going to go from 0 to 2

164
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:54,540
of t dt, which is equal to the
antiderivative of t is just 1/2

165
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,240
t squared, and we're going to
go 0 to 2, which is equal

166
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,160
to 1/2 times 2 squared.

167
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,780
2 squared is 4, times 1/2
is 2, and then minus 1/2

168
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,410
times 0 squared, minus 0.

169
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,860
So this third wall's area
right there is just 2.

170
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,390
Pretty straightforward.

171
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,580
So that right there, the
area there, is just 2.

172
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,270
And so to answer our question,
what was this line integral

173
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,420
evaluated over this
closed path of f of xy?

174
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,870
Well, we just add
up these numbers.

175
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,980
We have 4 plus 2 pi plus 8/3
plus 2, well, what is this.

176
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,530
8/3 is same thing as 2 and 2/3,
so we have 4 plus 2 and 2/3 is

177
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:44,290
6 and 2/3, plus another 2 is 8
and 2/3, so this whole thing

178
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,880
becomes 8 and 2/3, if we
write it as a mixed

179
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,470
number, plus 2 pi.

180
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,550
And we're done!

181
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,190
And we're done.

182
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,210
Now we can start trying to
do line integrals with

183
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,460
vector-valued functions.

184
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,600
