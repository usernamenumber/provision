1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,480
Let's say I have some subspace
of rn called v.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,840
Let me draw it like this.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,550
So that it is r n.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,770
And I have some subspace of it
we'll call v right here.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,790
So that is my subspace v.

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:25,170
We know that the orthogonal
complement v is equal to the

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,840
set of all of the
members of rn.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,590
   

10
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,460
So x is a member of rn.

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:45,510
Such that x dot v is equal to 0
for every v that is a member

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,280
of r subspace.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,220
So our orthogonal complement of
our subspace is going to be

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,090
all of the vectors that
are orthogonal to

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,830
all of these vectors.

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,120
And we've seen before that they
only overlap-- there's

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,890
only one vector that's
a member of both.

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,220
That's the zero vector.

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,300
It's right there.

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,530
Let's take the orthogonal
complement.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,190
Let's say it's this set right
here in pink, so that's the

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,650
orthogonal complement.

23
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,710
Fair enough.

24
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,910
Now, what if we were to think
about the orthogonal

25
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,590
complement of the orthogonal
complement?

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,560
So, that's the orthogonal
complement in pink.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,720
We want the orthogonal
complement of that.

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,050
So this is going to be all
of the x's-- let's just

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,830
write it like this.

30
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:37,350
All of the x's that are members
of rn such that x dot

31
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,210
w is equal to 0.

32
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,620
For every w that is a member
of the orthogonal

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,660
complement of v.

34
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,600
That's what that thing
is saying.

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,080
So it's all of the vectors in
rn that are orthogonal to

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,690
everything here.

37
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,670
Obviously, all of the things in
v are going to be a member

38
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,120
of that because these guys are
orthogonal to everything in

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,970
these guys.

40
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,470
But maybe this is just a subset
of the orthogonal

41
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,360
complement of the orthogonal
complement.

42
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,440
So maybe this thing in blue
right here looks like this.

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
Maybe it's a slightly
larger set than v.

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,450
Maybe there are some things,
these things that I'm shading

45
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,350
in blue, maybe there are some
vectors that are orthogonal to

46
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,490
the orthogonal complement of v
but that are outside of v.

47
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,490
We don't know that yet.

48
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,070
We don't know whether this
area right here exists.

49
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,570
Or maybe the orthogonal
complement of the orthogonal

50
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,020
complement.

51
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,540
Maybe that takes us back to v.

52
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,285
Maybe it's like the transpose
or an inverse function where

53
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:39,990
it just goes back to our
original subspace.

54
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,880
Let's see if we can
think about that

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,550
a little bit better.

56
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,780
Let's say that I have some
member of the orthogonal

57
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,050
complement of the orthogonal
complement.

58
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:56,880
So let's say I have some vector
x that is a member of

59
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,790
the orthogonal complement of
the orthogonal complement.

60
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,140
Now, we saw on the last video
that any vector in rn can be

61
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,460
represented by a sum of some
vector in a subspace and the

62
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,380
subspace's complement.

63
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,930
So we know that x can be
represented-- we can say that

64
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,000
x can be represented as the
sum of two vectors.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,980
One that's in v and one that's
in the orthogonal

66
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,500
complement of v.

67
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,130
So one, let's call that the
vector that's in v and let's

68
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,400
call w the vector that's
in the orthogonal

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,380
complement of V.

70
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,400
Let me write it like this.

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,700
Where v is a member of the
subspace v and the vector w is

72
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,140
a member of the orthogonal
complement of v.

73
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,790
Right?

74
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,380
So this is some member.

75
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,860
It could be some guy out here.

76
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,080
It could be some
guy over here.

77
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,370
He's a member of the orthogonal
complement of the

78
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,120
orthogonal complement.

79
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,930
Which is this whole area here.

80
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,860
Which v is a subset of, but
we're not sure whether v

81
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,360
equals that thing.

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,170
But we say, look, anything
that's in the orthogonal

83
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,730
complement of your orthogonal
complement, is going to be a

84
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,645
member of rn.

85
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:10,770
And anything in rn can be
represented as a sum of a

86
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,120
vector in v and a vector
in the orthogonal

87
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,890
complement of v.

88
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,839
So that's all I wrote
right there.

89
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:25,620
Now, what happens if I take the
dot product of x with w?

90
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,460
What is this going
to be equal to?

91
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,650
This is the orthogonal
complement of the orthogonal

92
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,160
complement.

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,300
Would you take the dot product
of any vector in this with any

94
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,750
vector in the orthogonal
complement,

95
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,030
which this vector is.

96
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,280
Right?

97
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,690
It's a member of the orthogonal
complement.

98
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,660
You're going to get
0 by definition.

99
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,490
These are all of the vectors.

100
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,210
This factor is definitely
orthogonal to anything in just

101
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,590
v perp right?

102
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,780
Anything in v perp perp
is orthogonal to

103
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,030
anything in v perp.

104
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,420
So, this thing is going
to be equal to 0.

105
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,560
But what's another way
of writing x dot w?

106
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,950
We could write it like this.

107
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:07,050
This is the same thing
as v plus w dot w.

108
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:14,940
Which is the same thing as
v dot w plus w dot w.

109
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,700
Now, what is v dot w?

110
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,300
v is a member of our
original subspace.

111
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,690
And if you take the dot product
of anything in our

112
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,290
original subspace anything in
its orthogonal complement,

113
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,740
you're going to get 0.

114
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,970
So this term right here is going
to be 0, and you're just

115
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,450
going to get this term which
is the same thing as the

116
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,770
length of our vector
w squared.

117
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,520
Now, that has to equal 0.

118
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,330
Remember we just
wrote x dot w.

119
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,080
x is a member of the orthogonal
complement of your

120
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,250
orthogonal complement.

121
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,600
So, you dot that with anything
in the orthogonal complement,

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,020
that's got to be equal 0.

123
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,710
But, if we write it the other
way, if we write it as the sum

124
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,910
of v plus w and distribute this
w, we say that's the same

125
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,570
thing as the magnitude
of w squared.

126
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,810
So the magnitude of w squared
has got to be equal to 0.

127
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,360
The magnitude of w squared, or
the length of w squared, has

128
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,950
got to be equal to 0.

129
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,810
Which tells us that w
is the zero vector.

130
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,800
That's the only factor in rn
when you take its length and,

131
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,030
especially when you square
it, you get 0.

132
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,670
But you could just
take its length.

133
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,080
So what does that mean?

134
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,460
That means that our original
vector x is equal to v plus w.

135
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,460
But w is just equal to 0.

136
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,990
So that implies that
our original vector

137
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:44,050
x is equal to v.

138
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,180
And v is a member of
our subspace v.

139
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,000
Right?

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,460
So that tells us that x is a
member of our subspace v.

141
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,550
So we just showed that if
something is a member of the

142
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,870
orthogonal complement of the
orthogonal complement then

143
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,830
that same vector has
to be a member of

144
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,640
the original subspace.

145
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,400
So there is no such thing as
something being in the

146
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,070
orthogonal complement of the
orthogonal complement and not

147
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,120
being a member of our
original subspace.

148
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,220
All of this has to be inside
of this right there.

149
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,430
So there is no outside
blue space like that.

150
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,370
All of that is our original
subspace if you want to view

151
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,250
it that way.

152
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,770
Now I just at the beginning of
the video, anything in our

153
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,770
subspace is going to be a
member of our orthogonal

154
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,080
complement.

155
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,130
And then you can kind of reason
that in your head.

156
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,680
Let's use the same argument to
just be a little bit more

157
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,930
rigorous about it.

158
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,880
   

159
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,760
Right now we say if anything
is in the orthogonal

160
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,970
complement of the orthogonal
complement, then it's going to

161
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,460
be the original subspace.

162
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,130
Let's go the other way.

163
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,320
Let's say that something
is in the original

164
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,990
subspace just like that.

165
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,550
Let me draw another graph
right here because

166
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,390
this might be useful.

167
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,780
Let me draw rn again.

168
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,310
Let me draw all of
rn like that.

169
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,480
Now, we have the orthogonal
complement.

170
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:23,600
Let me just draw that first.
So v perp And then you have

171
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,650
the orthogonal complement of
the orthogonal complement

172
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,200
which could be this
set right here.

173
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,500
Right?

174
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,100
This is v perp.

175
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,350
I haven't even drawn
the subspace v.

176
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,690
All I've shown is, I have some
subspace here, which I happen

177
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,950
to call v perp.

178
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,140
And then I have the orthogonal
complement of that subspace.

179
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,200
So this means that anything in
rn can be represented as the

180
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,400
sum of a vector that's here
and a vector that's here.

181
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,300
So, if I say that w-- let
me do it in purple.

182
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,400
If I say the vector w-- let
me write it this way.

183
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,110
The vector v can be represented
as the sum of the

184
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:20,620
vector w and the vector x where
w is a member of the

185
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,580
orthogonal complement of v or
v perp And x is a member of

186
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,560
its orthogonal complement.

187
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,540
Notice, all I'm saying, I could
have called this set s.

188
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,530
And then this would have been
s and its orthogonal

189
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,410
complement.

190
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,230
And we learned that anything in
rn could be represented as

191
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,900
the sum of something in a
subspace and the subspace's

192
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,350
orthogonal complement.

193
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,220
So it doesn't matter that v is
somehow related to this.

194
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,720
It can be represented as
a sum of a vector here

195
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,270
plus a vector there.

196
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,480
Fair enough.

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,950
Now, what happens if
I dot v with w?

198
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,340
I'm doing the exact same
argument that I did before.

199
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,200
Well, if you take anything
that's a member of our

200
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,560
original subspace, and you dot
it with anything in its

201
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,120
orthogonal complement, that's
going to give us 0.

202
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,900
What else is that going
to be equal to?

203
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,680
If we write v in this way, v
dot w is the same thing as

204
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,650
this thing dot w.

205
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:29,600
So w plus x dot-- and this is
going to be equal to w dot w

206
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,020
plus x dot w.

207
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,340
And what's x dot w? x is in the
orthogonal complement of

208
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,980
your orthogonal complement.

209
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,710
And w is in the orthogonal
complement.

210
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,950
So if you take the dot
product, you're

211
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,600
going to get 0.

212
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,210
They're orthogonal
to each other.

213
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:49,020
So this is just equal to w dot
w or the length of w squared.

214
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,340
And since since has to equal
0, we just have a bunch of

215
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,060
equals here, that tells us that
once again the vector w

216
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,570
has to be equal to 0.

217
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,840
So that tells us v is
equal to w plus x.

218
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,400
But if w is equal to 0, then v
is going to be equal to x.

219
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:15,940
So we've just shown that if v is
a member of the subspace v,

220
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,650
then v is a member of the
orthogonal complement of the

221
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,590
orthogonal complement.

222
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,900
Right? v is equal to x, which is
a member of the orthogonal

223
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,170
complement or the orthogonal
complement.

224
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,020
So we've proven it both ways.

225
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,580
If you look at the original
statement, we wrote here that

226
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,290
if you're a member of the
orthogonal complement of the

227
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,840
orthogonal complement,
you're a member of

228
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,730
the original subspace.

229
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,190
So, we've proven this and,
earlier in the video, we

230
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,160
proved that if x is a member of
the orthogonal complement

231
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,870
of the orthogonal complement,
then x is a

232
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,840
member of our subspace.

233
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,300
So these two things
are equivalent.

234
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,460
Anything that's in
the subspace is a

235
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,150
member of v perp perp.

236
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,150
Anything in v perp perp is
a member of our subspace.

237
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,520
So, our subspace in v perp
perp are the same set.

238
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,400
And of course it overlaps.

239
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,670
This equals this.

240
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,100
And of course it overlaps with
V perp and its orthogonal

241
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,200
complement only at the zero
vector right there.

242
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,400
