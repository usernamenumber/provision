1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
We're on problem 36.

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,450
They've drawn a little
graph here.

4
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,170
So let's draw it up
for ourselves.

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,560
So that's the y-axis.

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,720
That is the x-axis.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,070
And then they have this point.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,090
Let's see, minus 1.

9
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:23,160
They say, 1, 2, 3.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,910
Let's see.

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,000
1, 2.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,360
And then they have this line
segment PQ that goes

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,330
from 0, minus 1.

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,290
Let me draw that in
a different color.

15
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,270
It goes from 0, minus
1 to 3 comma 2.

16
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:43,380
So it goes from there, so
3, so roughly there.

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,030
I think that's about as
good as I can do.

18
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,530
   

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,780
And the way they drew it,
it intersects 1 here.

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,530
And so this would be 3.

21
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,890
This is the point 3 comma 2.

22
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,410
And they say in the figure
above, the point on segment

23
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,290
PQ, so they say this is point
P, this is point Q.

24
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,390
The point on PQ that is twice
as far from P as from Q.

25
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,500
So the point is on this segment,
so this point is

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,420
someplace around here.

27
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,550
We could find points that are
away from the segment that are

28
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,160
twice as far from P as
from Q, but they say

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,170
it's on this segment.

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,190
So let's think about
it a little bit.

31
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,380
If we just look at how do we
get from P to Q, we go 3 to

32
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,280
the right, right? x increases
by 3 and y

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,210
increases by 3, right?

34
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,240
So if we wanted to go 2/3 along
the way, what if we just

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:44,520
increased x by 2 to get to x is
equal to 2 and increased y

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,310
by 2, right?

37
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,650
So the x's and y's only
increase by 2/3

38
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,240
of the way to Q.

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,490
So then that would
be the point.

40
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,240
   

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,230
x is 2 and then y is 1.

42
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:04,000
That would be the point
2 comma 1, which is B.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,590
Next question.

44
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,200
37.

45
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,560
If a positive integer n is
divisible by both 5 and 7,

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,050
than n must be divisible by
which of the following?

47
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,270
Let's see, they give
us a couple of

48
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,595
choices: I, II and III.

49
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:27,140
   

50
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,800
So they say it has to
be divisible by 12.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,370
No, that's not the case.

52
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,350
35 is divisible by 5 and 7.

53
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,960
It's not divisible by 12.

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,290
35.

55
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,090
Well, sure.

56
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,460
If you're divisible by 5 and
7, that means it's equal to

57
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,290
some constant times
5 times 7, right?

58
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,110
And this could be a bunch of
numbers multiplied together.

59
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,780
But that means it's equal to 35
times some other integer,

60
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,010
and that integer could have
a bunch of other factors.

61
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,510
So, right.

62
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,700
It has to be divisible by 35.

63
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,110
And statement III is 70.

64
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,220
Well, no, 35 is divisible
by 5 and 7, but it's not

65
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,680
divisible by 70.

66
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,920
So statement III is not right.

67
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,360
So it's II only.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,430
So that's C.

69
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,780
Question 38.

70
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:28,340
If 4 is one solution to the
equation x squared plus 3x

71
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,575
plus k is equal to 10,
so 4 is one solution.

72
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:38,980
So that means if I were to
factor this, it'll be x minus

73
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,530
4 times x plus or minus
something else, because we

74
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,060
know that x minus 4 equals 0,
which tells us that x is equal

75
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,080
to 4 is one of the solutions.

76
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,800
So what are they going
to ask us?

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,830
They're going to say, where k
is a constant, what is the

78
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,080
other solution?

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,830
   

80
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,070
So let's think about
it a little bit.

81
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,650
Well, actually, let me rewrite
it a little different.

82
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,840
I didn't realize that they
said this is equal to 10.

83
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,740
So let's subtract 10
from both sides.

84
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,600
We get x squared plus 3x-- you
essentially want to find the

85
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:21,829
roots of this quadratic-- plus
k minus 10 is equal to 0.

86
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,280
And you want to factor
it, right?

87
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,450
You could factor
any quadratic.

88
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:30,180
It's going to be x plus
a times x plus b.

89
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,760
And they're telling us
that 4 is one of

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,170
the solutions, right?

91
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,210
4 is one of the solutions,
so minus 4 could be a.

92
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,620
So this would be x minus 4 times
some other number, x

93
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,200
plus b, is equal to 0.

94
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,590
And I said positive
4 in the solution.

95
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,360
Why did I put a minus 4 here?

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,740
Because think about it.

97
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,270
If we factor this quadratic and
we get this, that's tells

98
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,540
us either x minus 4 is
0 or x plus b is 0.

99
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:03,390
If x minus 4 is 0, then the
solution is x is equal to 4,

100
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,770
so that's why I wrote
x minus 4 there.

101
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,440
But anyway, let's figure
out what b could be.

102
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,780
So if we multiply this out to
try to pattern match it with

103
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:22,540
this, we get x times x is x
squared minus 4x plus b times

104
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:29,310
x, and then you have minus
4 times b, so minus 4b.

105
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,840
So then this is equal to x
squared, and then we could

106
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,620
write it plus b minus
4 times x.

107
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,760
I just factored an x out of
these two terms, right?

108
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,500
And so you get b minus 4
minus 4b is equal to 0.

109
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,730
So now you just pattern
match it.

110
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:55,190
You say b minus 4-- x squared
equals x squared.

111
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,890
b minus 4x has to be
equal to 3x, right?

112
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,830
We're just pattern matching.

113
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,200
That's the only first-degree
x term there.

114
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,750
So b minus 4 has to be equal--
x has to be equal to 3x.

115
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,700
We don't even care about k.

116
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:13,490
So b minus 4 has to be equal
to 3, or b is equal to 7.

117
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,590
   

118
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,560
Oh, right, right.

119
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,870
So they want to know what
the other solution is.

120
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,770
They don't want to
know what b is.

121
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,650
And I was looking and
was like, oh, wow,

122
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,810
there isn't a 7 there.

123
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,960
There's a negative 7.

124
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,130
So that tells us that the
factorization of this

125
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,490
problem-- I would have gotten
that wrong if they put a 7

126
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,240
there, because I wasn't
careful-- is x minus 4 times x

127
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,800
plus 7 is equal to 0, right?

128
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,770
So we already said we could say
x minus 4 is equal to 0.

129
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,150
And that's where we get
the 4 solution.

130
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,180
Or we could say x plus
7 is equal to 0.

131
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,590
Subtract 7 from both sides.

132
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,280
The other solution is x
is equal to minus 7.

133
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,920
That was a careless mistake I
almost made, but I got saved

134
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,942
by the choices.

135
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:53,950
So that's choice A.

136
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,890
Next problem.

137
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,370
39.

138
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,720
If x is equal to negative
3, what is the

139
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,020
value of minus 3x squared?

140
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,120
So I don't know, maybe they're
trying to test your ability to

141
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,280
do order of operations
or something.

142
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,920
So this is equal to minus 3
times minus three squared,

143
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,810
right? x squared.

144
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,260
So this is equal to minus
3 times positive 9.

145
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,240
Minus 3 squared is positive 9,
which equals minus 27, which

146
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,490
is choice A.

147
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,790
   

148
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,040
Next question.

149
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,260
   

150
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,920
40.

151
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:51,560
29 squared plus 29, over
29 is equal to?

152
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,180
Well, let's just divide
the numerator and the

153
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,160
denominator by 29.

154
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,160
What's 29 squared?

155
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,790
This is the same thing as 29
squared over 29 plus-- I'm

156
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,130
just going to separate these
two terms out-- plus 29/29.

157
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,530
29 squared divided by 29.

158
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,360
x squared divided by x is x.

159
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,490
29 squared divided
by 29 is 29.

160
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,640
29 divided by 29 is 1,
so it equals 30.

161
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,300
So that is choice E.

162
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,210
Problem 41.

163
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:36,030
If x is equal to 1 minus 3t and
y is equal to 2t minus 1.

164
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,980
So I'm going to write
it like this.

165
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,490
minus 1 plus 2t.

166
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,610
I just want to put the t's
under each other, right?

167
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,860
2t minus 1.

168
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,840
   

169
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,940
For what value of t
does x equal y?

170
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,340
OK, so let's just set x equal
y and solve for t.

171
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,950
So we could just say if x is
equal to y, we get 1 minus 3t

172
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,250
has to equal this, which
is 2t minus 1.

173
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,770
   

174
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,790
Let's add 3t to both sides.

175
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,110
So you get 1-- 3t goes
away from there--

176
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,550
equals 5t, minus 1.

177
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,680
Add 1 to both sides.

178
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,130
You get 2 is equal to 5t.

179
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,220
Divide both sides by 5.

180
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,570
You get t is equal to 5/2,
which is choice A.

181
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,550
   

182
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,100
And I'm almost out of time.

183
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,900
The next one has a diagram,
which always takes me some

184
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,850
time to draw, so I'll see
you in the next video.

185
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:33,900
