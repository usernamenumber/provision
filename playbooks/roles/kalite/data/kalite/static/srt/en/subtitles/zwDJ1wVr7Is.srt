1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,450
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,520
We'll now do another tension
problem and this one is just a

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,340
slight increment harder than the
previous one just because

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,390
we have to take out slightly
more sophisticated algebra

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,490
tools than we did
in the last one.

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,000
But it's not really
any harder.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,990
But you should actually see this
type of problem because

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,810
you'll probably see
it on an exam.

10
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,440
So let's figure out the
tension in the wire.

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,950
So first of all, we know
that this point

12
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,380
right here isn't moving.

13
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,700
So the tension in this little
small wire right here is easy.

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,170
It's trivial.

15
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,850
The force of gravity is pulling
down at this point

16
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,170
with 10 Newtons because you
have this weight here.

17
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,200
And of course, since this
point is stationary, the

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,750
tension in this wire has to
be 10 Newtons upward.

19
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,300
That's an easy one.

20
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,600
So let's just figure out the
tension in these two slightly

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,550
more difficult wires to figure
out the tensions of.

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,500
So once again, we know that this
point right here, this

23
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,760
point is not accelerating
in any direction.

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,900
It's not accelerating in the
x direction, nor is it

25
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,340
accelerating in the vertical
direction or the y direction.

26
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,970
So we know that the net forces
in the x direction need to be

27
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,800
0 on it and we know the
net forces in the y

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,970
direction need to be 0.

29
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,410
So what are the net forces
in the x direction?

30
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,120
Well they're going to be the x
components of these two-- of

31
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,750
the tension vectors of
both of these wires.

32
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,820
I guess let's draw the tension
vectors of the two wires.

33
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,065
So this T1, it's pulling.

34
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:21,870
The tension vector pulls in
the direction of the wire

35
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,240
along the same line.

36
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,740
So let's say that this is the
tension vector of T1.

37
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,620
If that's the tension vector,
its x component will be this.

38
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,690
Let me see how good
I can draw this.

39
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,440
It's intended to be a straight
line, but that

40
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,920
would be its x component.

41
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,570
And its x component, let's
see, this is 30 degrees.

42
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,440
This is 30 degrees right here.

43
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,070
And hopefully this is a bit
second nature to you.

44
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,320
If this value up here
is T1, what is the

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,590
value of the x component?

46
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:59,860
It's T1 cosine of 30 degrees.

47
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,200
And you could do your
SOH-CAH-TOA.

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,810
You know, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

49
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,430
So the cosine of 30 degrees is
equal to-- This over T1 one is

50
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,800
equal to the x component
over T1.

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,010
And if you multiply both sides
by T1, you get this.

52
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,690
This should be a little bit of
second nature right now.

53
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,050
That the x component is going to
be the cosine of the angle

54
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,350
between the hypotenuse and
the x component times the

55
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,440
hypotenuse.

56
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,485
And similarly, the x component
here-- Let me

57
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:28,860
draw this force vector.

58
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,675
So if this is T2, this would
be its x component.

59
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:38,260
   

60
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,320
And very similarly, this is 60
degrees, so this would be T2

61
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,130
cosine of 60.

62
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,920
Now what do we know about
these two vectors?

63
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,150
We know that their
net force is 0.

64
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,500
Or that you also know that the
magnitude of these two vectors

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,340
should cancel each other out
or that they're equal.

66
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,570
I mean, they're pulling in
opposite directions.

67
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,030
That's pretty obvious.

68
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,900
And so you know that their
magnitudes need to be equal.

69
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,950
So we know that T1 cosine
of 30 is going to equal

70
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,810
T2 cosine of 60.

71
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,990
So let's write that down.

72
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:27,070
T1 cosine of 30 degrees is
equal to T2 cosine of 60.

73
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,890
And then we could bring the
T2 on to this side.

74
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,900
And actually, let's also-- I'm
trying to save as much space

75
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,950
as possible because I'm guessing
this is going to take

76
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,550
up a lot of room,
this problem.

77
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,070
What's the cosine
of 30 degrees?

78
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,410
If you haven't memorized
it already, it's square

79
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,040
root of 3 over 2.

80
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,640
So this becomes square root
of 3 over 2 times T1.

81
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,510
That's the cosine
of 30 degrees.

82
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,290
And then I'm going to bring
this on to this side.

83
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,590
So the cosine of 60
is actually 1/2.

84
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,520
You could use your calculator
if you forgot that.

85
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,320
So this is 1/2 T2.

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,590
Bring it on this side so
it becomes minus 1/2.

87
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,940
I'm skipping more steps than
normal just because I don't

88
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,020
want to waste too much space.

89
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,160
And this equals 0.

90
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,370
But if you seen the other
videos, hopefully I'm not

91
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,410
creating too many gaps.

92
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,960
And this is relatively
easy to follow.

93
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,269
So we have the square root of
3 times T1 minus 1/2 T2 is

94
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:19,800
equal to 0.

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,700
So that gives us an equation.

96
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,320
One equation with two unknowns,
so it doesn't help

97
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,050
us much so far.

98
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,250
But let's square that away
because I have a feeling this

99
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,330
will be useful.

100
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,330
Now what's going to be happening
on the y components?

101
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,580
So let's say that this is the y
component of T1 and this is

102
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,230
the y component of T2.

103
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,860
What do we know?

104
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,450
What what do we know about
the two y components?

105
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,890
I could've drawn them here too
and then just shift them over

106
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,240
to the left and the right.

107
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,210
We know that their combined
pull upwards, the combined

108
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,500
pull of the two vertical tension
components has to

109
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,770
offset the force of gravity
pulling down because this

110
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,130
point is stationary.

111
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,310
So we know these two y
components, when you add them

112
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,210
together, the combined tension
in the vertical direction has

113
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,680
to be 10 Newtons.

114
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,240
Because it's offsetting
this force of gravity.

115
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,990
So what's this y component?

116
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,970
Well, this was T1
of cosine of 30.

117
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,140
This should start to become a
little second nature to you

118
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,180
that this is T1 sine of 30, this
y component right here.

119
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,570
So T1-- Let me write it here.

120
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:34,875
T1 sine of 30 degrees plus this
vector, which is T2 sine

121
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,820
of 60 degrees.

122
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,910
You could review your
trigonometry and your

123
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,650
SOH-CAH-TOA.

124
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,830
Frankly, I think, just seeing
what people get confused on is

125
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,680
the trigonometry.

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,340
But you can review the trig
modules and maybe some of the

127
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,370
earlier force vector modules
that we did.

128
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,100
And hopefully, these
will make sense.

129
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,460
I'm skipping a few steps.

130
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,870
And these will equal
10 Newtons.

131
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,370
And let's rewrite this up here
where I substitute the values.

132
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,650
So what's the sine of 30?

133
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,180
Actually, let me do
it right here.

134
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,400
What's the sine of 30 degrees?

135
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:15,000
The sine of 30 degrees is 1/2 so
we get 1/2 T1 plus the sine

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,420
of 60 degrees, which is square
root of 3 over 2.

137
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,150
Square root of 3 over
2 T2 is equal to 10.

138
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,850
And then I don't like
this, all these 2's

139
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,780
and this 1/2 here.

140
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,850
So let's multiply this
whole equation by 2.

141
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,170
So 2 times 1/2, that's 1.

142
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:37,940
So you get T1 plus the square
root of 3 T2 is equal to, 2

143
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,400
times 10 , is 20.

144
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,330
Similarly, let's take this
equation up here and let's

145
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,520
multiply this equation by 2
and bring it down here.

146
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,980
So this is the original
one that we got.

147
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,630
So if we multiply this whole
thing by 2-- I'll do it in

148
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,130
this color so that
you know that

149
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,230
it's a different equation.

150
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,410
So if you multiply square root
of 3 over 2 times 2-- I'm just

151
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,350
doing this to get rid of the
2's in the denominator.

152
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:10,360
So you get square root of 3 T1
minus T2 is equal to 0 because

153
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,080
0 times 2 is 0.

154
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,410
And let's see what
we could do.

155
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,960
What if we take this top
equation because we want to

156
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,790
start canceling out some terms.
Let's take this top

157
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:24,880
equation and let's multiply
it by-- oh, I don't know.

158
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,620
Let's multiply it by the
square root of 3.

159
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:36,740
So you get the square
root of 3 T1.

160
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,950
I'm taking this top equation
multiplied by the

161
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,320
square root of 3.

162
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,680
This is just a system
of equations

163
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,100
that I'm solving for.

164
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,990
And the square root of 3
times this right here.

165
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,030
Square root of 3 times square
root of 3 is 3.

166
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:54,200
So plus 3 T2 is equal to
20 square root of 3.

167
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,600
And now what I want to do is
let's-- I know I'm doing a lot

168
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,160
of equation manipulation here.

169
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,380
But this is just hopefully, a
review of algebra for you.

170
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,590
Let's subtract this equation
from this equation.

171
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,960
So you can also view it as
multiplying it by negative 1

172
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,300
and then adding the 2.

173
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,930
So when you subtract this from
this, these two terms cancel

174
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,620
out because they're the same.

175
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,010
And so then you're left with
minus T2 from here.

176
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:31,170
Minus this, minus 3 T2 is equal
to 0 minus 20 square

177
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,490
roots of 3.

178
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:40,460
And so this becomes minus 4 T2
is equal to minus 20 square

179
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,480
roots of 3.

180
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,930
And then, divide both sides by
minus 4 and you get T2 is

181
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,320
equal to 5 square roots
of 3 Newtons.

182
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,150
So that's the tension
in this wire.

183
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,090
And now we can substitute
and figure out T1.

184
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,460
Let's use this formula
right here because it

185
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,120
looks suitably simple.

186
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,160
So we have the square root
of 3 times T1 minus T2.

187
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,960
Well T2 is 5 square
roots of 3.

188
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,950
5 square roots of
3 is equal to 0.

189
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,860
So we have the square root of
3 T1 is equal to five square

190
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,060
roots of 3.

191
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,370
Divide both sides by square
root of 3 and you get the

192
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,010
tension in the first wire
is equal to 5 Newtons.

193
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,880
So this is pulling with a force
or tension of 5 Newtons.

194
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,150
Or a force.

195
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,460
And this is pulling-- the second
wire --with a tension

196
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,990
of 5 square roots
of 3 Newtons.

197
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,430
So this wire right
here is actually

198
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,410
doing more of the pulling.

199
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,670
It's actually more of the force
of gravity is ending up

200
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,650
on this wire.

201
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,820
That makes sense because
it's steeper.

202
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,800
So since it's steeper,
it's contributing

203
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,970
more to the y component.

204
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,600
It's good whenever you do these
problems to kind of do a

205
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,520
reality check just to make sure
your numbers make sense.

206
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,800
And if you think about it,
their combined tension is

207
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,490
something more than
10 Newtons.

208
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,750
And that makes sense because
some of the force that they're

209
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,940
pulling with is wasted against
pulling each other in the

210
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,520
horizontal direction.

211
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,150
Anyway, I'll see you all
in the next video.

212
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,500
