1
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:08,800
Lets say we have one ray over here that starts at point A and then goes through point B, and so we could

2
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,933
call this ray (we could call, let me draw that a little bit straighter) we could call this ray AB. Ray AB

3
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,867
starts at A or has a vertex at A and lets say that there is also a ray AC. So lets say that C is sitting

4
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,600
right over there and then i can draw another ray that goes through C, so this is ray AC. and what's interesting

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,733
about these two rays is that they have the exact same vertex. (they have the exact same vertex at A)

6
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:43,600
and in general what we have when we have two rays with the exact same vertex, you have an angle. and

7
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:50,600
you've probably, you're probably already reasonably familiar with the concept of an angle which i believe

8
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,800
comes from the latin for corner, which makes sense this looks a little bit like a corner right over

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
here that we see at point A and, but the geometric definition, or the one you are more likely to see

10
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:07,667
is when two rays share a common vertex. and that common vertex is actually called the vertex of the angle.

11
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:16,533
so A is vertex. Not only is it the vertex of each of these rays, ray AB and ray AC, it is also the vertex

12
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:24,667
of, of the angle. so the next thing i want to think about is how do we label, how do we label an angle

13
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:31,333
you might be tempted to just label it angle A, but i'll show you in a second why that's not going to

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,800
be so clear to someone based on where, where our angle is actually sitting. so the way that you specify

15
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:46,600
an angle, and hopefully this will make sense in a second, is that you say ANGLE, (this is the symbol

16
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:58,200
for angle) and it actually looks strangely similar to this angle right over here, but this little pointy

17
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:05,333
thing almost looks like a less than sign, but it's not quite. its flat on the bottom right over here.

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
this is the symbol for angle, you would say angle BAC, BAC, or you could say angle CAB, or angle CAB.

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,133
and either case there kind of specifying this corner, or sometimes you could view it as this opening

20
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:16,933
right over here. and the important thing to realize is that you have the vertex in the middle of the

21
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,467
letters. and you might be saying why go through the trouble of listing all three of these letters, why

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,133
can't i just call this angle A. and to see that, let me show you another diagram. and although the geometric

23
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:36,600
definition involves, two rays that have the same vertex

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,667
in practice, you are going to see many angles

25
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:50,467
made of line and line segments

26
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:54,267
Lets say I have one line segment like that, let me

27
00:02:54,267 --> 00:03:07,800
label it DE, and lets also have line segment, FG

28
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,000
and lets say the point where the two line segments interact

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,533
is H, how could we specify this angle right over here

30
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:27,800
can we call it as angle H, if we say it as angle H,

31
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:45,000
it could be this angle, that angle or this angle over here

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,467
it could be this angle over here. The only way to specify

33
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:54,867
which can we are talking about is to give 3 letters

34
00:03:54,867 --> 00:04:01,467
if you want to talk about this angle, you will call it

35
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:12,400
angle EHG, or could call it angle GHE,

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,933
if you wanted this angle over here, you could call it

37
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:40,867
angle DHG, or angle GHD. i think you get the point.

38
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:45,600
this angle is angle FHE or EHF and this is angle FHD or

39
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:54,533
DHF. now are are clear which angle you are referring to.

40
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:58,467
So now we have a general idea what an angle is and how

41
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:02,933
we denote it with symbols, it does not look like

42
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:13,267
all angles look the same. Some are more open than others

43
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:19,133
So for example, let us take two angles here,

44
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:58,933
angle BAC, and let's say over here, I have angle XYZ

45
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:06,333
when you look at these angle XYZ is more open

46
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:15,800
while this angle is more closed, compared to the other angle

47
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,267
when we measure angles, we must measure it on how open

48
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:32,000
or closed they are. The measure of angle XYZ, is greater

49
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,133
than the measure of the angle ABC.

50
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:44,533
Any measure of angles, is based on how open, or closed

51
00:06:44,533 --> 99:59:59,999
they are which we will see in the next vidoes
