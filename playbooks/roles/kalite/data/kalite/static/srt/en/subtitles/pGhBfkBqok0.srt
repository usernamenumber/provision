1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,720
Let's say I've got some subspace
of Rn called V.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,370
So V is a subspace of Rn.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,920
And let's say that
I know its basis.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,732
Let's say the set.

6
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:17,410
So I have a bunch of-- let me
make that bracket a little

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,970
nicer-- so let's say the set of
the vectors v1, v2, all the

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:29,180
way to vk, let's say that this
is equal to-- this is the

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,630
basis for V.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,880
And just as a reminder, that
means that V's vectors both

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,360
span V and they're linearly
independent.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,080
You can kind of see there's a
minimum set of vectors in Rn

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,420
that span V.

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,660
So, if I were to ask you what
the dimension of V is, that's

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,490
just the number of vectors
you have in your

16
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,900
basis for the subspace.

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,180
So we have 1, 2 and we
count to k vectors.

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,290
So it is equal to k.

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,140
Now let's think about, if we
can somehow figure out what

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,000
the dimension of the orthogonal

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,070
complement of V can be.

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,330
And to do that, let's
construct a matrix.

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,980
Let's construct a matrix
whose column vectors

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,690
are these basis vectors.

25
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,115
So let's construct a matrix
A, and let's say

26
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:18,790
it looks like this.

27
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,090
First column is v1.

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,370
This first basis vector
right there.

29
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,390
v2 is the second one, and then
you go all the way to vk.

30
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,280
   

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,360
Just to make sure we remember
the dimensions, we have k of

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,790
these vectors, so we're going
to have k columns.

33
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,580
And then how many rows
are we going to have?

34
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,710
Well, as a member of Rn, so
these are all going to have n

35
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,560
entries in each of these
vectors, there's going to be

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,600
an n-- we're going to have
n rows and k columns.

37
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,740
It's an n by k matrix.

38
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,780
Now, what's another way of
expressing the subspace V?

39
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,570
Well, the basis for V is-- or
V is spanned by these basis

40
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,770
vectors, which is the
columns of these.

41
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,360
So if I talk about the span--
so let me write out this-- V

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,030
is equal to the span of
these guys, v1, v2,

43
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,970
all the way to vk.

44
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,380
And that's just the same thing
as the column space of A.

45
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,620
Right?

46
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,520
These are the column vectors,
and the span of them, that's

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,190
equal to the column
space of A.

48
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,030
Now, I said a little while ago,
we want to somehow relate

49
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,220
to the orthogonal
complement of V.

50
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,590
Well, what's the orthogonal
complement of the

51
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,690
column space of A?

52
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,230
The orthogonal complement of
the column space of A, I

53
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,130
showed you-- I think it was two
or three videos ago-- that

54
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,420
the column space of A's
orthogonal complement is equal

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,690
to-- you could either view
it as the null space of A

56
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,650
transpose, or another way
you call it is the left

57
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,070
null space of A.

58
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,870
This is equivalent to the
orthogonal complement of the

59
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,760
column space of A, which is
also going to be equal to,

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,700
which is also since this piece
right here is the same thing

61
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,560
as V, you take it's orthogonal
complement, that's the same

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,240
thing as V's orthogonal
complement.

63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,340
So if we want to figure out
there orthogonal complement

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,590
of-- if we want to figure out
the dimension-- if we want to

65
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,370
figure out the dimensional of
the orthogonal complement of

66
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,230
V, we just need to figure out
the dimension of the left null

67
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,210
space of A, or the null space
of A's transpose.

68
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,555
Let me write that down.

69
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:38,030
So the dimension-- get you
tongue-tied sometimes-- the

70
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,280
dimension of the orthogonal
complement of V is going to be

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,600
equal do the dimension
of A transpose.

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,160
Or another way to think of it
is-- sorry, not just the

73
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,350
dimension of A transpose, the
dimension of the null space of

74
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,600
A transpose.

75
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,120
   

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,620
And if you have a good memory,
I don't use the word a lot,

77
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,160
this thing is the nullity--
this is the

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,700
nullity of A transpose.

79
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,380
   

80
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,640
The dimension of your null
space is nullity, the

81
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,079
dimension of your column
space is your rank.

82
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,610
Now let's see what
we can do here.

83
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,079
So let's just take A transpose,
so you can just

84
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,230
imagine A transpose
for a second.

85
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,140
I can just even draw it out.

86
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:33,890
It's going to be a k by n matrix
that looks like this.

87
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,760
These columns are going
to turn into rows.

88
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,240
This is going to be v1
transpose, v2 transpose, all

89
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,270
the way down to vk transpose
vectors.

90
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,640
These are all now row vectors.

91
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,820
So we know one thing.

92
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,120
We know one relationship between
the rank and nullity

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,470
of any matrix.

94
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,720
We know that they're equal to
the number of columns we have.

95
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:10,910
We know that the rank of A
transpose plus the nullity of

96
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,520
A transpose is equal
to the number of

97
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,280
columns of A transpose.

98
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,460
We have n columns.

99
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,635
Each of these have n entries.

100
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,120
It is equal to n.

101
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,800
We saw this a while ago.

102
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,970
And if you want just a bit of a
reminder of where that comes

103
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,060
from, when you take a-- if I
wrote A transpose as a bunch

104
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,480
of column vectors, which I can,
or maybe let me take some

105
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,060
other vector B, because I want
to just remind you where this,

106
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,480
why this made sense.

107
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,290
If I take some vector B here,
and it has got a bunch of

108
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,840
column vectors, b1, b2, all the
way to bn, and I put it

109
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,090
into reduced row echelon form,
you're going to have some

110
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,730
pivot columns and some
non-pivot columns.

111
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,100
So let's say this is
a pivot column.

112
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,490
You know, I got a 1 and a bunch
of 0's, let's say that

113
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,510
this is one of them, and then
let's say I got one other one

114
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,400
that's out, and it would be a 0
there, it's a 1 down there,

115
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,610
and everything else is
a non-pivot column.

116
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,580
I showed you in the last video
that your basis for your

117
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,350
column space is the number of
pivot columns you have. So

118
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,300
these guys are pivot columns.

119
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,400
The corresponding column vectors
form a basis for your

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,310
column space.

121
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,290
I showed you that in
the last video.

122
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,550
And so, if you want to know the
dimension of your column

123
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,190
space, you just have to
count these things.

124
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,440
You just count these things.

125
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,490
This was equal to the number of,
well, for this B's case,

126
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,080
the rank of B is just equal to
the number of pivot columns I

127
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,230
have. Now the nullity is the
dimension of your null space.

128
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,830
We've done multiple problems
where we found the null space

129
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,850
of matrices.

130
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,840
And every time, the dimension,
it's a bit obvious, and I

131
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,760
actually showed you this proof,
it's related to the

132
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,990
number of free columns you have,
or non-pivot columns.

133
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,040
So, if you have no pivot
columns, then you are -- if

134
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,370
all of your columns are pivot
columns, and none of them have

135
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,170
free variables or are
associated with free

136
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,740
variables, then you're null
space is going to be trivial.

137
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,540
It's just going to have
the 0 vector.

138
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,240
But the more free variables
you have, the more

139
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,800
dimensionality your
null space has.

140
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,810
So the free columns correspond
to the null space, and they

141
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,100
form actually a basis
for your null space.

142
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,420
And because of that, the basis
for your null space vectors,

143
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,520
plus the basis for your column
space, is equal to the total

144
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,040
number of columns you have. I
showed that to you in the

145
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,410
past, but it's always good
to remind ourselves

146
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,760
where things come from.

147
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,100
But this was just
a bit of a side.

148
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,260
I did this with a separate
vector B.

149
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,220
Just to remind ourselves
where this thing

150
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,820
right here came from.

151
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,750
Now, in the last video, I showed
you that the rank of A

152
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,040
transpose is the same thing
is the rank of A.

153
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,540
This is equal to, this part
right here, is the same thing

154
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,790
as the rank of A.

155
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,990
I showed you that in
the last video.

156
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,510
When you transpose a matrix, it
doesn't change its rank, or

157
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,090
it doesn't change the dimension
of its column space.

158
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,350
So we can rewrite this
statement, right here, as the

159
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:07,130
rank of A plus the nullity of A
transpose is equal to n, and

160
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,840
the rank of A is the same thing
as the dimension of the

161
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,470
column space of A.

162
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,290
And then the nullity of A
transpose is the same thing as

163
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,580
the dimension of the null space
of A transpose-- that's

164
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,100
just the definition of nullity--
they're going to be

165
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,310
equal to n.

166
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,700
Now what's the dimension--
what's the column space of A?

167
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,620
The column space of A, that's
what's spanned by these

168
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,429
vectors right here, which
were the basis for V.

169
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,464
So this is the same thing
as the dimension of V.

170
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:40,179
The column space of A is the
same thing as the dimension of

171
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,270
my subspace V that I started
this video with.

172
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,460
And what is the null space
of A transpose?

173
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,880
The null space of A transpose,
we saw already, that's the

174
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,160
orthogonal complement of V.

175
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,670
So I could write this as plus
the dimension of the

176
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,050
orthogonal complement
of V is equal to n.

177
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,770
And that's the result
we wanted.

178
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:17,670
If V is a subspace of Rn, that n
is the same thing as that n,

179
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,890
then the dimension of V plus
the dimension of the

180
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,490
orthogonal complement of V is
going to be equal to n.

181
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:26,533
