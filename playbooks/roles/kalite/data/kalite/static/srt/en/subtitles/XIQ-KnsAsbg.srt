1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,930
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,460
I'm now going to do some more
examples of a bit of a review

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,300
of some of the derivatives
that we've been seeing.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,450
And then I'll introduce you to
something called the chain rule

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,080
which expands the universe of
the types of functions we can

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,290
take the derivatives of.

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,540
So in the last presentation, I
showed you how to function if I

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:30,270
had f of x is equal to 10x to
the seventh plus 6x to the

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:39,330
third plus 15x minus
x to the 16th.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,160
To take the derivative of this
entire function, we take just

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,840
the derivatives of each
of the pieces, right?

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,640
Because you can add them up.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,560
So f prime of x in this
example, is equal to-- and

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,755
I think you get the hang
of it at this point.

15
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:54,150
It's actually fairly
straightforward.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,480
We take the 7, multiply
it by the 10.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,620
So we get 70x, then
1 degree less.

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:10,940
So 70x to the sixth plus
18x squared plus 15.

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,010
We can kind of view this
as x to the 1, right?

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,920
So it's 1 times 15
times x to the 0.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,550
Which is 1.

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,840
So that's just 15 minus
16x to the 15th.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,330
And I don't want you to
lose sight of what we're

24
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,090
actually doing here.

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,870
What is f prime of x?

26
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,770
This is the function the tells
us the slope of any point

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,450
x, along the curve f of x.

28
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,860
It's a pretty
interesting thing.

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,795
Let me just draw to maybe give
you a little bit of intuition.

30
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:45,300
32
00:01:45,3 --> 00:01:47,49
I don't know what the slope
of f of x really looks like.

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,560
And actually, let's pretend
like this isn't f of x.

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,360
Let's pretend like this
is just some arbitrary

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,270
function I'm drawing.

34
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,210
If this is f of x, just some
curve that does all sorts of

35
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,430
crazy things, f prime of x
tells me the slope at any

36
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,810
point along that line.

37
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:09,950
So if I wanted to know the
slope at this point right here,

38
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,060
I could use the derivative
function to figure out the

39
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,120
slope of the tangent line.

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,740
The tangent line is something
like that right there.

41
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,930
Or if I wanted to figure out
the slope at this point,

42
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,890
once again I'd use the
derivative function.

43
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,340
And it would tell me the
slope of the tangent

44
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,100
line at that point.

45
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,150
Which would be
something like that.

46
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,960
So it's a pretty useful thing.

47
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,900
And once I give you all the
tools to analytically solve a

48
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,560
whole host of derivatives, then
we'll actually do a bunch

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,140
of word problems and
applications of derivatives.

50
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,270
And I think you'll see that
it's a really, really,

51
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,700
really useful concept.

52
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,600
So let's move on.

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,960
I think you get the idea of
how to do these derivatives

54
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,610
of polynomials.

55
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,760
Let me erase this.

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,650
I'm actually using a
different tool now.

57
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,110
So I think it might
be a bit easier.

58
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,630
Let's see, someone
was calling me.

59
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,520
But you're more important so
I will not answer the phone.

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:08,440
63
00:03:08,44 --> 00:03:11,64
I'm going to introduce you--
this tool doesn't have, I

61
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,330
don't think it has a
straight up eraser.

62
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,230
Actually, maybe let's see.

63
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,350
If I do it like this.

64
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:27,480
68
00:03:27,48 --> 00:03:28,4
Oh let me see.

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,900
70
00:03:30,9 --> 00:03:32,15
No that doesn't work.

66
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,080
Let me just erase like this,
the old-fashioned way.

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,530
73
00:03:39,53 --> 00:03:41
You just have to bear with me.

68
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,900
This is good.

69
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,410
It feels like I'm a real
teacher with a real chalkboard

70
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,490
and a real eraser now.

71
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,530
79
00:03:53,53 --> 00:03:56,75
This is a lot cleaner than a
normal chalkboard as well.

72
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,960
Bear with me, almost there.

73
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,630
I'll figure out a faster
way to do this over the

74
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,590
next couple of videos.

75
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,210
It's pretty sad.

76
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,670
I'm showing you how to do
derivatives in calculus, but

77
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,910
I don't know how to erase
a faster way than this.

78
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,270
87
00:04:14,27 --> 00:04:15,56
There, we're done.

79
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:15,900
OK.

80
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,290
So now I'm going show you how
to solve the derivatives of a

81
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,360
slightly more complicated
type of a function.

82
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,080
It's actually not
more complicated.

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,450
It's just different.

84
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:42,890
So let's say f of x is equal to
2x plus 3 to the fifth power.

85
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,220
And I want to figure out
the derivative of this.

86
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,320
We're going to use something
called the chain rule.

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,020
Because one thing we could do,
we could just multiply out 2x

88
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,600
plus 3 to the fifth power.

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,420
And if you've ever done
that, you know it's a pain.

90
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,540
So that's not something
we'd want to do.

91
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,280
So we're going to use something
called the chain rule.

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,390
And I'm just going to give you
a bunch of examples before I

93
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,060
even show you the definition
of the chain rule.

94
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,330
Because I think this is
something that you just

95
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,260
have to learn by example.

96
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,110
So the chain rule just tells us
that the derivative of let's

97
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,820
say this function right here.

98
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,100
You take the derivative of the
subfunctions, and then you can

99
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,010
But I think when you introduce
it formally, it gets

100
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,890
more confusing.

101
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,455
So what I do, I just take the
derivative of 2x plus 3 first.

102
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,510
So I take the derivative
of 2x plus 3.

103
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,350
What's the derivative
of 2x plus 3?

104
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,130
Well you know that.

105
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,470
It's just the derivative
of 2x, which is 2.

106
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,860
And then the
derivative of 3 is 0.

107
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,300
So the derivative of
2x plus 3 is just 2.

108
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,030
And then I'm going to multiply
that times the derivative

109
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,150
of the whole thing.

110
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,930
And I just pretend like
2x plus 3 is just like

111
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,060
a variable by itself.

112
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,620
So then what's the derivative
of x to the fifth?

113
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,630
Well the derivative of x to the
fifth-- I'm going to do that in

114
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,366
a different color-- the
derivative of x to the

115
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:05,590
fifth is 5x to the fourth.

116
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:13,270
So it'll be 5 times
something to the fourth.

117
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,760
But here we didn't take the
derivative of x the fifth.

118
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,010
We took the derivative of
2x plus 3 to the fifth.

119
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,280
So we just put the 2x
plus 3 there instead.

120
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,230
134
00:06:24,23 --> 00:06:26,19
So what did we do here?

121
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,290
We went in the inside of
the function, and we took

122
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:29,860
the derivative here.

123
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,570
And the derivative of
2x plus 3 was just 2.

124
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,570
And then we multiplied
it by the derivative of

125
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,460
the greater function.

126
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,980
And we just pretended like the
2x plus 3 was a variable.

127
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,120
It was like x.

128
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,410
So instead of 5x to the
fourth, we got 5 times

129
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,170
2x plus 3 to the fourth.

130
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,540
And if we just simplify that,
f prime of x is equal to

131
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:58,220
2 times 5 is 10; 10 times
2x plus 3 to the fourth.

132
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,650
That was a lot simpler than
multiplying out 2x plus 3 to

133
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,260
the fifth power, and then doing
the derivatives the old way.

134
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,080
I know this was probably a
little confusing to you,

135
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,270
so I'm going to try to do
a couple more examples.

136
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:25,570
Let's say I had g of x is equal
to x-squared plus 2x plus

137
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,620
3 to the eighth power.

138
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,430
So g prime of x is going to
equal-- well what did we say?

139
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,090
We take the derivative
of the inside.

140
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,260
This is called the chain rule.

141
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,410
What's the derivative
of the inside?

142
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:48,250
It's 2x plus 2 plus 0, right?

143
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,190
And then we take the derivative
of the whole thing.

144
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,100
And we just pretend like this
whole expression, x-squared

145
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,540
plus 2x plus 3 is just kind
of like the variable x.

146
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,590
We know that the derivative
of x to the eighth is

147
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,520
8x to the seventh.

148
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,410
So it'll be 8 times
something to the seventh.

149
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,580
And that something is this
entire expression here, 8 times

150
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,660
x-squared plus 2x plus 3.

151
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,040
I hope I didn't
confuse you too much.

152
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,790
And you can simplify
this more in any way.

153
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,900
Because it's 2x plus 2 times
8 times x-squared plus 2x

154
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,035
plus 3 to the seventh.

155
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,300
To multiply this out, or
to multiply this out is

156
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,800
a huge pain as you know.

157
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,840
But we could simplify
a little bit.

158
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,630
Let me draw a divider here.

159
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:44,526
We could say that that equals 8
times 2x, 16x plus 16 times--

160
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:48,300
I'm making it really messy--
x-squared plus 2x plus 3

161
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,610
to the seventh power.

162
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,870
I hope I didn't
confuse you too much.

163
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,920
In the next presentation, I'm
just going to do a ton of

164
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,500
examples using the chain rule.

165
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,850
And I think the more examples
you see, it's going to

166
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,470
hit the point home.

167
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,440
And then after I've done a
bunch of examples, then I'm

168
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,960
going to give you a
formal definition.

169
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,190
I think that's actually an
easier way to digest the chain

170
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,970
rule than giving you the formal
definition first, and then

171
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,440
showing you a bunch
of examples.

172
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,520
So I'll see you in the
next presentation.

173
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,400
