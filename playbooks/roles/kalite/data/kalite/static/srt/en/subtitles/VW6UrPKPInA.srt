00:00:00,614 --> 00:00:02,329
I've got five numbers here

2
00:00:02,329 --> 00:00:08,707
and the goal is to order them from least to greatest.

3
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:10,245
And it might be obvious to you

4
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:13,076
that all five of these numbers are negative numbers.

5
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:16,733
So let's just think about which of these is the greatest number.

6
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,733
And you might be tempted to say:

7
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:21,052
"Ah well, you know - 40 - if these were all positive:

8
00:00:21,052 --> 00:00:22,137
40 would be the greatest."

9
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:24,759
So you might be tempted to say "negative 40 is the greatest."

10
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:28,235
But you have to realize what the negative is telling you.

11
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:30,134
And think about that, think about...

12
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:33,467
if these were your dollar amounts in your bank account...

13
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,233
...would you rather have negative $40 in your bank account

14
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:39,000
or negative $7 in your bank account?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,563
Negative 40 means that you owe the bank $40,

16
00:00:42,563 --> 00:00:44,867
so it's $40 less than having nothing.

17
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:48,669
Negative 7 would mean that you owed the bank only $7,

18
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:53,067
so it's actually the case that -40 is less than -7, and

19
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:56,750
out of all of these numbers, it is the least of all of them.

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,793
So -40 is the very least,

21
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,836
and you can view that as the least amount of money

22
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:04,087
that you would want, out of these comparisons,

23
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:05,836
in your bank account, or the smallest amount of money.

24
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:07,225
You owe the bank $40.

25
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:09,600
Not only do you have nothing, you <i>owe</i> the bank $40.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,066
Then the next smallest number would be -30,

27
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:20,533
and then the next smallest after that would be -25,

28
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:27,979
and then the next smallest after that would be -10,

29
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:31,569
and then finally the greatest of all of these numbers

30
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:34,668
(--the greatest, and I will do it in pink--)

31
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:37,919
...the greatest of all of these numbers is -7.

32
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,660
And if it's still not obvious to you,

33
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,963
you could also think of them in temperature,

34
00:01:40,963 --> 00:01:41,990
in temperature terms.

35
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,784
Which of these is the coldest temperature?

36
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:46,200
(whether you're talking about Celsius or Fahrenheit)

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,633
<i>-40</i> would be the coldest temperature,

38
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:51,067
and -7 would be the warmest temperature.

39
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:54,200
There would be the most heat in the air at -7.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,600
Another way to think about it is we could draw a number-line.

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,533
--So let's draw a number line right over here--

42
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:04,575
If this is a zero, and you know, we could put maybe +7 up here,

43
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,621
+7 isn't one of these numbers,

44
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,528
but we can plot all the other numbers.

45
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,461
So this right here might be -7.

46
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:15,456
If that's -7 then maybe this right over here would be -10.

47
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:19,384
Notice we go further and further to the left of the zero,

48
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:25,000
and then we go a little bit further to the left we get -25...

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,394
A little bit further to the left than that is -30.

50
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:36,533
Then you go even further to the left and you get to -40.

51
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,119
If you think about it this way,

52
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:40,841
the least of these numbers is the one that's furthest to the left

53
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,067
on the number line,

54
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:45,508
and the greatest is the one furthest to the right.
