1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,750
In the last video, I drew this
grid in order to understand

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,180
better the different
combinations of alleles I

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,400
could get from my
mom or my dad.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,310
And this grid that I drew is
called a Punnett square.

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:17,000
   

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,650
And I looked up what Punnett
means, and it turns out, and

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,050
this might be the biggest
takeaway from this video, that

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,370
when you go to the farmers'
market or you go to the

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,840
produce and you see those little
baskets, you see those

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,370
little baskets that often you'll
see maybe strawberries

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,760
or blueberries sitting in, they
have this little grid

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
here, right there.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,150
Sometimes grapes are in them,
and you have a bunch of

15
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,530
strawberries in them
like that.

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,770
That green basket
is a punnett.

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,590
That's a punnett.

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,500
Apparently, in some countries,
they call it a punnett.

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,460
I think England's one of them,
and you UK viewers can correct

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,190
me if I'm wrong.

21
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,640
And so I guess that's where
the inspiration comes for

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,300
calling these Punnett squares,
that these are kind of these

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,380
little green baskets that
you can throw different

24
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,640
combinations of genotypes in.

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,140
And these Punnett squares
aren't just useful.

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,780
If you're talking about crossing
two hybrids, this is

27
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,140
called a monohybrid cross
because you are crossing two

28
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,970
hybrids for only one trait.

29
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,370
It could be useful for a whole
set of different types of

30
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:25,000
crosses between two reproducing
organisms. It

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,450
doesn't even have to be a
situation where one thing is

32
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,420
dominating another.

33
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,310
Let's do a bunch of these,
just to make you

34
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,600
familiar with the idea.

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,730
So let's say you have a mom.

36
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,910
So instead of doing two hybrids,
let's say the mom--

37
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,160
I'll keep using the blue-eyed,
brown-eyed analogy just

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,830
because we're already reasonably
useful to it.

39
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,670
Let's say that she's homozygous
dominant.

40
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:56,160
And let's say that the dad is a
heterozygote, so he's got a

41
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,020
brown and he's got a blue.

42
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,370
And we want to know the
different combinations of

43
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,400
genotypes that one of their
children might have. So what

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,392
we do is we draw a Punnett
square again.

45
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:13,550
Let me draw a grid here and
draw a grid right there.

46
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,720
And up here, we'll write the
different genes that mom can

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,510
contribute, and here, we'll
write the different genes that

48
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,960
dad can contribute, or the
different alleles.

49
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,770
I didn't want to write gene.

50
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,160
I wanted to write dad.

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,610
So the mom in either case is
either going to contribute

52
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,150
this big B brown allele from
one of the homologous

53
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,320
chromosomes, or on the other
homologous, well, they have

54
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,430
the same allele so she's
going to contribute

55
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,840
that one to her child.

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,900
The dad could contribute this
one, that big brown-eyed-- the

57
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,230
capital B allele for brown eyes
or the lowercase b for

58
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,970
blue eyes, either one.

59
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,730
So the different combinations
that might happen, an

60
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,080
offspring could get both of
these brown alleles from one

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,210
copy from both parents.

62
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,060
This could also happen where you
get this brown allele from

63
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,750
the dad and then the other brown
allele from the mom, or

64
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,820
you could get a brown allele
from the mom and a blue-eyed

65
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,080
allele from the dad, or you
could get the other brown-eyed

66
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,240
allele from the mom, right?

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,240
When the mom has this, she has
two chromosomes, homologous

68
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,800
chromosomes.

69
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,140
Each of them have the same
brown allele on them.

70
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,010
They both have that same brown
allele, so I could get the

71
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,410
other one from my mom and
still get this blue-eyed

72
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,000
allele from my dad.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,070
So if you said what's the
probability of having a

74
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,140
blue-eyed child, assuming that
blue eyes are recessive?

75
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,820
And remember, this
is a phenotype.

76
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,330
These particular combinations
are genotypes.

77
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,860
Well, in order to have blue
eyes, you have to be

78
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,250
homozygous recessive.

79
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,440
You have to have two
lowercase b's.

80
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,490
So what's the probability
of having this?

81
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,410
Well, there are no combinations
that result in

82
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,330
that, so there's a 0%
probability of having two

83
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,510
blue-eyed children.

84
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,170
What's the probability
of having a

85
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,850
homozygous dominant child?

86
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,600
Let me write that.

87
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:17,089
A homozygous dominant.

88
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,860
And now we're looking
at the genotype.

89
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,589
We care about the
specific alleles

90
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,740
that that child inherits.

91
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,880
Well, which of these are
homozygous dominant?

92
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,530
Well, you have this one right
here and you have that one

93
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,200
right there, and so two of
the four equally likely

94
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,770
combinations are homozygous
dominant, so

95
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,090
you have a 50% shot.

96
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,440
And we can do these
Punnett squares.

97
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,800
They don't even have to be for
situations where one trait is

98
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,240
necessarily dominant
on the other.

99
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,630
For example, you could have the
situation-- it's called

100
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,880
incomplete dominance.

101
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:59,330
   

102
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:05,650
Let's say you have two traits
for color in a flower.

103
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,260
You could have red flowers or
you could have white flowers.

104
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,160
   

105
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:23,170
And let's say I were to cross
a parent flower that has the

106
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,130
genotype capital R-- I'll just
make it in a capital W.

107
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,110
So that could be the mom or the
dad, although the analogy

108
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,800
breaks down a little bit with
parents, although there is a

109
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,170
male and female, although
sometimes on the same plant.

110
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,680
And let's say the other plant
is also a red and white.

111
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,490
The other plant has
a red allele and

112
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,020
also has a white allele.

113
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,870
So what are the different
possibilities?

114
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,200
Well, we just draw our
Punnett square again.

115
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,830
Let me draw our little grid.

116
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,711
So the child could inherit both
of these red alleles.

117
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:02,690
He could inherit this white
allele and then this red

118
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,720
allele, so this red one and then
this white one, right?

119
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,050
That's that right there
and that red one

120
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,290
is that right there.

121
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,190
Or it could inherit this red one
from-- let's say this is

122
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,810
the mom plant and then the
white allele from the dad

123
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,990
plant, so that's that
one right there.

124
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,660
Or you could inherit
both white alleles.

125
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,710
What I said when I went into
this, and I wrote it at the

126
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,570
top right here, is we're
studying a situation dealing

127
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,300
with incomplete dominance.

128
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,660
So what does that mean?

129
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,540
Well, that means you might
actually have mixing or

130
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,120
blending of the traits when
you actually look at them.

131
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,800
So if this was complete
dominance, if red was dominant

132
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,330
to white, then you'd say, OK,
all of these guys are going to

133
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,770
be red and only this guy right
here is going to be white, so

134
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,260
you have a one in four
probability to being white.

135
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,130
But let's say that a
heterozygous genotype-- so let

136
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,530
me write that down.

137
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:05,360
Let's say when you have one R
allele and one white allele,

138
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,150
that this doesn't
result in red.

139
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,400
This results in pink.

140
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,660
   

141
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,860
So this is what blending is.

142
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,320
It's kind of a mixture
of the two.

143
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,650
So if I said if these these two
plants were to reproduce,

144
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,060
and the traits for red and white
petals, I guess we could

145
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,170
say, are incomplete dominant,
or incompletely dominant, or

146
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,840
they blend, and if I were to say
what's the probability of

147
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,650
having a pink plant?

148
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,580
And now when I'm talking
about pink, this, of

149
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,140
course, is a phenotype.

150
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,490
So the probability of pink,
well, let's look at the

151
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,940
different combinations.

152
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,550
How many of these are pink?

153
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,750
This one is pink and
this is pink.

154
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,580
So two are pink of a total
of four equally likely

155
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:59,120
combinations, so it's a 50%
chance that we're pink.

156
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,970
And we could keep doing this
over multiple generations, and

157
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,170
say, oh, what happens in the
second and third and the

158
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,830
fourth generation?

159
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,830
Actually, we could even have
a situation where we have

160
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,180
multiple different alleles, and
I'll use almost a kind of

161
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,690
a more realistic example.

162
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,690
I'll use blood types
as an example.

163
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,526
So there's three potential
alleles for blood type.

164
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:22,150
   

165
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,880
You can have a blood type A, you
could have a blood type B,

166
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,655
or you could have
a blood type O.

167
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:32,580
   

168
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,230
What happens is you have a
combination here between

169
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,840
codominance and recessive
genes.

170
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,440
And I'm going to show you what
I talk about when we do the

171
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,260
Punnett squares.

172
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,230
Maybe I'll stick to one color
here because I think you're

173
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,530
getting the idea.

174
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,430
So let's say I have a
parent who is AB.

175
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,820
So that means that they have
on one of their homologous

176
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,980
chromosomes, they have the A
allele, and on the other one,

177
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,160
they have the B allele.

178
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,720
That's what AB means.

179
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,240
So the phenotype is
the genotype.

180
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,270
They're codominant.

181
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,230
They both express themselves.

182
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,370
They don't necessarily blend.

183
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,300
They both express.

184
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,570
That's an AB blood type.

185
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,390
Let me write this right here.

186
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,740
This is AB blood type.

187
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,490
   

188
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:23,200
And then the other parent is--
let's say that they are fully

189
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,420
an A blood type.

190
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,050
Let's say they're
an A blood type.

191
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,970
Let's say their phenotype is an
A blood type-- I hope I'm

192
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,190
not confusing you-- but their
genotype is that they have one

193
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,350
allele that's an A and their
other allele that's an O.

194
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,200
So this is what's interesting
about blood types.

195
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,220
It's a mixture.

196
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,710
O is recessive.

197
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,050
O is recessive, while these
guys are codominant.

198
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,650
So if you have either of
these guys with an

199
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,510
O, these guys dominate.

200
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,140
If you have them together, then
your blood type is AB.

201
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,180
So what are all the different
combinations for these for

202
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,580
this couple here?

203
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,360
   

204
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,570
Well, you could get this A and
that A, so you get an A from

205
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,990
your mom and you get an A from
your dad right there.

206
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,020
And clearly in this case, your
phenotype, you will have an A

207
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,000
blood type in this situation.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,960
You could get the A from your
dad and you could get the B

209
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,580
from your mom, in which case
you have an AB blood type.

210
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,030
You could get the A from your
mom and the O from your dad,

211
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,360
in which case you have an A
blood type because this

212
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,930
dominates that.

213
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,770
Or you could get the B from
your-- I dont want to

214
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,080
introduce arbitrary colors.

215
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:49,300
You could get the B from your
mom, that's this one, or the O

216
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,490
from your dad.

217
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,490
No, once again, I introduced
a different color.

218
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,920
And this is a B blood type.

219
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:02,650
So if I said what's the
probability of having an AA

220
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,980
blood type?

221
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,460
And once again, we're talking
about a phenotype here.

222
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,220
So which of these are
an A blood type?

223
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,800
This one definitely is,
because it's AA.

224
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,640
If you have two A alleles,
you'll definitely have an A

225
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,750
blood type, but you also have
an A blood type phenotype if

226
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,020
you have an A and then an O.

227
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,430
O is recessive.

228
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,690
So this is also going to
be an A blood type.

229
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:36,010
So these are both A blood, so
there's a 50% chance, because

230
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,880
two of the four combinations
show us an A blood type.

231
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,570
And you could do all of the
different combinations.

232
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,950
You say, well, how do you
have an O blood type?

233
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,450
Well, both of your parents
will have to carry

234
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,520
at least one O.

235
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,300
So, for example, to have a--
that would've been possible if

236
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,090
maybe instead of an AB, this
right here was an O, then this

237
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,380
combination would've been
two O's right there.

238
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,660
So hopefully, that gives you
an idea of how a Punnett

239
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,960
square can be useful, and it can
even be useful when we're

240
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,110
talking about more
than one trait.

241
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,970
So let's go to our situation
that I talked about before

242
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:18,040
where I said you have little b
is equal to blue eyes, and

243
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,790
we're assuming that that's
recessive, and you have big B

244
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,530
is equal to brown eyes,
and we're assuming

245
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,780
that this is dominant.

246
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,980
   

247
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,346
And let's say we have
another trait.

248
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:34,820
   

249
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,750
I introduced that tooth
trait before.

250
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,780
So let's say little t is
equal to small teeth.

251
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,790
   

252
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,290
I don't know what type of
bizarre organism I'm talking

253
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,310
about, although I think
I would fall into

254
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,830
the big tooth camp.

255
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,330
Let's say big T is equal
to big teeth.

256
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,010
   

257
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,330
So an individual can have--
for example, I might be

258
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:05,050
heterozygous brown eyes, so my
genotype might be heterozygous

259
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,740
for brown eyes and then
homozygous dominant for teeth.

260
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,500
So this might be my genotype.

261
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,680
And the phenotype for this one
would be a big-toothed,

262
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,810
brown-eyed person, right?

263
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,820
Let me make that clear.

264
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,160
This is big tooth phenotype.

265
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,260
   

266
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,120
And this is the phenotype.

267
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,760
What you see is brown eyes.

268
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,690
A big-toothed, brown-eyed
person.

269
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,790
Now if we assume that the genes
that code for teeth or

270
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,630
eye color are on different
chromosomes, and this is a key

271
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,160
assumption, we can say that
they assort independently.

272
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,915
Let me write that down:
independent assortment.

273
00:13:46,915 --> 00:14:00,060
   

274
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,310
So this is a case where if I
were look at my chromosomes,

275
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,230
let's say this is one homologous
pair, maybe we call

276
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,060
that homologous pair 1, and
let's say I have another

277
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,270
homologous pair, and obviously
we have 23 of these, but let's

278
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:23,840
say this is homologous pair 2
right here, if the eye color

279
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,270
gene is here and here, remember
both homologous

280
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,360
chromosomes code for
the same genes.

281
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,060
They might have different
versions.

282
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,160
Those are alleles.

283
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,720
And if teeth are over here,
they will assort

284
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,520
independently.

285
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,910
So after meiosis occurs to
produce the gametes, the

286
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,370
offspring might get this
chromosome or a copy of that

287
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,170
chromosome for eye color and
might get a copy of this

288
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,060
chromosome for teeth
size or tooth size.

289
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,410
Or it could go the other way.

290
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,220
Maybe another offspring gets
this one, this chromosome for

291
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,590
eye color, and then this
chromosome for teeth color and

292
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,570
gets the other version
of the allele.

293
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,680
So because they're on different
chromosomes, there's

294
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,890
no linkage between if you
inherit this one, whether you

295
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,990
inherit big teeth, whether
you're going to inherit small

296
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,850
brown eyes or blue eyes.

297
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,120
Now, if they were on the same
chromosomee-- let's say the

298
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,410
situation where they are
on the same chromosome.

299
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,350
So let me pick another
trait: hair color.

300
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,130
   

301
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,180
Let's say the gene for hair
color is on chromosome 1, so

302
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,250
let's say hair color, the
gene is there and there.

303
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,060
These might be different
versions of hair color,

304
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,950
different alleles, but the
genes are on that same

305
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,860
chromosome.

306
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,520
In this situation, if someone
gets-- let's say if this is

307
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,200
blue eyes here and this is blond
hair, then these are

308
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,910
going always travel together.

309
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,370
You're not going to have these
assort independently.

310
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,010
And these are called
linked traits.

311
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,560
Let me highlight that.

312
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,730
So these right there, those
are linked traits.

313
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,180
But for a second, and we'll talk
more about linked traits,

314
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,140
and especially sex-linked traits
in probably the next

315
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,520
video or a few videos from now,
but let's assume that

316
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,000
we're talking about traits that
assort independently, and

317
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,150
we cross two hybrids.

318
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,350
So this is called a
dihybrid cross.

319
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,600
Very fancy word, but it just
gives you an idea of the power

320
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,170
of the Punnett square.

321
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:35,490
So let's say both parents are--
so they're both hybrids,

322
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:41,730
which means that they both have
the dominant brown-eye

323
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,410
allele and they have the
recessive blue-eye allele, and

324
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,360
they both have the dominant
big-tooth gene and they both

325
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,570
have the recessive little
tooth gene.

326
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,300
So this is the genotype
for both parents.

327
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,440
Both parents are dihybrid.

328
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,980
They're hybrids for both
genes, both parents.

329
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,980
What are all the different

330
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,920
combinations for their children?

331
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,300
And I could have done this
without dihybrids.

332
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,490
I could have made one of them
homozygous for one of the

333
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,000
traits and a hybrid for the
other, and I could have done

334
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,200
every different combination,
but I'll do the dihybrid,

335
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,780
because it leads to a lot of our
variety, and you'll often

336
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,630
see this in classes.

337
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:29,160
So if I'm talking about the mom,
what are the different

338
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,930
combinations of genes that
the mom can contribute?

339
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,770
Well, the mom could contribute
the brown-- so for each of

340
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,390
these traits, she can only
contribute one of the alleles.

341
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,660
So she could contribute this
brown right here and then the

342
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,670
big yellow T, so this is one
combination, or she could

343
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:59,140
contribute the big brown and
then the little yellow t, or

344
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,670
she can contribute
the blue-eyed

345
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,160
allele and the big T.

346
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,040
So these are all the different
combinations that she could

347
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,000
contribute.

348
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,210
And then the final combination
is this allele and that

349
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:16,370
allele, so the blue eyes
and the small teeth.

350
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,180
So that's from mom.

351
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,050
And, of course, dad could
contribute the same different

352
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,900
combinations because dad
has the same genotype.

353
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,060
Let me write that down.

354
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,250
Let me just write it like this
so I don't have to keep

355
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,130
switching colors.

356
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,850
Actually, I want to make them
a little closer together

357
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,490
because I'm going to run
out of space otherwise.

358
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,870
Nope.

359
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,400
Let me do it like that.

360
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,320
OK, brown eyes, so the dad could
contribute the big teeth

361
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,190
or the little teeth, z along
with the brown-eyed gene, or

362
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,510
he could contribute the
blue-eyed gene, the blue-eyed

363
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,710
allele in combination with the
big teeth or the yellow teeth.

364
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,940
Not the yellow teeth,
the little teeth.

365
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
That would be a different gene
for yellow teeth or maybe

366
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,600
that's an environmental
factor.

367
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,270
So these are all the different
combinations that can occur

368
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,530
for their offspring.

369
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,790
So let's draw-- call this maybe
a super Punnett square,

370
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,250
because we're now dealing
with, instead of four

371
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:20,030
combinations, we have
16 combinations.

372
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,160
It looks like I ran out
of ink right there.

373
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,230
It's strange why--
16 combinations.

374
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,080
Let me write that out.

375
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,860
Something's wrong
with my tablet.

376
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,790
Maybe there's something weird.

377
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,350
OK, so there's 16 different
combinations, and let's write

378
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,870
them all out, and I'll just
stay in one maybe neutral

379
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,490
color so I don't have
to keep switching.

380
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,500
I could get this combination,
so this brown eyes from my

381
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,410
mom, brown eyes from my dad
allele, so its brown-brown,

382
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,510
and then big teeth from both.

383
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,870
I could have this combination,
so I have capital B

384
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,830
and a capital B.

385
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,580
And then I have a capital
T and a lowercase t.

386
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,000
And then let's just keep
moving forward.

387
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,630
So I could get a capital B and a
lowercase B with a capital T

388
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:16,070
and a capital T, a big B,
lowercase B, capital T

389
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,350
lowercase t.

390
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,780
And I'm just going to go through
these super-fast

391
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,920
because it's going to take
forever, so capital B from

392
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,130
here, capital B from there;
capital T, lowercase t from

393
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:32,150
here; capital B from each and
then lowercase t from each.

394
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,220
You have a capital B and then
a lowercase b from that one,

395
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,760
and then a capital T from the
mom, lowercase t from the dad.

396
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,070
Hopefully, you're not getting
too tired here.

397
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,730
And so then you have the capital
B from your dad and

398
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,060
then lowercase b
from your mom.

399
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,980
Two lowercase t's-- actually
let me just pause and fill

400
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,320
these in because I don't want
to waste your time.

401
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,400
There I have saved you some time
and I've filled in every

402
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,750
combination similar to what
happens on many cooking shows.

403
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,290
But now that I've filled
in all the different

404
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,850
combinations, we can talk a
little bit about the different

405
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,000
phenotypes that might
be expressed from

406
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,860
this dihybrid cross.

407
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,990
For example, how many of these
are going to exhibit brown

408
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,620
eyes and big teeth?

409
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,780
So big teeth, brown-eyed kids.

410
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,340
   

411
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,110
Let me write this down here.

412
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:27,190
So if I want big teeth
and brown eyes.

413
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,590
   

414
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,480
All of a sudden, my pen
doesn't-- brown eyes.

415
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,500
So how many are there?

416
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,880
Big teeth and brown eyes.

417
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,450
So they're both dominant, so if
you have either a capital B

418
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,490
or a capital T in any of them,
you're going to have big teeth

419
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,410
and brown eyes, so this is
big teeth and brown eyes.

420
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,820
Big teeth right here,
brown eyes there.

421
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,700
Or maybe I should just say
brown eyes and big teeth

422
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,250
because that's the order that
I wrote it right here.

423
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,780
Brown eyes and big teeth, brown
eyes and big teeth.

424
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,370
Even though I have a recessive
trait here,

425
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,620
the brown eyes dominate.

426
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,350
I had a small teeth here, but
the big teeth dominate.

427
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,820
This is brown eyes
and big teeth.

428
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,200
This is brown eyes
and big teeth.

429
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,700
Let's see, this is brown eyes
and big teeth, brown eyes and

430
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,660
big teeth, and let me see,
is that all of them?

431
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,360
Well, no.

432
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,180
This is brown eyes
and little teeth.

433
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,850
This is brown eyes and big teeth
right there, and this is

434
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,160
also brown eyes and big teeth.

435
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,450
They're heterozygous for each
trait, but both brown eyes and

436
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,720
big teeth are dominant, so these
are all phenotypes of

437
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,890
brown eyes and big teeth.

438
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,160
So how many of those
do we have?

439
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,740
We have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

440
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,430
eight, nine of those.

441
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,030
So we have nine.

442
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,840
Nine brown eyes and big teeth.

443
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,810
Now, how many do we
have of big teeth?

444
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,630
   

445
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,350
Let me write in a different
color, so let me write brown

446
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,880
eyes and little teeth.

447
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,820
   

448
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,350
Something on my pen tablet
doesn't work

449
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,560
quite right over there.

450
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,970
So brown eyes and
little teeth.

451
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,500
So let's see, this
is brown eyes and

452
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,100
little teeth right there.

453
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,270
This is brown eyes and little
teeth right there.

454
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,280
This is brown eyes and little
teeth right there.

455
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,070
So there's three combinations
of brown

456
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,010
eyes and little teeth.

457
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:31,810
And if I were to say blue eyes,
blue and big teeth, what

458
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,900
are the combinations there?

459
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,750
Well, this is blue eyes and big
teeth, blue eyes and big

460
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,650
teeth, blue eyes and big
teeth, so there's three

461
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,110
combinations there.

462
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,210
And if I want to be recessive on
both traits, so if I want--

463
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,480
let me do this.

464
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,490
I want blue eyes, blue
and little teeth.

465
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,900
   

466
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,090
There's only one.

467
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,250
Out of the 16, there's only one
situation where I inherit

468
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:05,490
the recessive trait from both
parents for both traits.

469
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,310
So if you look at this, and
you say, hey, what's the

470
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,920
probability-- there's only
one of that-- what's the

471
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,590
probability of having a big
teeth, brown-eyed child?

472
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,240
And these are all
the phenotypes.

473
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,240
There were 16 different
possibilities here, right?

474
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,640
There are 16 squares here, and
9 of them describe the

475
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,860
phenotype of big teeth
and brown eyes, so

476
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,420
there's a 9/16 chance.

477
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,090
So it's 9 out of 16 chance
of having a big

478
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,830
teeth, brown-eyed child.

479
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,090
What's the probability
of a blue-eyed

480
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,700
child with little teeth?

481
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,080
1 in 16.

482
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,010
So hopefully, in this video,
you've appreciated the power

483
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,530
of the Punnett square, that it's
a useful way to explore

484
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,340
every different combination of
all the genes, and it doesn't

485
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,560
have to be only one trait.

486
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,440
It can be in this case where
you're doing two traits that

487
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,300
show dominance, but they assort
independently because

488
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,840
they're on different
chromosomes.

489
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,560
You could use it-- where'd
I do it over here?

490
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,260
You could use it to explore
incomplete dominance when

491
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,870
there's blending, where red and
white made pink genes, or

492
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,820
you can even use it when there's
codominance and when

493
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,110
you have multiple alleles,
where it's not just two

494
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,640
different versions of the genes,
there's actually three

495
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,730
different versions.

496
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,120
So hopefully, you've
enjoyed that.
