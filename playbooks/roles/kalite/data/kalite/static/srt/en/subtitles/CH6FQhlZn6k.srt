1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,390
In the last video, we saw
Napoleon's army get decimated,

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,080
especially as they tried
to retreat from Russia.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,640
The numbers I threw out in that
video as he started off

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,005
were on the order of 450,000
soldiers under his command.

5
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:16,470
And then when he retreated,
it was on the

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,920
order of 10,000 soldiers.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,230
I just want to take a
little aside here.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,060
These numbers aren't firm.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,470
Historians aren't even sure
on the exact numbers.

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,750
And sometimes you'll see
accounts of 500,000 to 600,000

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,550
entering and 30,000
to 40,000 leaving.

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,140
I went with these numbers just
because on Minard's map, these

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,450
were pretty close to
those numbers.

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,540
Right here he has 422,000.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,140
Leaving he has 10,000
right there.

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,510
But I just want to make sure you
realize that these aren't

17
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,520
exact numbers.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,750
And depending on, I guess, how
you account for his troops,

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,770
whether you're talking about
troops directly under

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,060
Napoleon's command, whether
they are troops that are

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,460
directly involved in the
offensive invasion of Russia.

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,520
Or they're just troops that
are maybe supporting it.

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,760
You're going to get
different numbers.

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,290
And depending on whether you
view troops and how you count

25
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,820
the casualties.

26
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,080
So it's all about
how you count.

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,960
But needless to say, the
French grand army was

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,220
decimated after invading
Russia.

29
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,630
And I even told you, at the end
of the last video, that

30
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,220
after that, the rest of Europe,
these other countries

31
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,080
that kept forming and reforming
coalitions against

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,910
Napoleon, began to
smell blood.

33
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,670
So you can already view the
invasion of Russia as the

34
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,370
beginning of the Sixth
Coalition.

35
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,600
You already had Great Britain.

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,620
Great Britain throughout this
entire time period, throughout

37
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,940
the Napoleonic Wars, and even
during the French Revolution,

38
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,670
was in a constant state of war
with the French and Napoleon.

39
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:51,140
Obviously, you have Russia now
is also a belligerent, is also

40
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,350
an antagonist against
Napoleon.

41
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,840
Just because he retreated
doesn't mean the war with

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,310
Russia is over.

43
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,650
Prussia had been humiliated
multiple times by Napoleon.

44
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,560
And now they jump on the
bandwagon after hearing about

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,380
Napoleon getting decimated.

46
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,000
And so they, a combined Russian
and Prussian forces,

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,920
engage Napoleon.

48
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,040
But as much as Napoleon's forces
seem to have gotten

49
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,930
decimated--

50
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,670
So if you look at that Minard
map up here that we went over

51
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,220
in some detail in the last
video, that covers right here.

52
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,320
The invasion of Russia started
right about here, and it went

53
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,460
right about in that direction
right there.

54
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,360
So Napoleon, he's now
retreating back.

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,210
You might say, gee, he
only has 10,000 or

56
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,860
20,000 or 30,000 troops.

57
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,730
That's nothing.

58
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,490
He's just going to be put out
very quickly by the combined

59
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,300
allied forces.

60
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,220
But Napoleon, as we kind of say,
regardless of what you

61
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,270
think of him as a person,
he was no dummy.

62
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,900
And he was good at
raising forces.

63
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,820
And he was a very, very, very
good military tactition.

64
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,930
He was very quickly able to
raise, to take his 30,000

65
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,930
soldier army, get
it to 130,000.

66
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,800
And eventually he's able
to get it to 400,000.

67
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,380
Although this force right here,
it's not going to be the

68
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,030
same quality of 400,000 as the
400,000 that he might have

69
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,260
had, say, entering the
Russian campaign.

70
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,600
And there were other
troops also that

71
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,890
were allied with Napoleon.

72
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,540
German troops from the
Confederacy of the Rhine that

73
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,880
were sympathetic to
the French Empire.

74
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,760
But once again, they weren't
as disciplined or under as

75
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,230
direct control of Napoleon.

76
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,700
But, it's needless to say, he
was able to very quickly get

77
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,720
up to some reasonable force that
could maybe withstand a

78
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,880
Sixth Coalition.

79
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,510
But the Sixth Coalition
was much larger.

80
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,370
It's on the order of, depending
on the account you

81
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,480
look at, they amassed forces
mainly in what's now Germany--

82
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,680
but at that time, the
Confederation of the Rhine.

83
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,390
And before that, the Holy Roman
Empire-- of on the order

84
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,180
of 1 million troops.

85
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,350
Not $1 million.

86
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,860
One million soldiers.

87
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,360
So even though Napoleon was able
to raise a force, he was

88
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,620
still out numbered in what's now
Germany, or the Germanic

89
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,940
kingdoms. He was still out
numbered by a factor of 2:1.

90
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,940
But despite that, the first
several engagements with the

91
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,709
combined Russian and Prussian
army, Napoleon was victorious.

92
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,530
Or I shouldn't say victorious,
because that implies too much.

93
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,540
He won those battles.

94
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:34,080
And these are at Lutzen,
at Bautzen.

95
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,770
And then at Dresden, he had a
very significant victory.

96
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,270
And these are all right about
here, just so you have a sense

97
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,280
of the geography.

98
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,840
You can actually see Dresden
on the map there.

99
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,820
And after these defeats, the
Coalition said gee, this

100
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,170
Napoleon character, even though
we outnumber him, even

101
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,460
though he had to kind of very
quickly get these troops, he's

102
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,900
a really good military
tactition.

103
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,020
And he's still kind of kicking
our butt on the battlefield.

104
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,140
They then issued what's called
the-- let me write this

105
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,100
down--the Trachtenberg Plan.

106
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,510
Although it's not clear that
they really had to.

107
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,180
The Trachtenberg Plan, which
essentially says, try not to

108
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,230
engage forces that Napoleon
is in command of directly.

109
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,340
Try to engage his people
that Napoleon has

110
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,250
had to delegate to.

111
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,610
His marshalls, the
other generals.

112
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:31,520
So don't engage Napoleon.

113
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,455
One day I'd like to make more
detailed videos on the actual

114
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:38,240
kind of-- you have to say-- the
actual genius of Napoleon

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,190
on the battlefield.

116
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,350
And go battle by battle and
see why people consider

117
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,670
Napoleon to be a great
military commander.

118
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,020
But his enemies definitely
appreciated the fact that,

119
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,030
despite being outnumbered, he
was very tricky and very wily,

120
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,930
and was always able
to kind of snatch

121
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,200
victory from the defeat.

122
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,690
So they had this plan, let's
just not engage Napoleon.

123
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,260
We have so many troops, let's
just try to incur losses on

124
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,110
the French on other commanders
other than Napoleon.

125
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,360
But needless to say, they hugely
outnumbered the French.

126
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,750
All of the fighting was
going on in this

127
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,380
general area at the time.

128
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,710
And at Leipzig, and just so
you get a sense of time.

129
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,410
Remember, the invasion of Russia
was at the end of 18--

130
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,550
So let me write this down.

131
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:36,070
So the Russian invasion-- let
me do this in another color.

132
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,450
Do it right here.

133
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:48,020
So the Russian invasion, that
was at the end of 1812.

134
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,310
That was really kind of the
beginning of winter in 1812

135
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,660
that really decimated
Napoleon's troops.

136
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,270
Then we go to 1813, you're
looking at Lutzen and Bautzen.

137
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,330
That's in May of 1813.

138
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,140
So after that winter, that gave
Napoleon some time to get

139
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,100
his troops together.

140
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,800
And things happened slower
this day and age.

141
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,260
People didn't have perfect
intelligence in terms of what

142
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,580
was going on in the
battlefield.

143
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,450
And it actually took time for
just information to travel,

144
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,750
and for armies to travel.

145
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,160
They were traveling mainly
on foot at that time.

146
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:35,850
And then August 1813, you had
Napoleon's significant victory

147
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,100
at Dresden.

148
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:47,870
But then finally, 1813, in
October-- and at this point

149
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,220
the Coalition had convinced
Austria to also join in.

150
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,360
So this is kind of the
ultimate coalition.

151
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,530
If you look at most of the
coalitions, they seldom had

152
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,320
bold Austria and Prussia and
Russia and all of these guys.

153
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,960
But now they're all piling on.

154
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,450
So now you have Austria.

155
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,250
Austria is part of
the Coalition.

156
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,590
And Sweden.

157
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,870
And of course, you can't forget
what's happening in the

158
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,940
Iberian Peninsula.

159
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,090
You have all of the rebels
in Spain and Portugal.

160
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,270
So you pretty much have every
major power in Europe is now

161
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,410
allied against Napoleon.

162
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,960
And in October of 1813,
especially the Austrians,

163
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,560
Prussians, and Russians, they
meet him at Leipzig.

164
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,460
Which is right over here.

165
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,809
And at Leipzig, they
outnumber him 2:1.

166
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,610
And they were able to
take care of him and

167
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,480
force him to retreat.

168
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,620
So then Leipzig happens, first
really major defeat.

169
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,350
This is actually an image of
the Battle of Leipzig.

170
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,230
They call it the Battle
of the Nations.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,290
Because so many belligerents
were involved in this battle.

172
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,410
People estimate that there were

173
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,810
600,000 soldiers involved.

174
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,630
400,000 thousand on the side
of the Sixth Coalition.

175
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,890
200,000 on the side
of Napoleon.

176
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:14,020
And they estimate on the order
of a 100,000 dead or wounded.

177
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,640
So this was a major, major,
super bloody battle.

178
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,430
And it forced Napoleon
to retreat.

179
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,920
So he had to retreat
from Russia before.

180
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,060
And now he's retreating from
the Confederation of the

181
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,710
Rhine, Which was essentially
French-controlled territory.

182
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,500
So Napoleon is really
on his heels.

183
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,070
He now is going to
defend France.

184
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,160
And now remember, at the same
time as this, you had that you

185
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,940
had all this stuff going
on in the peninsula.

186
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,870
You had Arthur Wellesley.

187
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,220
You remember him right here.

188
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,930
He's the British general
leading, you could view them

189
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,020
as the rebels in Spain
and Portugal.

190
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,300
At the end of 1813, he's winning
a series of victories

191
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,980
against the French.

192
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,770
And he's pushing into France.

193
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,520
This is the Pyrenees Mountains
right here.

194
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,350
He's crossing, he's winning
a series of

195
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,930
battles in the Pyrenees.

196
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,960
And then in a last-ditch effort,
Napoleon once again,

197
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,220
he's hugely outnumbered.

198
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,180
He engages his enemies in
battles in northeast France,

199
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,920
right around that area.

200
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,720
And there's actually a period,
there's this six day campaign.

201
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,660
And this now, we are in 1814.

202
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,320
So Leipzig was at
the end of 1813.

203
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,030
He retreats.

204
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,320
Now we're in 1814.

205
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,080
And at the beginning of 1814 in
February, you have the Six

206
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,330
Day Campaign.

207
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,910
And this was kind of Napoleon's
final shot at

208
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,850
really showing his
military genius.

209
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,800
Despite the fact that he was
hugely outnumbered, there were

210
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,400
four significant battles where
he was essentially able to, at

211
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,790
least in those battles, route
the Coalition, despite being

212
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,910
hugely outnumbered.

213
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,780
So he kept showing his
military genius.

214
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,050
But at some point, the numbers
just became overwhelming.

215
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,340
And the French troops just
couldn't handle the Coalition,

216
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,870
especially after being
decimated in Russia.

217
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,380
And then losing significant
troops even in some of their

218
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,650
victories in what is now
Germany, or the Confederation

219
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,120
of the Rhine then.

220
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,920
And then the allies, the
Coalition, eventually in March

221
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:25,076
of 1814, the Sixth Coalition,
marches into Paris.

222
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,270
And this right here is an image
of the Russians marching

223
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:43,760
into Paris, around
March of 1814.

224
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,520
But Napoleon didn't
want to give up.

225
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,360
In April Napoleon is telling
his generals,

226
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,470
let's go retake Paris.

227
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,940
But finally, the generals are
ready to give up on Napoleon,

228
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,760
and they refused
to follow him.

229
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,820
And then Napoleon says hey,
then I'm going to tell the

230
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,610
troops to follow me.

231
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,200
And they're like, well you could
try, but they're not

232
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,150
going to follow you.

233
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,430
So they essentially don't agree
to do anything that

234
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,630
Napoleon wants.

235
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,360
Forcing Napoleon, and it was
going to happen one way or the

236
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,870
other, this way was
just less bloody.

237
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,600
In April of 1814-- super
important time in history--

238
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,700
Napoleon is forced
to abdicate.

239
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,510
And not only does he abdicate--
maybe I'll do a

240
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,590
future video on it-- but he also
has to rescind any claim

241
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:40,250
that any of his son or any of
his future-- not the word

242
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,560
ancestors, what's the opposite
of ancestors?

243
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,210
Descendants, any of his future
descendants might have claim

244
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,740
as Emperor of France
or King of France.

245
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,630
So he's forced to abdicate.

246
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,490
Super important time, 1814.

247
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,450
So if you think about
when Napoleon ruled.

248
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:03,140
Remember, he was able to take
power at the end of 1799.

249
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,110
So it's been on the order of 13
or 14 years where Napoleon

250
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,230
has just been the absolute
ruler of France.

251
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,220
And has been able to really
kind of wreak a

252
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,360
lot of havoc on Europe.

253
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,370
And now, it all comes
to an end.

254
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,850
And we'll see, it's kind
of temporary now.

255
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,720
But we're getting near the end
of hearing about Napoleon.

256
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,830
They force them to abdicate by
the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

257
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,590
And they exile him to Elba.

258
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,060
So this is-- just so you know
where Elba is-- a little

259
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,140
island off the Italian
coast right here.

260
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,810
This is where Napoleon
was forced to stay.

261
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,690
Doesn't seem like that
bad of a place.

262
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,610
And they actually let him keep
the title of Emperor.

263
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,000
And they allowed him
to rule over Elba.

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,210
And he was actually able to
do something reasonably

265
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,770
constructive things
with the island.

266
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,980
You're going to see he leaves
the island very shortly.

267
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,050
But it wasn't that bad.

268
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,170
In modern days, if someone was
indirectly responsible, or

269
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,700
directly responsible, for
butchering millions of your

270
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,290
civilians or soldiers, you
wouldn't send him to a place

271
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,250
with a nice climate and give
him a nice house like this.

272
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,890
And allow them actually
rule over the island.

273
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,180
But I think at this time, all
of these generals and kings,

274
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,830
they all viewed each
other as gentlemen.

275
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,320
And they never wanted to be
too vicious to each other,

276
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,380
just in case things
were to come back

277
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,160
around to them, I guess.

278
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,930
But he got exiled to Elba in, as
I just said, April of 1814.

279
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,000
And then, the Coalition, we'll
talk more about this, they put

280
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Louis XVI-- you remember Louis
XVI, with the whole French

281
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,770
Revolution and the
Estates-General-- they put his

282
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,190
younger brother, they restore
him to the crown.

283
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,770
This is right here
is Louis XVIII.

284
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,560
This is Louis XVI's
younger brother.

285
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,010
They make him King of France.

286
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,080
So after all that business about
the French Revolution,

287
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,770
and then Napoleon comes to
power, and all the Rights of

288
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,840
Man and all that.

289
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,200
When everything is said
and done, they put a

290
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,910
king back in power.

291
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,710
This guy, with the satin
robes again.

292
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,150
Doesn't look too different
than his older brother.

293
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,150
And just in case you're
wondering, his older brother

294
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,510
is Louis XVI.

295
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,090
He's Louis XVIII.

296
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,870
Who was Louis XVII?

297
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,390
This is Louis XVII.

298
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,640
Right here.

299
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,560
This is Louis XVI's son, he was
actually next in line to

300
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,290
the thrown before his uncle,
or Louis XVI's younger

301
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,770
brother, Louis XVIII.

302
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,470
But he died while he
was in prison.

303
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,850
If you were a Royalist, you
would have considered him king

304
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,250
after the beheading, the
decapitation of his dad.

305
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,420
And actually, there's a hugely
fascinating story here where

306
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,300
people say that he
died in 1795.

307
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,330
But many, many people think that
he escaped and was able

308
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,340
to live a normal life.

309
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,220
And who knows what?

310
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,710
