1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
   

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,330
Let's talk a little bit about
what it means to own shares,

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,550
or stock, in a company.

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,050
I think we all have
a general sense.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,600
But what I want to do in this
video is make it a little bit

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,280
more tangible, to really
understand exactly what you're

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,420
buying when you buy
a share of stock.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,600
So the general sense, and this
is exactly what it really is,

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,570
is when you buy stock or you buy
shares you are essentially

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,180
becoming a partial, or part
owner, of the company.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,930
   

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,820
And just to contrast this with
bonds, because they are often

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,580
used in the same phrasing, oh
I'm going to go buy some

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,940
stocks or bonds, or I deal
with stocks and bonds.

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,630
Bonds, you become part lender
to the company.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:01:01,000
   

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,350
So for example, if you by a--
well I'll just say a face

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,330
value bond of, let's say it's
a thousand dollars, and

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,150
there's a thousand people
who do that.

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,680
Each of you all are lending
a thousand to the company.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,000
And since there's a thousand
of you, you're lending a

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,480
million dollars to
the company.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,300
And I'm not going to go into
detail on that, because the

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,380
focus of this is going
to be stock.

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,860
But it's good to keep in
mind that they are

26
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,030
very different things.

27
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,700
Here you're owning the company,
here you're lending

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,550
the company.

29
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,650
So just to make this a little
bit more tangible of exactly

30
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,100
what we're owning, let me draw
a simple balance sheet for

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,930
some company x.

32
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,620
So this is Company-- let me do
a new color-- let's say we're

33
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,430
dealing with Company
x right here.

34
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,185
And let's say if we looked at
Company x's assets, and when

35
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:54,510
we talk about assets, it really
is the same thing that

36
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,830
we mean in the real world or in
our everyday life when we

37
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,000
talk about assets.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,390
They are things that
have value.

39
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,080
Things that are going
to give us some

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,280
type of future benefit.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,130
A house is an asset because it
gives us the future benefit of

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,760
being able to live in it and
protecting us from cold

43
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,729
weather and rain.

44
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,960
Cars are assets because
they provide us some

45
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,800
transportation.

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,130
Cash is an asset because it can
be exchanged for things we

47
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,230
need in the future.

48
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,540
So all of these-- a loan to
someone else is an asset

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,980
because in the future they
will pay us back.

50
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,930
A loan to me is a liability,
which we'll

51
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,860
talk about in a second.

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,730
But anyway, let's just, in the
very abstract sense, say this

53
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,530
is Company x's assets.

54
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:38,400
And let's say that they're
worth $100 million.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,760
And I'm not going to go into
exactly how this number is

56
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,580
determined, or who's determining
it, or who's

57
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,030
saying this is a hundred
million.

58
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,150
But let's just say we agree that
this is how much their

59
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,060
land, and their patents, and
their copyrights, and their

60
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,240
cash, and their buildings,
and everything else

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,380
they have is worth.

62
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,780
All of the things that will
generate future value.

63
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,000
Now let's say that Company x has
also borrowed some money.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,770
And maybe they borrowed it by
issuing bonds, which I will

65
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,130
not go into detail on.

66
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,950
So let's say they borrowed
some money.

67
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:15,240
And so they owe some people,
collectively, $80 million.

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,970
This could have been a straight
debt from a bank, or

69
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,460
this could have been
via a bond issue.

70
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,400
They might have issued-- maybe
they issued a million bonds

71
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,710
where each of those essentially

72
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,560
represent a debt of $80.

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,540
I won't go into that too much,
but I think you get the idea

74
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,070
what I mean, part lender.

75
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,445
But this is debt. $80 million
of debt right here.

76
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,420
And let's say that's all
of their liabilities.

77
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,130
There are other liabilities
other than debt.

78
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,250
But for simplicity, let's say
that's their only liability,

79
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,730
and that debt tends
to be the biggest.

80
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,190
Now, what's left
for the owners?

81
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,230
And a good way to think about
that is, what would happen if

82
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,980
this company were sold and
the debt paid off?

83
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,850
So if the company were sold and
these assets really are

84
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,260
able to be sold for
$100 million.

85
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,600
You would get $100 million.

86
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,290
You'd have to pay the debt
holders, you'd have to pay off

87
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,720
the debt first. So you'd have
100 minus 80, you'd have $20

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,850
million left for the owners.

89
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,240
I'll do that in this
other green color.

90
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,190
So you'd have $20
million left.

91
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,880
   

92
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,389
And this is called the equity,
or the owners' equity.

93
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,970
   

94
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,450
And this is completely the same
idea as when people talk

95
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,990
about having equity
in a house.

96
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,990
if I have a $300,000 house and
I still have $200,000 left on

97
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,160
the mortgage, then I have
$100,000 in equity.

98
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,690
So it's completely analogous.

99
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,660
And so you can see very simply
that assets-- I'll write this

100
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,770
down, you're getting a little
bit of a introduction to

101
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,850
accounting right here-- but
assets are going to always be

102
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,050
equal to liabilities
plus equity.

103
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,310
Because essentially, or you can
view it this way, if you

104
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,220
subtract liabilities from
both sides, assets minus

105
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,250
liabilities is equal
to equity.

106
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,280
This might be a little
bit more intuitive.

107
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,880
What we have leftover is
always what we own

108
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,950
minus what we owe.

109
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,290
That is what the owners have.

110
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,100
Now, when we say that I'm part
owner of our company, that

111
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,370
means that I have a piece
of this pie right here.

112
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,860
This is what I am a part
owner of, the equity.

113
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,180
So for example, if there are
two million shares-- so

114
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:29,650
Company x, let's say they have
two million shares, and let's

115
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,790
say that the equity is really
worth $20 million.

116
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,160
How much is each share
worth, if we believe

117
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,350
all of these numbers?

118
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:46,590
Well, we have $20 million of
equity, divided by two million

119
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:59,370
shares which gets us $10
of equity per share.

120
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,920
So if we believe all of these
numbers, and we know that

121
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,750
Company x has two million
shares, then we would say that

122
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,290
each share is worth $10.

123
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,620
And if we like these numbers,
and if someone is willing to

124
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,200
sell us a share for less than
that, we would buy it.

125
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,010
If someone was willing to pay
more than that, maybe

126
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,960
we would sell it.

127
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,530
And just to make all of this
a little bit more tangible,

128
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,520
let's look at an actual example
of a company, to show

129
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,460
you that I'm not making
all of this stuff up.

130
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,080
I got this off of your
traditional financial sources.

131
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,820
This is actually from
the filings of

132
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,440
this unnamed company.

133
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
And you'll get extra bonus
points if you figure out what

134
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,170
this company is.

135
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,910
And this is their actual
stock trading activity.

136
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,400
And I just want to draw the same
diagram that I drew up

137
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,810
here on this company, so you
can kind of see that this

138
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,320
actually happens in
the real world.

139
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,160
So first let's draw
their assets.

140
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,390
Let's say this is Company x.

141
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,780
And let's say these are its
assets right there.

142
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,650
Let's go to its balance
sheet, this is

143
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,970
actually what they reported.

144
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:03,480
This is June 30, so-- well we
want to take the more recent

145
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,590
date, this is-- they're just
trying to compare to what they

146
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,120
had before-- and let's
look at these.

147
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,200
This is some time ago, but
it doesn't matter.

148
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,990
We're learning.

149
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,980
We're not trying to decide
whether we want to invest in

150
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,680
this right now.

151
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,580
This is a very old financial
statement.

152
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,660
But let's just look at
what they're saying.

153
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,440
So they have our total assets
here. $30 million-- I'll just

154
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,120
do in round numbers-- $30
million right there.

155
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,290
   

156
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,610
You might be curious about hey,
what's all this current

157
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,780
asset business?

158
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,040
Those are things that are either
cash or that can be

159
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,170
turned into cash within
the next year.

160
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,540
So, for example, accounts
receivable.

161
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,790
That's money that other maybe
vendors owe them that they're

162
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,940
going to pay very soon.

163
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,590
Inventories, these are things
that they have, maybe in the

164
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,100
warehouse, that they
can sell and turn

165
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,340
into cash very quickly.

166
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,780
Other current assets.

167
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,290
Maybe that's stock or some other
type of investment that

168
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,990
they could sell and
turn into cash.

169
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,980
So they have 18 million
of current assets.

170
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,580
That's things that they can turn
into cash very easily and

171
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,630
very quickly, definitely
within the next year.

172
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,890
And then you have some property,
plant and equipment.

173
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,480
This is kind of that land and
buildings and machinery that I

174
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,960
talked about.

175
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,620
And then, who knows what
these other assets are.

176
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,520
Maybe those are trademarks
or patents or, who

177
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,410
knows what they are.

178
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,580
But all in all, they have
$30 million of assets.

179
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,150
Now let's go to the
liabilities.

180
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,890
So they have some current
liabilities, $16 million.

181
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,780
Current liabilities, just
so you know, those are

182
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,540
liabilities-- these are things
that they have to pay in cash

183
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,450
within the next year.

184
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,640
It could be debt, it could be
payables they have to pay some

185
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,299
other vendors.

186
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,260
Who knows what it is.

187
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,909
But you can kind of view it
as debt on some level.

188
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,970
Maybe debt that you have to
pay in the next year.

189
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,830
And then you have long term
debt of $5.5 million.

190
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,620
If you add these two up you get
pretty close to about $22

191
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,890
million, so just for simplicity
I'll put it over

192
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,340
here as $22 million.

193
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,590
So this company has $22 million
in liabilities.

194
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:04,790
   

195
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,000
These are their assets,
just to get all

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,050
the labelling right.

197
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,280
So what's left for equity?

198
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,160
Well just on this simple diagram
we have $8 million

199
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,920
left for equity.

200
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,250
And actually, they did the
calculation here for us.

201
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,280
The exact number is $8.39 or
$8.4 million in equity.

202
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,270
But this is a nice round number
for us to show it.

203
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,970
So this is real world stuff
that we're dealing with.

204
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,930
And if you wanted to know,
kind of, if you

205
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,180
believe these numbers.

206
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,070
If you believe that this
company's assets really are

207
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,140
worth $30 million, what
should you pay for it?

208
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,410
Well, then you're going
to divide by the

209
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,030
total number of shares.

210
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,230
And you'll see this in some
financial statements, and I

211
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,810
won't go into the details of the
difference between basic

212
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,490
and diluted, but the numbers
are very, very close.

213
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,060
So we don't have to worry
about it too much.

214
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,020
But let's just say that this
company has 2.7-- looks like

215
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,990
2.78 million shares.

216
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,140
So if the book value is 8.396--
I mean I wrote eight

217
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,670
here-- how much should each of
these shares-- how much should

218
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,620
each of these-- and when I say
book value, I mean these are

219
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,770
their books-- according to their
books, the equity is

220
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,730
worth 8.4 million.

221
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,840
So if we if we really believe
that the equity is worth 8.4

222
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,410
million, how much should
each share be worth?

223
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:28,870
Well, we'll just divide 8.4
million-- this is actually

224
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,240
8.4, I wrote eight there for
simplicity-- divided by the

225
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,360
number shares, 2.78 million.

226
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,570
So that's a million and
that's a million.

227
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,260
And I'll get a calculator out
for this one right here.

228
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:52,520
So, let's see, you're doing 8.4
million divided by 2.78

229
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,020
million shares.

230
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,010
So if we believe these numbers,
if we believe the

231
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,180
books, the book value
of the shares is

232
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,850
about $3.02 per share.

233
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:11,920
So this is $3.02 per share--
book value per share.

234
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,390
That's what we should be willing
to pay for this, or we

235
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,760
think a fair price per share of
this company is, if we take

236
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,730
these assets are really
worth $30 million.

237
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,660
Now, what are people actually
paying for these shares?

238
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,720
Well, we look at this
information right here.

239
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,620
And we see that the last trade
here was for $2.58.

240
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,590
So people are paying a discount
to the number we just

241
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,090
calculated.

242
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,840
So the only reason why people
are paying less than that, or

243
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,870
someone's willing to sell for
less than $3.00 is that

244
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,880
someone out there, especially
the person selling, thinks

245
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,780
that this company really-- the
assets of this company really

246
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,340
aren't worth $30 million.

247
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,740
He or she thinks that the assets
of this company are

248
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,180
worth less than $30 million.

249
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,570
And maybe they think that the
company's prospects aren't as

250
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,020
good, their product
isn't good-- the

251
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,020
sales are going down.

252
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,830
Who knows, maybe the person
buying it, maybe they think it

253
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,690
is worth $3.00 a share and
that's why they're willing to

254
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,020
pay $2.58 for it, because they
think it's going to go up.

255
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,070
And just so that we get some of
the other details that we

256
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,420
see here, this bid right here,
this is what someone has

257
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,760
explicitly said that they are
willing to pay for a share.

258
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,340
The ask is what someone has
explicitly said they're

259
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,810
willing to sell a share for.

260
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,510
This 52 week range is the
range of prices that the

261
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,590
shares have sold.

262
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,010
So, in the past year, these
shares sold for as low as a

263
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,370
$1.20, and that was actually a
great deal because then they

264
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,940
went up-- even now where they're
selling at $2.58.

265
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,020
The average volume right here,
this is the number of shares

266
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,600
sold per day-- exchanged
per day.

267
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,560
The market cap, right here,
you've probably heard that

268
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,600
word before.

269
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,510
That's essentially the market's
sense of what this

270
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,270
number really is.

271
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,910
We're saying that the books of
this company are saying this

272
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,620
company's worth $8 million.

273
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,910
But the market cap is saying
what the equity of the company

274
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,840
is worth in the market's mind.

275
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:09,110
And to get that number, they're
taking the $2.58 times

276
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,980
the number of shares-- times
the 2.78 million shares.

277
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:23,540
If we do that, we're going to
get 2.58 times 2.78 is equal

278
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,850
to, exactly-- well it's a little
different than what

279
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,230
they had, maybe it's little
round off error, but roughly

280
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,870
$7 million in market cap.

281
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,660
So like I said before, the
market is not paying $3.00,

282
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,560
it's paying $2.58.

283
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,220
And so the market is saying that
the equity, this piece

284
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,880
right here, is closer to seven
million, even though the books

285
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,550
are saying that this
number right here

286
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,380
is above eight million.

287
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,160
Well anyway, hopefully that was
a little bit useful and

288
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,410
gives you a little bit of a
sense of what it actually

289
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,310
means to buy shares
in a company.

290
00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:04,969
