00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:07,866
We’re here in MoMA storage with Pablo Picasso’s

2
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:11,479
“Glass, Guitar, and Bottle” of 1913.

3
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:14,403
He, along with other Cubist painters –

4
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:17,156
notably Georges Braque and Juan Gris –

5
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:20,630
had begun to introduce non-art materials

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,966
into their fine-art pictures –

7
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:27,716
things like wallpaper or newspaper –

8
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:30,236
a few snippets of which you see here.

9
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:33,963
By contrast, what Picasso sets the task of doing

10
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:37,049
is trying to build a collage of paint.

11
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,131
The result is really one of Picasso’s most

12
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:43,323
complex paintings of the Cubist period, in terms of

13
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:46,713
its facture and the variety of its surface effects.

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,631
So he used all of these different tools

15
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,070
and devices to manipulate his paint.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,575
Stencils, bits of cardboard to push up

17
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:57,565
against the edges of paintings.

18
00:00:57,565 --> 00:01:00,882
These very sharp, distinct lines.

19
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:02,712
Sometimes he would use,

20
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,207
with a stencil that was cut,

21
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:06,357
the jagged edges of his scissors, (Right?)

22
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,771
would be translated over into the paint.

23
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:11,792
Our conservators suspect that in some areas

24
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:15,492
creating skins of paint – skins of white lead paint –

25
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,408
and then literally applying those in these

26
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:21,044
shaped contours to the surface of this work –

27
00:01:21,044 --> 00:01:23,396
so, actually, taking the material of paint

28
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:26,273
and making it a collage element literally. [LAUGHTER.]

29
00:01:26,273 --> 00:01:27,572
The Paris Surrealists,

30
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:30,061
some people like Louis Aragon and André Breton,

31
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:34,062
always insisted, in fact, that paste and paper

32
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:37,300
were not essential to the making of collage.

33
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,883
They really described collage as an operation

34
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:42,154
that set out to produce a work of art,

35
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:44,041
that wasn't a seamless unity –

36
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,570
that wasn't a coherent whole.

37
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,156
That made you so forcefully cognizant

38
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:49,812
of the constructed nature.

39
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:51,490
Picasso’s always engaged with this game

40
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,489
of the true and the false, the vrai and the faux,

41
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,228
reality and illusion.

42
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:59,564
And this picture sort of ups the ante of that game

43
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:03,739
in this way that is absolutely remarkable.

44
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:07,739
