1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420
   

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,500
Let's do a couple of word
problems. This tells us that

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,770
Nadia's at home and Peter is
at school, which is 6 miles

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,660
away from home.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,820
So let me draw a little
diagram here.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,230
So Nadia is there.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,950
Peter is over there, and
they're 6 miles apart.

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,470
So this is the distance between
home and school.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,115
That is 6 miles.

10
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:25,630
   

11
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,440
They start traveling to each
other at the same time.

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,360
So they both leave at the
same time, traveling

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,680
towards each other.

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,890
Nadia is walking at 3 and
1/2 miles per hour.

15
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:44,460
So she's travelling at
3 and 1/2 miles per

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,990
hour in that direction.

17
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,150
And Peter is skateboarding
at 6 miles per

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,060
hour in that direction.

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,160
So Peter is going in that
direction at 6 miles per hour.

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,410
When will they meet and
how far from home is

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,980
their meeting place?

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,200
So let's say that their meeting
place is right-- I

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,390
don't know.

24
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,120
It's going to be closer to
home, because this guy is

25
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,000
going faster.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,630
Peter is going faster.

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,020
So let's say, let x be
equal to the distance

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,270
from home they meet.

29
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:19,340
   

30
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,120
So this distance right here
is going to be x.

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,750
And then what's this distance
going to be?

32
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,300
Well, if that's x, and this
whole thing is 6 miles, then

33
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,460
this distance right there is
going to be 6 minus x.

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,760
So Nadia will travel x
miles and Peter will

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,400
travel 6 minus x miles.

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,340
And they're going to travel
the same amount of time.

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,730
Remember, they both leave at
time 0, and after time t, they

38
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,050
will both meet right there.

39
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,050
So they're both going to take
the same amount of time.

40
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,180
So Nadia's equation, if we just
remember that distance is

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,510
equal to rate times time, we
could use that for both of

42
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,950
them, in Nadia's case, the
distance she travels is x.

43
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,280
x is going to be equal to her
rate, which is 3.5 miles per

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,410
hour, times t, which is the
time that she travels.

45
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,660
And then Peter's equation is
going to be his distance.

46
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,880
Well, he travels 6 minus x
miles, so it's 6 minus x is

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,190
going to be equal to his rate,
which is 6 miles per hour

48
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,600
times the time he travels.

49
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,960
Well, he also travels
t hours, so times t.

50
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,660
So we have two equations
and two unknowns, so we

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,420
can solve for them.

52
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,840
We've already solved
for x here.

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,660
So let's substitute this
for x right there.

54
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,510
So we can rewrite this equation
as 6 minus, but

55
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:55,390
instead of an x, we can put
3.5t, 6 minus 3.5t, because we

56
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:02,160
know that x is equal to
3.5t, is equal to 6t.

57
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,270
And then let's see, if we add
3.5t to both sides of this

58
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:17,130
equation, we get 6 is equal to
3.5t plus 6t is 9.5t, or if we

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:27,880
divide both sides by 9.5, you
get t is equal to 6 over 9.5

60
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,110
hours, which is a bit
of a bizarre number.

61
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,520
But 9.5, we can rewrite that.

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,670
That is the same thing as 6
over-- see, 9.5, that's the

63
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,020
same thing as 19/2, right?

64
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,530
19/2, you divide that and
you would get 9.5.

65
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,620
So this is equal to
6 times 2 over 19.

66
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,860
So this is equal to
12/19 of an hour.

67
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,290
That's how long it'll
take them to meet.

68
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,210
And then if you ask the question
how far from home

69
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,170
will they meet?

70
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,310
If you want to figure out the
x value, x is going to be

71
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:09,390
equal to 3.5-- actually, instead
of writing 3.5, I can

72
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:16,779
write 3.5 as 7/2; that's the
same thing as 3.5-- times our

73
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,672
time, times 12/19.

74
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:25,740
So you divide the numerator and
the denominator by 2, and

75
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:33,360
we get 7 times 6 is
42 over 19 miles.

76
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,230
And this right here,
that is in hours.

77
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,110
So in 12/19 of an hour-- it's
a weird fraction-- they will

78
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,560
meet exactly 42/19
miles from home.

79
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,580
So it's a little over
2 miles from home.

80
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,150
Next problem.

81
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,760
Peter bought several notebooks
at Staples for $2.25.

82
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,650
And he bought a few
more notebooks at

83
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,650
Rite Aid for $2 each.

84
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,900
He spent the same amount of
money in both places and he

85
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,620
bought 17 notebooks in total.

86
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,530
How many notebooks did
he buy in each store?

87
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,320
So let's define some
variables.

88
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:22,120
Let's let S equal number
bought at Staples.

89
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,990
And then we could say that R is
equal to the number bought

90
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,910
at Rite Aid.

91
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,870
So what do we know?

92
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,430
   

93
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,630
So he bought a total
of 17 notebooks.

94
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,800
Let me do that in a
different color.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,550
He bought a total
of 17 notebooks.

96
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,330
So that tells us that S
plus R is equal to 17.

97
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,600
And we also know that he spent
the same amount of money in

98
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,320
both places.

99
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,110
So how much did he spend
at Rite Aid?

100
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,990
Let me do this in orange.

101
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,190
Spent the same amount of
money in both places.

102
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,210
So at Staples, how much
did he spend?

103
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:21,940
He bought S notebooks for $2.25
each, so 2.25S, that's

104
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,345
how much he spent at Staples.

105
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:29,290
   

106
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,030
That's going to be equal
to the amount he

107
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,930
spent at Rite Aid.

108
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,340
He spent $2 per notebook
at Rite Aid.

109
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,540
   

110
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,310
So $2 times the number of
notebooks from Rite Aid, so

111
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,680
this is spent at Rite Aid.

112
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,890
So once again, two equations
with two unknowns.

113
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,710
We can do a little bit of
substitution maybe.

114
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,900
So what's the best way
to substitute here?

115
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,870
Well, let's divide both
sides of this

116
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,070
equation by 2 right here.

117
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,350
So you have-- I'm going to
rewrite 2.2-- well, I'll just

118
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,950
do it like this.

119
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,590
So you have R.

120
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,570
If you divide both sides of this
by 2, you have 2.25 over

121
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,360
2S is equal to R, right?

122
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,750
I just divided both sides
of this by 2.

123
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:27,080
So if you take this value and
you substitute it in for R

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:34,540
right there, this equation
becomes S plus-- instead of an

125
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:44,930
R we have 2.25 over
2S is equal to 17.

126
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,610
And let's just simplify.

127
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,200
So this is 1-- we could view
this as 2 over 2S, right?

128
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
The coefficient there
is just 1.

129
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,310
So we can view this as we have
a common denominator.

130
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:02,550
This is the same thing is 4.25
over 2S is equal to 17.

131
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,710
I'm avoiding doing any
hard math just yet.

132
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,280
Let me multiply both sides
by the inverse.

133
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,390
2/4.25.

134
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,490
It's a little bizarre to have
an expression with both a

135
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,045
fraction and a decimal,
but it's not illegal.

136
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:21,680
Let's multiply both
times 2/4.25.

137
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,720
These cancel out, and so you get
S is equal to 17 times 2

138
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,360
is 34 over 4.25.

139
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,850
And actually, I can
eyeball that.

140
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:40,169
That looks like that should
be equal to 8, right?

141
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:48,300
4.25 is 4 and 1/4, which is the
same thing as 17/4 over 4.

142
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,530
So this is the same thing as
34 over 17/4, which is the

143
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:58,750
same thing as 34 times 4/17.

144
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,690
Put a 1 there, divide by 17, you
get a 2, divide by 17, you

145
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,210
get a 1, 2 times 4 is 8.

146
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,530
So he bought 8 notebooks at
Staples, this is 8, and then

147
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,940
at Rite Aid, he bought-- well,
8 plus R is equal to 17.

148
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,820
Subtract 8 from both sides.

149
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,920
He must have bought 9 notebooks
at Rite Aid.

150
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,540
Let's do one more.

151
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,400
This one is especially
fun-looking.

152
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,980
Peter is outside, looking
at the pigs and

153
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,430
chickens in the yard.

154
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,310
Nadia is indoors and cannot
see the animals.

155
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,590
Peter gives her a puzzle.

156
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,200
He tells her that he counts 13
heads and 36 feet and asks her

157
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,540
how many pigs and how many
chickens are in the yard.

158
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,520
So let's once again define
our variables.

159
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,160
P is equal to the
number of pigs.

160
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,510
And let C is equal to the
number of chickens.

161
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,550
So the number of heads will
essentially be the number of

162
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,660
pigs and chickens, assuming
they each have one head.

163
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,920
So the number of pigs plus the
number of chickens will be

164
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,190
equal to the number of heads,
so that is right here.

165
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,490
That is 13 heads.

166
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,160
And then 4 times the number
of pigs, right?

167
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,460
Each pig has 4 legs, so 4 times
the number of pigs plus

168
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,410
2 times the number of chickens,
assuming we're

169
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,130
dealing with two-legged
chickens, is going to be equal

170
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:30,100
to the number of feet,
is equal to 36.

171
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,400
So once again, we have two
equations with two unknowns.

172
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,750
Instead of solving it with
substitution, I'm going to do

173
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,230
it by adding and subtracting
the two equations.

174
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,990
So what we can do, this
equation, we can

175
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,740
multiply it times 2.

176
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,240
And when I say multiply it times
2, we have to multiply

177
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,720
the entire equation times 2.

178
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,970
And so it's still true.

179
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,590
So we multiply the entire
equation times 2.

180
00:10:53,590 --> 00:11:00,150
This becomes 2P plus
2C is equal to 26.

181
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,250
And now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to subtract this

182
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,790
equation from that equation,
which you can do.

183
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,660
Because that is equal to that,
that is equal to that, and so

184
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,270
we're not doing anything that
violates the laws of algebra.

185
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,720
So if you subtract the bottom
equation from the top

186
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,840
equation, or I could just put
a negative sign everywhere

187
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,760
here, just so you know
we're subtracting,

188
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,650
4P minus 2P is 2P.

189
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,530
2C minus 2C is 0.

190
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,440
That's why I did this, so that
these would cancel out.

191
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,750
And then 36 minus 26
is equal to 10.

192
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,670
So 2P is equal to 10.

193
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,830
Divide both sides by 2.

194
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,910
We have 5 pigs.

195
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,440
And then 5 plus the number of
chickens is equal to 13, so we

196
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,630
must have-- subtract 5 from
both sides-- 8 chickens.

197
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,420
Now if this confuses you, you
might want to try it with

198
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,750
substitution, but I have many
videos on solving systems of

199
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,430
equations where I go a little
bit slower and explain a

200
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,710
little bit more of
the logic of it.

201
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,280
So whatever floats your boat.

202
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,500
But either way, Nadia should
hopefully guess or hopefully

203
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,150
solve for 5 pigs
and 8 chickens.

204
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,160
And it should work out, right?

205
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,280
You have 13 animals.

206
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,620
You have 13 heads.

207
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:15,480
And if you multiply 5 times 4,
that's 20 pig feet plus 16

208
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,190
chicken feet.

209
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,400
20 plus 16 is 36 total feet.

210
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,866
