1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,839
So say you're me and you're in math class

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,246
and you're trying to ignore the teacher and

3
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:05,647
doodle fibbonachi spirals while simultaneously trying to

4
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:06,981
fend off the local greenery,

5
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:08,174
only if you become interested in

6
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,681
something the teacher said by accident.

7
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:11,922
And so you draw too many squares to start with.

8
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:13,743
So you cross them out, but you crossed out too many,

9
00:00:13,743 --> 00:00:15,411
and then the teacher gets back on track and

10
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:16,600
the moment is over, so...

11
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,518
Oh well, might as well try to do the spiral from here.

12
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:21,062
So you make a 3 by 3 square,

13
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,490
and here's a 4 by 4

14
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,323
and then 7 and then 11...

15
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:26,541
This works, as in you got a spiral of squares,

16
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,750
so you write down the numbers.

17
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,969
1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18.

18
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:31,833
is kind of like the Fibonacci series,

19
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,631
because 1 + 3 is 4

20
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,494
3 + 4 is 7 and so on

21
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,047
Or maybe you start as 2 + 1

22
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:38,513
or -1 + 2

23
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:40,495
Either way is a perfectly good series,

24
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:42,395
and it's got another similarity

25
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:44,079
with the Fibonacci series.

26
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,646
The ratios of consecutive numbers also approach phi.

27
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:50,365
Ok, so a lot of plants have Fibonacci numbers of spirals,

28
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:51,839
but to understand how they do it

29
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:53,506
we can learn from the exceptions.

30
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:55,993
This pinecone that has 7 spirals one way

31
00:00:55,993 --> 00:00:58,403
and 11 the other, might be showing Lucas numbers.

32
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:00,170
And since Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers

33
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,233
are related, maybe that explains it.

34
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:04,771
One theory was that plants get Fibonacci numbers

35
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:06,486
by always growing new parts

36
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:08,510
a phi-th of a circle all around.

37
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,483
What angle will give Lucas numbers?

38
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:12,788
In this pinecone, each new pinecony thing

39
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:15,040
is about a 100 degrees around from the last.

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,344
We're going to need a Lucas angle-a-tron.

41
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,452
It's easy to get a 90 degree angle-a-tron,

42
00:01:19,452 --> 00:01:21,220
and if I take a third of a third of that,

43
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,978
that's a ninth of 90 which is another 10 degrees.

44
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:24,791
There.

45
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,599
Now you can use it to get spiral patterns

46
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,626
like what you see on a Lucas number plants.

47
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:30,721
It's an easy way to grow Lucas spirals

48
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:32,663
if plants have an internal angle-a-tron.

49
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:35,545
Thing is, a hundred is pretty far from 137.5.

50
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,780
If plants were somehow meassuring angles,

51
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,548
you'd think the anomalous ones

52
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:42,289
would show angles close to a phi-th of a circle,

53
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:44,073
not jump all the way to 100.

54
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:46,015
Maybe I believe different species

55
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,209
use different angles,

56
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,872
but two pinecones from the same tree,

57
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:50,811
two spirals on the same cauliflower?

58
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,461
And that's not the only exception.

59
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:54,759
A lot of plants don't grow spirally at all.

60
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,366
Like this thing with leaves growing opposite from each other.

61
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,132
And some plants have alternating leaves,

62
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:00,641
180 degrees from each other,

63
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:03,326
which is far from both phi and Lucas angles.

64
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:05,021
And you could say that these don't count,

65
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:07,168
because they have fundamentally different growth pattern

66
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,912
and they are different in class of plant or something.

67
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:10,910
But wouldn't it be even better if there were

68
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,225
one simple reason for all of these things?

69
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:14,952
These variations are good clue that

70
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:16,816
maybe these plants get this angle

71
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:19,518
and Fibonacci number as a consequence of

72
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:21,659
some other process and not just because

73
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:23,603
it mathematically optimises sunlight exposure.

74
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:25,040
If this sun is right over head

75
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,376
which pretty much never is and

76
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,632
if the plants are perfectly facing straight up which they aren't.

77
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:29,815
So how do they do it?

78
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,235
Well you could try observing them,

79
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,574
that would be like science.

80
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:35,356
If you zoom in on the tip of a plant, the growing part,

81
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,916
there's this part called the meristem.

82
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,965
That's where new plant bits form.

83
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:40,731
The biggest plant bits were

84
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:42,708
the first to form of the meristem,

85
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,590
and the little ones around the center are newer.

86
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,839
As the plant grows

87
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:48,142
they get pushed away from the meristem

88
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:49,692
but they all started there.

89
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:51,357
The important part is that

90
00:02:51,357 --> 00:02:52,789
the science observer would see

91
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,354
the plant bits pushing away

92
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:55,440
not just from the meristem

93
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,723
but from each other.

94
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,388
A couple physicists want to try this thing

95
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,608
where they drop drops of a magnetized liquid

96
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,242
in a dish of oil.

97
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:04,057
The drops repelled each other

98
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:05,249
kind of like plant bits do and

99
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:06,866
were attracted to the edge of the dish

100
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,955
just like a plant bits move away from the center.

101
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,525
The first couple drops would head

102
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:11,979
in opposite direction from each other,

103
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,786
but then the third was repelled by both,

104
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:17,722
but pushed farther by the more recent and closer drop.

105
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:20,639
It and each new drop would set off at a phi angle

106
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,554
relative to the drop before

107
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:25,618
and the drops ended up forming Fibonacci number spirals.

108
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:27,123
So all the plant would need to do

109
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,367
to get Fibonacci number spirals, is

110
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:30,250
to figure out how to make the plant bits repel each other.

111
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,589
We don't know all the details.

112
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:32,647
But here is what we do know.

113
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,842
There is the hormone that tells plant bits to grow.

114
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:37,332
A plant bit might use up the hormone around it.

115
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:38,566
But there is more further away,

116
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:39,677
so it will grow in that direction.

117
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,765
That makes plant bits move out from the meristem

118
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:43,199
after they form.

119
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,752
Meanwhile the meristem keeps forming new plant bits

120
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:48,504
and they're gonna grow in places that aren't too crowded

121
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:50,672
because that's where there's the most growth hormone.

122
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:52,700
This leaves them to move further out

123
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,575
into the space left by the other outward moving plant bits.

124
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,560
And once everything get locked into a pattern

125
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,571
it's hard to get out of it,

126
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,702
because there's no way for this plant bit

127
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:02,798
to wander off unless there were empty space

128
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:05,480
with a trail of plant hormone to lead it out of its spot,

129
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,233
but if there were

130
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:08,243
all the nearer plant bits would use up the hormone

131
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:09,830
in grow to fill out in space.

132
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,165
Mathematicians and programmers

133
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:12,493
was made their own simulations

134
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:13,709
and found the same thing.

135
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:14,901
The best way to fit new things in

136
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,298
with the most space

137
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,398
has some pop-up at that angle,

138
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:19,053
not because plant knows about the angle,

139
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:20,184
but because that's where

140
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:21,431
the most hormone has build up.

141
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,808
Once it gets started, it's the self-perpetuating cycle.

142
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:25,681
All that these flower bits are doing

143
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:27,423
is growing where there is most room for them.

144
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:29,247
The rest happens auto-math-ically.

145
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:31,248
It's not weird that all these plants

146
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:32,721
show Fibonacci numbers,

147
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:34,318
it would be weird if they didn't.

148
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:36,266
It had to be this way.

149
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:38,130
The best thing about that theory

150
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,842
is that it explains why Lucas pinecones would happen.

151
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:43,197
If something goes a bit differently in the very beginning

152
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:46,337
the meristem will settle into a different but stable pattern

153
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,748
of where there's the most room to add new plant bits.

154
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,430
That is 100 degrees away.

155
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,420
It even explains alternating leaf patterns.

156
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,062
If the leaves are far enough apart,

157
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:55,998
relative to how much growth hormone they like,

158
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:57,740
that these leaves don't have

159
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,311
any repelling force with each other,

160
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:01,274
and all these leaves care about is

161
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:04,061
being farthest away from the two above and below it,

162
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:06,030
which makes 180 degrees optimal.

163
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,400
And when leaves grow in pairs

164
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,098
that are opposite each other

165
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:10,846
the answer where there's most room

166
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,255
for both of those leaves

167
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:14,327
is at 90 degrees from the one below it.

168
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:15,604
And if you look hard

169
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:17,302
you can discover even more unusual patterns.

170
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:19,330
The dots on the neck of this whatever it is

171
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,405
come in spirals of 14 and 22

172
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,178
which may be as like doubled a Lucas numbers,

173
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:24,662
and this pinecone has 6 and 10 -

174
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:25,961
doubled Fibonacci numbers.

175
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:28,194
So how is the pineapple like a pinecone,

176
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,179
what do daisies and brussels

177
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:31,511
perhaps have in common?

178
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:34,466
Is not the numbers they show, it's how they grow.

179
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:36,744
This pattern is not just useful, not just beautiful.

180
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:38,306
It's inevitable.

181
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:41,576
This is why science and mathematics are still much fun.

182
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:44,430
You discover things that seem impossible to be true

183
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,579
and then get to figure out

184
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,596
why it's impossible for them not to be.

185
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,843
To get this far in our understanding of these things

186
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:52,138
it took the combined effort of mathematicians,

187
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:53,720
physicists, botanists and biochemists,

188
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,133
and we've certainly learned a lot,

189
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,663
but there's much more to be discovered.

190
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,568
May be you should keep doodling in math class?

191
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:07,242
You can help figure it out.
