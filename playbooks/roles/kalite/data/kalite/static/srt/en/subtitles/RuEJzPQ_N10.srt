1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:06,669
Part B. For x is not equal to zero, express f prime of x as a piecewise-defined function.

2
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:11,148
Find the value of x for which f prime of x is equal to negative 3.

3
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:16,434
So the first thing you might be wondering is why did we even have to take out x is equal to zero from the...

4
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,200
Or why, Why is the dervative not going to be defined there.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,748
And that's just because you're going to see the derivative is going to be something different when we approach

6
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:27,154
x is equal to zero from the left verses when we approach x is equal to zero from the right.

7
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:29,069
And that's why they just took it out of there for us.

8
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:32,846
But let's just figure out what that derivative is for all of the other values for x.

9
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:36,375
So f prime of x is equal to...

10
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:41,767
So for x is less than zero, we're going to take the derivative of this first case...

11
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:46,126
So the derivative of one is just zero, the derivative of negative 2 sine of x...

12
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:50,831
Well the derivative of sine of x is just cosine of x. So it's going to be negative 2 cosine of x.

13
00:00:50,831 --> 00:01:00,282
Negative 2 cosine of x, for, for x is less than zero. And then for x is greater than zero...

14
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:02,364
I'll do this in another color, I'll do it in orange...

15
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:06,864
We have this case right over here and we'll just do the chain rule.

16
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:13,225
Derivative of negative 4 x with respect to x is negative 4.

17
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:18,136
And the derivative of e to the negative 4 x with respect to e... wait wait,...

18
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:26,234
The derivative of e to the negative 4 x with respect to negative 4 x is just e to the negative 4 x.... e to the negative 4 x.

19
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:31,400
Sometimes you can say this is the derivative of the inside times the derivative of the outside with respect to the inside.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:40,215
So either way, it's negative 4 e to the negative 4 x for x is greater than zero.

21
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:46,990
So we did the first part: we expressed f prime of x as a piecewise-defined function. It's not... we didn't define the derivative...

22
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,298
Actually I forgot a parenthesis here. We didn't derive... we didn't define the derivative when x is equal to zero...

23
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:56,477
Cause it's actually not going to be defined there. Now let's do the second part...

24
00:01:56,477 --> 00:02:01,513
Find the value of x for which f prime of x is equal to negative 3.

25
00:02:01,513 --> 00:02:08,462
And so, if this wasn't piecewise-defined, you'd just, you'd just very simply just say, oh look, f prime of x is equal to negative 3...

26
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,425
You would take whatever f prime of x is equal to and you would do some algebra to solve for it.

27
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:19,400
But here you're like, which case do I use? I don't know if the x that gets us to negative 3 is going to be less than 0 or I don't know if it's going to be greater than 0.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,652
So I don't know which case to use. And one thing that they realize is to... is to look at these functions a little bit...

29
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:29,015
...and realize that cosine of x is a bounded function.

30
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:40,267
Cosine of x can only go between positive 1 and negative 1. So negative 2 cosine of x can only go between positive 2 and negative 2.

31
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:45,036
So this can only go between positive 2 and negative 2, so it can never get to negative 3.

32
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:51,933
So if anything is ever going to get to negative 3, it's going to be this part of the derivative or this part of the derivative definition.

33
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:54,646
So it's going to have to be this thing right over here.

34
00:02:54,646 --> 00:03:00,923
And hopefully there's some values of x greater than zero where this thing right over here is equal to negative 3.

35
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:08,898
So let's try it out. Negative four e to the negative 4 x needs to be equal to negative 3.

36
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:18,348
We can divide both sides by negative 4, we get e to the negative 4 x is equal to negative 3/4ths divided by negative 4 is 3/4ths.

37
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:29,185
We can take the natural log of both sides and we will get negative 4 x is equal to the natural log of 3/4ths... natural log of 3/4ths.

38
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:35,405
And just to be clear what I did here, I mean you literally could put the natural log here, natural log there, and...

39
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:40,215
you could put the natural log there as well to see that step. The natural... this is saying what power,

40
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:45,333
What power do I have to raise e to, to get e to the negative 4 x. Well obviously I just need to raise

41
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:51,379
e to the just... the negative 4 x power over there. So this, this power is negative 4 x.

42
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:58,329
And then we just took the natural log of the right hand side as well. And then to solve for x you can divide both sides by negative 4.

43
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:04,677
So you get x is equal to... or we... or we could say... we could multiple both sides by negative 1/4th... either way....

44
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:11,887
Negative one fourth natural log of 3/4ths. And what we need to do is verify that this x...

45
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:19,400
So we used this case right over here. We used that case. But we have to make sure that this x, that this, that we can use this case...

46
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,267
That this x is greater than zero, and we might be tempted right when we look at this, say wait wait...,

47
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:28,867
This looks like a negative number, But we have to remind ourselves that the natural log of 3/4ths,

48
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:35,067
Since 3/4ths is less than e, the natural log of 3/4ths is going to be a negative number.

49
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:43,600
It's going to be e to some negative exponent. So since this is negative, and ... and this part right over here is negative,

50
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,985
So that is also negative, you have a negative times a negative so this right over here is goign to be positive.

51
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:56,667
So this is a positive value right over here, so you would use, you would use, you would use

52
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:02,898
this case right over here so that's our answer: x is equal to negative 1/4th natural log of 3/4ths.

53
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:15,236
Or the derivative we could write f prime of -1/4 times the natural log of 3/4ths is equal to... is equal to negative 3. And we're done.
