00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,370
What I want to discuss a little bit in this video

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,703
Is the idea of a random Variable

3
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:11,836
And random variables are first a little bit confusing

4
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:14,714
because we would want to think of them as traditional

5
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:16,570
variables that you are first exposed to in algebra class

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,117
and that's not quite what random variables are

7
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:25,490
Random variables are really ways to map outcomes of random processes to numbers

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,292
So if you have a random process, like you're flipping a coin

9
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:33,851
or you're rolling dice, or you're messuring the rain

10
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,755
than may fall tomorrow, so random process

11
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:45,296
you're really just mapping outcomes of that to numbers

12
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:49,155
you're quantifying the outcomes

13
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:51,622
so what's an example of a random variable

14
00:00:51,622 --> 00:00:53,286
Well let's define one right over here

15
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:59,158
so I'm gonna define random variable capital X and they tend to be denoted by capital letters

16
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:02,954
so random variable capital X, I will define it as

17
00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:04,749
is going to be equal to

18
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:14,643
1 if my fair coin rolls heads

19
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:20,821
and it's going to be equal to 0 if tails

20
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,455
I could have define this any way I wanted to

21
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:26,510
This is actually a fairly typical way of defining a random variable supposed to be a coin flip

22
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,552
but I could have define this is a 100 and I could have define this is 703

23
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:34,614
and this would still be a legitimate random variable

24
00:01:34,614 --> 00:01:38,827
It might not be as pure way of thinking about it

25
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:42,791
as defining 1 is heads and 0 is tails, but that would have been a random variable

26
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:46,618
Notice we have taken this random process - flipping a coin

27
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:49,394
and we mapped the outcomes of that random process and we quatified them

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,221
1 if heads, 0 if tails

29
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:56,521
We can define another random variable

30
00:01:56,521 --> 00:02:01,128
capital Y as equal to

31
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:11,597
let say, the sum of, roll, let say, seven dices

32
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:14,965
we talk about the sum of seven

33
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:18,982
let me write this, the sum of upward faces,

34
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:20,150
after rolling seven dices

35
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:32,031
