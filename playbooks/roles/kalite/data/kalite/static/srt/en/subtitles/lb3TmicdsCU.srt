1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
   

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,250
We're on problem 13.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,140
A company sells boxes of
balloons in which the balloons

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,260
are red, green, or blue.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,030
Luann purchased-- that
doesn't sound like a

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,020
name related to me.

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,090
Luann purchased a box of
balloons in which 1/3

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,340
of them were red.

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,670
   

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,250
If there were 1/2 as many green
balloons in the box as

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,190
red ones-- so green is
equal to 1/2 red.

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,250
Fair enough.

13
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,332
Green is equal to 1/2 red.

14
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,380
There's 1/2 as many green
balloons in the box as red

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:43,350
ones, and 18 balloons were blue,
how many balloons were

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,600
in the box?

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,140
   

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,550
OK, so this is fascinating.

19
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,120
So 1/3 are red.

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,050
And then the green is 1/2 as
many as the red, right?

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,370
So if 1/3 of them are red, how
may are going to be green?

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,270
Well, 1/2 of the 1/3, right?

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,080
So we know that 1/6 are
going to be green.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,330
How did I get 1/6?

25
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,500
   

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,860
Let's say there's
10 red, right?

27
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,950
And 10 is 1/3, then there's
going to be-- let's say

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,280
there's 30 balloons.

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,400
1/3 is red, so then it's 10.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,500
So green's going to be 1/2 of
that, so it'd be 5/30 or 1/6.

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,710
So whatever the number is,
1/3 are red, 1/2 of

32
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,350
that, or 1/6, are green.

33
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,180
And there are 18 blue.

34
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,290
So what can we do now?

35
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,480
Well, let's figure
out what fraction

36
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,020
would have to be blue.

37
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,630
We know that 1/3 are
red 1/6 are green.

38
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,760
What's left over?

39
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,110
So what's 1 minus
1/3 minus 1/6?

40
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,480
This will tell us how many blue,
what fraction of the

41
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,870
balloons have to be blue.

42
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,860
So that equals-- let's make 6
the common denominator, right?

43
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,020
1 is equal to 6/6 minus 1/3.

44
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,180
That's equal to 2/6 minus 1/6.

45
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,170
So that's 6 minus 2 minus 1.

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,130
So that's 3/6 are blue, right?

47
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,010
And I just subtracted the
fraction that are red and I

48
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,240
subtracted the fraction that
are green from the whole.

49
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,020
And so I get 3/6, or
1/2, are blue.

50
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,070
So 1/2 of the balloons in
the container, or in

51
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,430
the box, are blue.

52
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,300
And they want to know how many
balloons are in the box?

53
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,950
Well, there are 18 blue, and
that's 1/2 of all of the

54
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,270
balloons, right?

55
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,520
So 18 is equal to 1/2 of
all of the balloons.

56
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,380
Multiply both sides by 2, you
get 36 is equal to x.

57
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,410
And you know that.

58
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,570
18 is 1/2 of something,
then the total number

59
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,000
of balloons is 36.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,810
That's our answer.

61
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:45,710
Next problem, 14.

62
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:51,460
The three distinct points P,
Q, and R lie on line L, OK?

63
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,080
The four distinct points S, T,
U, V lie on a different line

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
that is parallel to L.

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,080
What is the total number of
different lines that can be

66
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,610
drawn so that each line contains
exactly two of the

67
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,860
seven points.

68
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,500
   

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,060
OK, I see what they're saying.

70
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,330
So let's draw the first
line, P, Q, and R.

71
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,770
   

72
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:21,560
So let me just draw the two
lines first. So the first line

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,150
is line P, Q, and R.

74
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,860
   

75
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,735
And then the second line
is S, T, U, and V.

76
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:38,080
So then we have S,
T, U, and V.

77
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,640
And this line is parallel
to this line, right?

78
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,540
They're parallel, so they're
never going to

79
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,420
intersect each other.

80
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,170
OK, what is the total number of
different lines that can be

81
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,040
drawn so that each line
intersects exactly two of the

82
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,710
seven points?

83
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,300
So you can't even intersect
three of this.

84
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,950
Well, you can, only if you
go through that line.

85
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,860
So what is the total number of
different lines that can be

86
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,520
drawn so that each line contains
exactly two of the

87
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:06,800
seven points?

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,390
Right.

89
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,020
So that's interesting.

90
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,670
So you can't count these
lines, right?

91
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,030
Because these lines
have three.

92
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,590
This line has three of the seven
points, and this line

93
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,040
has four of the seven points.

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,160
So those can't be it, because
it says exactly two.

95
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,000
You can't have even three
of the points.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,920
Sp what are they?

97
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,260
Well, P can go to four
points, right?

98
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,890
I mean, I could just
count them out.

99
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,310
P can go to four points, Q can
be connected with four points,

100
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,360
and R can be connected
with four points, so

101
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,120
it should be 12.

102
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,750
And if you don't know what
I'm saying, let me

103
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,230
just draw it out.

104
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,380
P could be this line,
one, two.

105
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,160
Sorry, that one wasn't
drawn well.

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,400
One, two, three, four.

107
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:03,300
One, two, three, four, and
then one, two, three.

108
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,240
Well, that's kind of a
nice-looking shape there.

109
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,540
So 4 plus 4 plus 4 is 12, so
there's 12 possible lines that

110
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,880
intersect exactly two of
these seven points.

111
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,585
Next problem, problem 15.

112
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,430
I'm still using the line tool.

113
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,260
OK, problem 15.

114
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:31,150
If 2 to the x plus 2 to the x
plus 2 to the x plus-- how

115
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,990
many of these are there?

116
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,090
There's four of them-- plus 2
to the x is equal to 2 the

117
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,400
seventh, what is
the value of x?

118
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,790
So how many of these
are there?

119
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,210
There's one, two, three, four,
which I had to figure out

120
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,720
while I was drawing it.

121
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,430
So there's four.

122
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,990
We're essentially adding to the
x four times, so this is

123
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,520
the same thing as saying 4
times 2 to the x, right?

124
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,540
Because we have 2 to
the x four times:

125
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,720
one, two, three, four.

126
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,450
So this is the same thing as
this: 4 times 2 to the x.

127
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,490
And that equals 2
to the seventh.

128
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,460
What's 4 written as base 2?

129
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,740
That's the same thing
as 2 squared, right?

130
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,063
Whenever you see these problems
and you have two

131
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:13,310
different bases, try to see if
you can convert them all to

132
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,730
the same base.

133
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,810
So that's 2 squared plus-- 2
squared times 2 to the x is

134
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,930
equal to 2 to the seventh.

135
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,380
2 squared times 2 to the x,
that's the same thing as 2 to

136
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,850
the x plus 2.

137
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,230
That equals 2 to the seventh.

138
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,660
So x plus 2 must equal 7.

139
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,600
x plus 2 is equal to 7.

140
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,190
x is equal to 5.

141
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,440
And we are done.

142
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:43,030
Next problem, problem 16.

143
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,560
Each of five people had a blank
card on which they wrote

144
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,280
a positive integer.

145
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,350
If the average of these integers
is 15, what is the

146
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,990
greatest possible integers
that can be

147
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,260
on one of the cards?

148
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,720
This is fascinating.

149
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,930
So essentially, they're saying
you have five positive

150
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,310
integers and their
average is 15.

151
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,450
What is the greatest possible
integer that could be among

152
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,780
these cards?

153
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,500
So think of it this way: the
sum of the five integers is

154
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,760
going to be what?

155
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,340
So let's say it's x1
plus x2 plus x3

156
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,090
plus x4 plus x5, right?

157
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,470
All of them over 5 is
equal to 15, right?

158
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,060
That's what they told us.

159
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,940
The average of the t numbers is
15, so the sum x1 plus x2

160
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,960
plus x3 plus x4 plus x5
is equal to what?

161
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,940
5 times 15, that's 75.

162
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,640
5 times 10 is 50 plus--
OK, that's 75.

163
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,620
So the sum of the integers
are going to be 75.

164
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,510
And so we want to know what the
largest one of these, the

165
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,900
greatest possible
integer here.

166
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,540
So let's just say that
this is what we're

167
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,240
trying to figure out.

168
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,530
Let's try to maximize this
number here, x5.

169
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,670
If we want this number to be
as large as possible, these

170
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,080
numbers have to be as small
as possible, right?

171
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,430
And you could subtract these
numbers from the other side.

172
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:14,770
You could say x5 is equal to 75
minus x1 minus x2 minus x3

173
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,720
minus x4, right?

174
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,970
And we're going to try to
maximize this number.

175
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,880
And then we're going to say
that's going to be the

176
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,160
largest.

177
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,280
So if this is the largest, we
want to subtract as small a

178
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,950
number as possible
here, here, here.

179
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,420
And what are the constraints?

180
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,860
They have to be positive
integers.

181
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,510
So each of these numbers have
to be greater than zero and

182
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,320
have to be integers.

183
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,430
So we want them to be as
small as possible, so

184
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,710
let's make them 1.

185
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,780
So let's say it's 75 minus 1
minus 1 minus 1 minus 1.

186
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,350
That's 75 minus 4,
which equals 71.

187
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,730
So that's the greatest
possible value

188
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,240
of one of the integers.

189
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,320
And I have a minute left and do
problems. No, I'd better do

190
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,350
it in another video.

191
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,300
So I'll see you in
the next video.

192
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,400
