1
00:00:00,856 --> 00:00:03,395
Now that we know a little bit about vectors and scalars ...

2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:07,225
... let's try to apply what we know about them for some pretty common problems ...

3
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:08,908
... you'd have once in physics class ...

4
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:11,200
... but they are also common problems you would see in your everyday life ...

5
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:13,031
... because you're trying to figure out how far you have gone ...

6
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:17,200
... or how fast you are going or how long it might take you to get to some place.

7
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:24,431
So first I have: If Shantanu was able to travel 5 kilometer north in 1 hour ...

8
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:28,292
... in his car, what was his average velocity?

9
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:32,559
So let's just review a little bit about what we know about vectors and scalars.

10
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:37,810
So they are giving us that he was able to travel 5 kilometer to the north

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,390
So they gave us a magnitude ...

12
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:45,677
... that's the 5 kilometer ... that's the size of how far he moved.

13
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,518
And they also gave a direction.

14
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,871
So he moved a distance of 5 km. Distance is the scalar ...

15
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:55,569
... but if they give the direction too you get the displacement.

16
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:57,592
So, this right here is a vector quantity.

17
00:00:57,623 --> 00:01:00,990
He was displaced 5 kilometers to the north.

18
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,625
And he did it in 1 hour in his car.

19
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:06,002
What was his average velocity?

20
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:09,825
So velocity ... and there is many ways you might see it defined.

21
00:01:09,856 --> 00:01:12,369
But velocity - once again - is a vector quantity.

22
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:16,092
And the way that we differentiate between vector and scalar quantities ...

23
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:18,885
... is that we put little arrows on top of vector quantities.

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,000
Normally they are bolded ... you can have a type face ...

25
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,623
... and they have an arrow on the top of it.

26
00:01:23,638 --> 00:01:24,230
But this tells you ...

27
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:28,652
... that not only do I care about the value of this thing or I care about the size of this thing ...

28
00:01:28,698 --> 00:01:30,877
... I also care about its direction.

29
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:35,369
The arrow isn't a direction ... it just tells you that it is a vector quantity.

30
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:41,508
So the velocity of something is its change in position, ...

31
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:44,575
... including the direction of its change in postition.

32
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:49,323
So you can say its displacement ...

33
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:52,657
... and the letter for displacement is "s" ...

34
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:54,252
... and that its a vector quantity.

35
00:01:54,298 --> 00:01:56,031
So that is displacement.

36
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,323
And you might be wondering: ...

37
00:01:57,338 --> 00:02:01,146
... why dont they use "d" for displacement?

38
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:03,954
That seems like a much more natural first letter.

39
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:05,610
And my best sense of that is ...

40
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:07,356
... once you start doing calculus, ...

41
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:10,006
... you start using "d" for something very different ...

42
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:11,556
... you use it for the derivative operator.

43
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:14,231
And that's so that the "d"s don't get confused ...

44
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:16,505
... and thats why we use "s" for displacement.

45
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,456
If someone has a better explanation of that ...

46
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:22,195
... feel free to comment on this video ...

47
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,495
... and i'll add another video explaining that better explanation.

48
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:32,329
So velocity is your displacement over time.

49
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:36,895
If i wanted to write an analogous thing for the scalar quantities ...

50
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:39,802
... I could write that speed ...

51
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:43,187
... and I'll write out the words, so you don't get confused with displacement ...

52
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,864
... or maybe I will write rate.

53
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,295
Rate is another way that - sometimes - people write speed.

54
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:49,664
So this is the vector version ...

55
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,743
... if you care about direction.

56
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,269
If you don't care about direction ...

57
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:53,977
... you would have your rate.

58
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,192
So this is rate ... or speed ...

59
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:01,531
... is equal to the distance that you travel ...

60
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:03,833
... the distance that you travel ...

61
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,336
... over some time.

62
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:07,682
So these two ...

63
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:08,782
... you could call them formulas ...

64
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,109
... or you can call them definitions ...

65
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,880
... although I would think they are pretty intuitive for you.

66
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,027
How fast something is going ...

67
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,975
... you say how far did it go over some period of time.

68
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,752
These are essentially saying the same thing.

69
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:20,729
This is when you care about directions ...

70
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,305
... so you're dealing with vector quantities.

71
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:25,236
This is where you're not so conscientious about directon ...

72
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:27,275
... and so you use distance, which is scalar ...

73
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:29,205
... and you use rate or speed, which is scalar.

74
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:31,921
And here you use displacement and you use velocity.

75
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,190
Now with that out of the way ...

76
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,059
... let's figure out what his average velocity was.

77
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:39,098
And this key word average is interesting.

78
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,705
Because it's possible that his velocity was changing ...

79
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,575
... over that whole time period.

80
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:45,059
But for the sake of simplicity ...

81
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:45,886
... we're going to assume ...

82
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:47,313
... that it was kind of a constant velocity ...

83
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:50,475
... or what we are calculating is going to be his average velocity.

84
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,421
But don't worry about it.

85
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:54,675
You can just assume that it wasn't changing over that time period.

86
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:58,436
So, his velocity ... is ...

87
00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:01,875
... his displacement was 5 kilometers to the north ...

88
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:07,129
So his displacement ... The displacement was 5 kilometers ...

89
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,659
I'll write just a big capital.

90
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:09,729
Well, let me just write it out ...

91
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,752
... 5 kilometers north.

92
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:17,036
Over the amount of time it took him.

93
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:17,905
And let me make it clear ...

94
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:21,990
... this is change in time.

95
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,382
Sometimes ...

96
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:25,467
... - this is also a change in time - ...

97
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:27,475
... sometimes you'll just see a "t" written there.

98
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,298
Sometimes you'll see someone actually put this little triangle ...

99
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:32,244
... the character "delta" ...

100
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,159
... in front of it.

101
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,459
Which expicitly means "change in".

102
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,021
It looks like a very fancy mathematics when you see that.

103
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:43,336
But a triangle in front of something litterally means "change in".

104
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:44,821
So this is change in time.

105
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,829
So he goes 5 kilometers north ...

106
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,359
... and it took him 1 hour.

107
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,321
So the change in time was 1 hour.

108
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,082
So let me write that over here.

109
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,459
... so over 1 hour ....

110
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:57,621
So this is equal to ...

111
00:04:57,652 --> 00:05:00,921
... if you just look at the numerical part of it ....

112
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:03,436
... it is 5 over 1 ...

113
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:06,382
... let me just write it out ... 5 over 1 ...

114
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:07,821
... kilometers ...

115
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:11,629
... and you can treat the units the same way you would treat the quantities in a fraction.

116
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:21,021
5 over 1 kilometers per hour.

117
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:25,475
And then ... to the north.

118
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,944
Or you could say this is the same thing as ...

119
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:30,829
... 5 kilometers per hour north.

120
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:43,467
So this is 5 kilometers per hour to the north.

121
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,952
So that's his average velocity!

122
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,621
5 kilometers per hour ...

123
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:48,767
... and you have to be careful ...

124
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:51,021
... you have to say to the north if you want velocity.

125
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,675
If someone just said 5 kilometers per hour ...

126
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:54,366
... they're giving you a speed ...

127
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,170
... or rate ...

128
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:56,331
... or scalar quantity.

129
00:05:56,362 --> 00:06:00,308
You have to give the direction for it to be a vector quantity.

130
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,901
You could do the same thing if someone just said: ...

131
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,708
... what was his average speed over that time?

132
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:05,962
You could have said:

133
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:10,831
Well, his average speed or his rate would be the distance he travels ....

134
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:13,485
... we don't care about the direction now ...

135
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:15,262
... it's 5 kilometers ...

136
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:17,716
... and he does it in 1 hour.

137
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:21,201
His change in time is 1 hour.

138
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:28,147
So this is same thing as 5 kilometers per hour.

139
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:28,985
So once again:

140
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:31,162
We're only giving the magnitude here.

141
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,739
This is a scalar quantitiy.

142
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:36,008
If you want the vector you have to do the "north" as well.

143
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:36,847
Now you might be saying:

144
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:38,608
Hey, in the previous video ...

145
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:41,062
... we talked about things in the term of meters per second.

146
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:43,547
Here I gave you kilometers ...

147
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:46,262
... or kilometers depending on how you want to pronounce it ...

148
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,793
... kilometers per hour.

149
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,447
What if someone want it in meters per second ...

150
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:53,547
... or what if I just wanted to understand how many meters he travels in a second?

151
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:56,401
And there it just becomes a unit conversion problem.

152
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:59,070
And I figure it does not to hurt to work on that right now.

153
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:01,124
So if we wanted to do this to meters per second.

154
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,670
How would we do it?

155
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:07,262
Well, a first step is to think about how many meters we are traveling in an hour.

156
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,804
So let's take that 5 kilometers per hour ...

157
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:14,504
... and we want to convert it to meters.

158
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:17,097
So, I put meters in the numerator ...

159
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:18,704
... and I put kilometers in the denominator.

160
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:19,651
And the reason why I do that ...

161
00:07:19,697 --> 00:07:22,551
... is because the kilometers will cancel out with the kilometers.

162
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:25,051
And how many meters are there per kilometer?

163
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:29,381
Well, there's 1000 meters for every one kilometer.

164
00:07:29,412 --> 00:07:31,928
1000 meters for every one kilometer

165
00:07:31,943 --> 00:07:35,889
And I set this up right here, so that the kilometers cancel out.

166
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,774
So these two characters cancel out.

167
00:07:37,835 --> 00:07:41,889
And if you multiply you get 5 ...

168
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,666
... and then the only unit you have in ...

169
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:46,981
... oh, I should say 5000 ...

170
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:49,297
... so you have 5 times 1000 ....

171
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,120
... so this is ... so let me write this ...

172
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,681
... 5 times ... I'll do it in the same color ....

173
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:56,504
... 5 times 1000, so I just multiplied the numbers.

174
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:59,343
When you multiply something you can switch around the order.

175
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,181
Multiplication is communitativ ...

176
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:03,466
... I always have trouble pronouncing that in associative ...

177
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:05,012
... and then in the units ...

178
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:07,097
... in the numerator you have meters ...

179
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:11,028
... and in the denominator you have hours.

180
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,666
Meters per hour.

181
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:23,012
And so this is equal to 5000 meters per hour.

182
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:23,635
And you might say:

183
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,070
Hey Sal, you know, ... I could have ... you know, ...

184
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:28,193
... I know that 5 kilometers is the same thing as 5000 meters.

185
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,924
I could do that in my head.

186
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,362
And you probably could.

187
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,320
But this canceling out dimension ...

188
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:35,881
... or what it is often called "dimensional analysis" right here ...

189
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:38,916
... can get useful once you started doing really, really complicated things ...

190
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,724
... with less intuitiv units than something like this.

191
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,039
But you should always do an intuitiv gut check, right here.

192
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:48,970
You know that, if you do 5 kilometers in an hour that's a ton of meters, right?

193
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:52,516
So you should get a larger number if you're talking about meters per hour.

194
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:54,985
And now, when we want to go to seconds ...

195
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:56,562
... let's do an intuitiv gut check.

196
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:59,708
If something is traveling a certian amount an hour, ...

197
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:02,439
... it should travel a much smaller amount in a second ...

198
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:05,185
... or, you know, 1/3600 of an hour ...

199
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:08,454
... because that's how many seconds there are in an hour.

200
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:11,247
So that's your gut check. We should get a smaller number than this ....

201
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,501
... when we want to say meters per second.

202
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,724
But let's actually do it with dimensional analysis.

203
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:20,439
So we want to cancel out the hours and we want to be left with seconds in the denominator.

204
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:23,031
So the best way to cancel this hours in the denominator ...

205
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:27,654
... is by having hours in the numerator.

206
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,693
So you have hours per seconds.

207
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,239
So, how many hours are there per second?

208
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:35,631
Or another way to think about it: ...

209
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:37,747
... one hour - think about the larger unit - ...

210
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:39,785
... one hour is how many seconds?

211
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:44,378
Well, you have 60 seconds per minute ....

212
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:48,847
... times 60 minutes per second ...

213
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:54,762
... the minutes canc... oh Sorry! ... times 60 minutes per hour, I should say ...

214
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,524
... the minutes cancel out ....

215
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:59,562
...60 times 60 is 3600 ...

216
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:03,878
...seconds per hour.

217
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:05,978
Or if you flip it ...

218
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:09,401
... so you can say this is 3600 seconds for every 1 hour.

219
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,978
Or if you flip them, you would get ...

220
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:16,524
... 1 over 3600 hours - or hour - per second.

221
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:18,670
Or hours per second, depending on how you want to do it.

222
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:25,154
So one hour is the same thing as 3600 seconds.

223
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,054
And so now this hour cancels out with that hour ...

224
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,662
... and then you multiply or appropiatly divide the numbers right here.

225
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:40,854
And you get ... this is equal to 5000 over 3600 ...

226
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:47,801
... meters per ... all you have left in the denominator here is second ....

227
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:50,670
... meters per second.

228
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:54,231
And if we divide both, the numerator and the denominator ...

229
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:57,747
... I can do this by hand but just because this video is already getting a little bit long ...

230
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:03,816
... let me get my trusty calculator out ...

231
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,578
... just for the sake of time ...

232
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:08,662
... 5000 divided by 3600 ...

233
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,870
... which should be really the same thing as 50 divided by 36 ...

234
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:18,754
... that is 1.3 ... i'll just round it over here ... 1.39.

235
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:33,408
This is equal to 1.39 meters per second.

236
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:35,708
So Shantanu was traveling quite slow in his car.

237
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:37,501
And well, we knew that just by looking at this.

238
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:43,939
5 kilometers per hour, that's pretty much ... just like the car roll pretty slowly.
