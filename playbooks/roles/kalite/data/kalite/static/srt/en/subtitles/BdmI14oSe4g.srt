1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,390
   

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,350
I tried recording this possible
solution to the

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,330
bailout video just now, but
apparently the sound went bad

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,050
so I just restarted my computer,
so hopefully I won't

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,030
turn into slow motion
man again.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,300
Well, anyway, the whole
discussion so far has been

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,070
focused on how did the credit
crisis get started, and why

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,920
the card bailout proposal,
one, is wrong from just a

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,100
moral hazard and fairness point
of view, and why it

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,330
probably won't work even
to begin with.

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,100
So, you know, why
even go into it?

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,210
And some of you all said, well,

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,330
what could be a solution?

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,160
And I've argued a little bit
in the wealth destruction

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,700
video that you really can't
legislate against reality.

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,960
That you kind of have to
let things correct.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,170
You cannot create wealth
just by passing bills.

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,320
All you can kind of do
is shuffle around

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,600
who takes the losses.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,810
But in one of the videos, I
argued that if the government

21
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,380
was serious about helping Main
Street, about loans to Main

22
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,290
Street, why don't they lend
directly to Main Street?

23
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,580
And I kind of said it a little
bit flippantly that if that

24
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,040
was their intention, that's what
they should do with the

25
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,300
$700 billion.

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,575
And I got an email from a friend
from business school, a

27
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:08,990
very intelligent fellow who I
respect very much, and he has

28
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,980
a solution that I think
is essentially that.

29
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,200
Loan directly to Main Street.

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,190
Don't bail out these people
who have already acted

31
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,430
extremely irresponsibly and
essentially write them checks

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,940
from American taxpayers.

33
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,330
And his suggestion is, instead
of buying worthless assets,

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,460
why not create new banks fully
capitalized by the

35
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,770
government-- but you might not
even have to capitalize them--

36
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,000
and let those banks lend
directly to Main Street?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,540
And he makes a very
interesting point.

38
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,160
He says -- let me make sure that
I can fit all of this.

39
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,561
And I don't know if
you can read it.

40
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,290
I want this to all fit.

41
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,070
But he makes the interesting
point.

42
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,610
$700 billion of capital -- this
is his email that he sent

43
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,130
to me -- with $700 billion of
equity, this is more book

44
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,160
equity, and therefore more
lending power, than Bank of

45
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,150
America, J.P.

46
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,140
Morgan, Citigroup, Washington
Mutual, Wachovia, Goldman

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,490
Sachs, and Morgan Stanley
combined.

48
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,500
So combine these institutions,
which are really the pillars

49
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,770
of our financial system,
they represent $619

50
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,900
billion of book equity.

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,290
And remember, this is
their book equity.

52
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,740
This is what they say is the
book value of their assets.

53
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,100
But we've already learned that
they're probably being

54
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,490
overstated, and that's why we
have to go and buy them at

55
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,160
prices more than what
they're worth.

56
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,240
But this -- just to get an idea
how large of a dollar

57
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,200
amount this is -- this $700
billion is more than what

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,230
these banks say they're worth.

59
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,150
It's probably several
multiples of what

60
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,040
they really are worth.

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,390
Some of these banks probably
aren't worth anything.

62
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,390
And as it points out, the new
bank would have no prior

63
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,870
committed loans, so the
incremental amount of lending

64
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,250
available would be
much larger.

65
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,040
Which means you are not lending
into a black hole.

66
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,700
When you lend money or you
essentially give money to one

67
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,420
of these banks that have
all of these other bad

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,090
liabilities, your money's
essentially just being poured

69
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,050
into a black hole and there's no
assurance that that bank is

70
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,010
going to go and then lend that
money to other people, and go

71
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,830
to main street.

72
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,660
But if you inject it into
a bank with a completely

73
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,570
pristine balance sheet, a new
bank -- you could call it you

74
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,610
know the Bank of Washington,
the Bank of Jefferson.

75
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,690
And I would actually recommend
having multiple banks, just so

76
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,050
you have competition and you
don't have that too big to

77
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,360
fail problem.

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,070
But these banks, they would have
pristine balance sheets,

79
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,320
and they would go out and make
loans, and they would go out

80
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,880
and make loans wherever
it is most prudent.

81
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,790
And he says, you know, this
accomplishes the goal of

82
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,580
injecting lending capital into
the system without creating

83
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,100
the moral hazard problem, and at
the end of a few years, the

84
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,910
government will probably be able
to IPO sell the bank for

85
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,530
more than one times book value,
which will include the

86
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,070
original $700 billion,
generating a substantial

87
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,070
profit to the taxpayer.

88
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,820
Exactly.

89
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,920
In fact, they could either do
that, the government could own

90
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,880
it and then try to IPO it in
five years or so, like Todd

91
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,940
suggests, or another option is
maybe each of these banks--

92
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,180
maybe the bank takes $700
billion and creates 10 banks

93
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,420
that each have $70 billion in
initial equity capital.

94
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,850
And maybe the government issues
300 million shares of

95
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,450
each of those banks, and every
American man, woman, and child

96
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,040
gets one share of each
of those banks.

97
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,220
I think that would have a very
powerful political statement.

98
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,890
And it actually would
make economic sense.

99
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,700
All of a sudden you would have
the American people are now

100
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,650
the owners of the banking
system, instead of this

101
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,850
concentrated wealth that's
really formed over the past

102
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,150
150 years in the old
banking system.

103
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,820
And then, you know, he
goes on to point

104
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,230
out some other things.

105
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,510
Sure, the more current banks
would fail probably quicker,

106
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,860
and we all know that's
a good thing.

107
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,980
What happened in Japan?

108
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,740
What happened in Japan is we
kept infusing capital into--

109
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,390
well, we didn't, the Japanese
government kept infusing-- or

110
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,730
either did it themselves or
coaxed other people to infuse

111
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,140
capital into banks that were
essentially zombie banks, that

112
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,270
were insolvent, and
just slowed down.

113
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,900
It slowed down the downfall, and
essentially led to their

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,480
lost decade.

115
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,580
So he says, you know, more banks
would fail, but many of

116
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,550
them probably would be deserve
to fail, and the financial

117
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,400
system would be preserved.

118
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,810
I agree with him completely.

119
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,240
If the new bank wants to
lend new money to new

120
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,910
borrowers, it can.

121
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,380
Or if it thinks it will make
more money buying up old

122
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,000
loans, like the CDOs or the
residential mortgage backed

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,850
securities, at a deep discount,
it can do this too.

124
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,670
But it will be making a clear
economic profit decision.

125
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,290
And I'd add-- just so that we
make sure that the management

126
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,700
of these new entities, so that
they are aligned with

127
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,000
profit-making as opposed to
bailing out their own previous

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,190
past bad decisions, or bailing
out the people who they used

129
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,300
to work with-- I would
try to not put these

130
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,290
banks in New York.

131
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,620
Maybe you put them in Detroit
and New Orleans and Stockton,

132
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,580
California, which is the
foreclosure capital of the

133
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,830
world, of the country.

134
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,510
Put them in places that are
separate from Wall Street.

135
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,800
Hire very intelligent people
who have some distance from

136
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,020
what has happened the last five,
six years in Michigan.

137
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,200
And I'll tell you, there are
tons and tons of very

138
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,040
competent, very intelligent
managers who understand these

139
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,000
issues deeply in this country.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,380
Unfortunately, a lot of
them haven't been

141
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,420
heads of banks lately.

142
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,550
And they would be happy to work
for something less than

143
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,910
$20 million a year.

144
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,240
In fact, I think many of
them would do it out

145
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,940
of patriotic duty.

146
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,900
But you could pay them $100
thousand a year, and then you

147
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,660
could say, you know what?

148
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,420
You, as the new employees of
these new American banks that

149
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,090
are owned by the American
people-- and they can be

150
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,150
traded on an exchange, so it's
essentially immediately

151
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,520
privatized.

152
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,755
It's never owned by
the government.

153
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:28,730
It's immediately owned by the
private sector, by the

154
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,690
American people, not
by the government.

155
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,510
When I say American people,
it's literally owned by

156
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,190
private individuals, not
by the government.

157
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,290
But you can actually create an
incentive structure, that

158
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:42,230
whatever the equity value of
your company is five years

159
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,090
out, you all, as the employees,

160
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,970
share 1% of the benefit.

161
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,560
And that's actually a huge
number, that actually

162
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,280
might be too much.

163
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,000
But you'll be able to hire
excellent managers, especially

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,720
considering how many people
are getting laid off right

165
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,750
now, very intelligent people
because of bad, risky

166
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,130
decisions made by others.

167
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,440
But then he finishes up, I
recognize this will be less

168
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,450
politically popular among
banking lobbyists, but see it

169
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,050
as a much better way to, one,
protect the financial system--

170
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,240
I agree with him completely--
two, minimize the risk,

171
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,120
maximize the reward to
the U.S. government.

172
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,000
And he welcomes any comments,
criticisms. And I think it's

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,450
interesting, he started off
the idea, he says, "The

174
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,060
problem is this sort of plan
would be political suicide,

175
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,370
with key financial donors to
political campaigns." And

176
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,270
that's true.

177
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,860
Unfortunately-- I think this
is a good idea, but I think

178
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,130
the current old banking system
has a much more receptive ear

179
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,470
of our government unfortunately,
than I, or

180
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,940
Todd, or frankly the American
people seem to have right now.

181
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,600
But anyway, I was kind of
parsing Todd's email.

182
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,950
Let me actually draw out a plan
of what this would be.

183
00:07:53,950 --> 00:08:01,170
So you take $700 billion-- and
let me write that out-- 700,

184
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,840
that's thousand, that's million,
that's billion.

185
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,830
You take that $700 billion,
and you-- I don't know, I

186
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,340
think the more banks
the better.

187
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,370
You want competition.

188
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,960
You don't want to have this
too big to fail problem.

189
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,720
So you take that $700 billion,
and the first time I recorded

190
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,340
this video, I said you
put it in 10 banks.

191
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,340
But, I don't know, let's put it
in-- let's see, 700 divided

192
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,800
by 10 banks would be
$70 billion each.

193
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,390
If you do what?

194
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,049
If you do 70 banks, you would
have $10 billion each.

195
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,090
So let's do that.

196
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,120
Put it in 70 different banks.

197
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,370
70 different banks.

198
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,049
Or maybe do it in 50 different
banks, one bank for each state

199
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,070
of the country.

200
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,000
70 different banks.

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,440
I mean, that sounds crazy, but
when you think about what the

202
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,670
government was originally--

203
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,020
Actually, let's do 50 banks.

204
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,310
I like the sound of that.

205
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,660
One bank in every
state, right?

206
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,180
And they're not all concentrated
in New York, and

207
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,740
they're not, you know, so
you get fresh thought,

208
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,780
fresh blood in them.

209
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,760
And they might actually hire
people that are getting laid

210
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,680
off in the manufacturing sector
or the real estate

211
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,030
sector or whatever.

212
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,410
You take 50 different banks.

213
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,970
You capitalize them
each with what?

214
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,990
50 goes into 700 billion
14 times?

215
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,240
Right.

216
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,220
14, let's see, 15 -- right,
goes in 14 times.

217
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,450
So you capitalize them each
with $14 billion, so their

218
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,920
balance sheets are going
to look like this.

219
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,500
Equity-- this is each bank-- $14
billion of initial equity.

220
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,200
And they're going to have
300 million shares,

221
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,480
one for every American.

222
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,210
And if they don't like
the holding shares,

223
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,210
they can sell them.

224
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,100
They'll all IPO on
the exchanges.

225
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,780
And then these will be member
banks of the Fed.

226
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,550
And so they'll be regulated,
but they can

227
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,350
lever up 10 to one.

228
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,330
So they can, let's say with $14
billion of assets, each of

229
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,060
these banks can control $100--
with $14 billion of equity,

230
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,560
each of these banks can control

231
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,790
$140 billion of assets.

232
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,200
Which, essentially, that's $140
billion that they can

233
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,250
lend out to the world.

234
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,800
If they see good returns, good
economic investment in Main

235
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,220
Street, they'll do it there.

236
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,080
If they think that some of the
existing banks are actually

237
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,780
good credit risks, that they
could lend maybe to J.P.

238
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,630
Morgan, or Bank of America,
they'll do it.

239
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,330
Maybe they won't do it at 6%
like the Fed wants them to, or

240
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,440
at 2%, or whatever, they'll say
that's a little risky, or

241
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,875
maybe I'll do it
at 10% or 12%.

242
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,110
And this is another side note
I'd like to say, it seems like

243
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,640
the Fed is getting frustrated
that it wants to dictate that

244
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,850
banks have to lend to each
other at 2%, but they're

245
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,010
willing to only lend to
each other at 6%.

246
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,340
And so it's losing control over
that notion of what banks

247
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,390
lend to each other at.

248
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,950
6% is still low.

249
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,370
If I have to lend money to
someone who could go under

250
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,930
next week, I want at
least 12% or 15%.

251
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,090
And I don't think that's
a crazy interest rate.

252
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,330
That's what people were paying
in the early '80s, and they

253
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,680
weren't talking about financial

254
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,460
Armageddon back then.

255
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,845
But anyway, each of these banks
would have $140 billion

256
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:06,170
in assets, and then-- I don't
know, how much in liability?

257
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:11,790
Let's see, 140 minus 14 is $124
billion in liabilities.

258
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,600
And they would be very
easy to borrow money.

259
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,770
These banks would have an easy
time borrowing money from a

260
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,940
bunch of different people.

261
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,740
And why is that?

262
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,850
Well, one, they have completely

263
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,820
pristine balance sheets.

264
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,570
No one worries about what kind
of stinky things they have on

265
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,500
this side, because it's
all new investments.

266
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,100
And then if the government
really wants to make sure that

267
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,460
these banks get off the ground
running, they can make them a

268
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,770
temporary government
back stop on it.

269
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,440
So essentially, they could
be government-sponsored

270
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,580
enterprises, but not
indefinitely.

271
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,490
We don't want a Fanny Mae,
Freddie Mac again.

272
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,560
You could say five year
government back stop.

273
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,520
   

274
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,840
Which essentially says, if you
lend to these banks over the

275
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,000
next five years, anyone lending
to these banks over

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,540
the next five years, if for
whatever reason these banks

277
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,760
were to go under you
will be made whole.

278
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,910
So there's literally no risk to
investing in these banks.

279
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:08,470
And frankly, frankly, if just
this five year government back

280
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,240
stop on these banks, I think
will encourage people to

281
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,280
invest equity in these banks,
and the government might not

282
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,470
even have to put these $14
billion in each bank.

283
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,710
But anyway, I've run
out of time.

284
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,980
I'll continue this in
the next video.

285
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,000
