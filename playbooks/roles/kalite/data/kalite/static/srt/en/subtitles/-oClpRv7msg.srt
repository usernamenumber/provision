1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,869
We have talked a little bit about the law of demand

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:05,729
which tells us that, all else equal,

3
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:08,515
if we raise the price of a product,

4
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:11,816
then the quantity demanded for that product will go down.

5
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:13,333
..common sense. If we lower the price,

6
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,856
the quantity demanded will go up.

7
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:16,856
And we will see so in a few special cases for this.

8
00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:18,925
What I want to do in this video is focus on

9
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:21,502
these other things that we've been holding equal,

10
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:23,674
the things that allow us to make this statement,

11
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:25,708
that allow us to move along this curve

12
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,187
and think about if we were to change one of those things

13
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:30,067
that we were otherwise considering equal,

14
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:32,390
how does that change the actual curve?

15
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,623
How does that actually change

16
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:37,390
the whole quantity demanded price relationship?

17
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,405
And so the first of these that I will focus on:

18
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:43,867
the first is the price of competing products.

19
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:50,734
The Price of Competing Products. [WRTING]

20
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:53,128
So if you assume that the price of...

21
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:54,877
actually, I shouldn't say Competing Products,

22
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:57,423
I will say the price of Related Products because [WRITING]

23
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:00,365
we will see that they are not all competing.

24
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:04,938
Price of Related Products ... is one of the things

25
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:07,975
that we are assuming is constant when we,

26
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:10,903
it‘s been held equal when we show this relationship.

27
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:13,600
We're assuming that these other things aren't changing.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,733
Now what would happen if these things changed ?

29
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:32,599
Well, imagine we have other, say other ebooks' price goes up. [WRITING]

30
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:35,540
The price of other ebooks go up.

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,119
So what will that do

32
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,867
to our price quantity demanded relationship ?

33
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,721
If other ebooks' prices go up,

34
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:45,332
now all of a sudden my ebook,

35
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:47,605
regardless of what price point we're at,

36
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:49,057
at any of the price points,

37
00:01:49,057 --> 00:01:51,682
my ebook is going to look more desirable.

38
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:54,000
At $2, it is more likely that people will want it,

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,666
more people will want it

40
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,363
because the other stuff's more expensive.

41
00:01:57,363 --> 00:01:59,138
At $4, more people will want it.

42
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:01,034
At $6, more people will want it.

43
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,871
$8, more people will want it, $10 more people will want it.

44
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,743
So if this were to happen,

45
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:09,600
that would actually shift the entire demand curve to the right.

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,734
So it would start to look something like this...

47
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,575
it would look something like that.

48
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:18,738
We'll call that Scenario 1. That is Scenario 1.

49
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,428
And these other ebooks,

50
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:23,605
we can call them substitutes for my product.

51
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:25,672
So this right over here...

52
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:31,062
These other ebooks, these are substitutes. [WRITING]

53
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:32,608
If, people might say,

54
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:34,373
oh you know that other book looks kind of comparable,

55
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:36,200
if one is more expensive and one is cheaper,

56
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,471
maybe I'll read one or the other.

57
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:40,477
So, in order to make this statement,

58
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:42,529
in order to stay along this curve,

59
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,738
we have to assume that this thing is constant.

60
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:47,595
If this thing changes, this is going to move the curve.

61
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:49,097
If other ebooks prices go up,

62
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,077
it will probably shift our curve to the right.

63
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:53,559
If other ebooks‘ prices go down,

64
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:56,025
that will shift our entire curve to the left.

65
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,433
So this is actually changing our demand,

66
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,733
it’s changing our whole relationship.

67
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:03,233
So it‘s shifting demand to the right.

68
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:08,964
Let me write that, so this is going to shift Demand... [WRITING]

69
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:13,185
so the entire relationship: Demand to the right. [WRITING]

70
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:15,992
I really want to make sure you have this point clear.

71
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:17,800
When we hold everything else equal,

72
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,959
we're moving along a given demand curve.

73
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,164
We are essentially saying: the demand,

74
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:26,613
the Price Quantity demanded relationship is held constant

75
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:27,968
and we can pick a price

76
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:29,677
and we'll get a certain quantity demanded.

77
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,933
We are moving along the curve.

78
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,995
If we change one of those things,

79
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:36,056
we might actually shift the curve.

80
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:38,733
Once we change this demand schedule,

81
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:41,179
which will change this curve.

82
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,797
Now if we...there are other related products,

83
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:46,015
they don't just have to be substitutes.

84
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:50,246
So for example, let's think about Scenario, a Scenario 2.

85
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:55,892
Or maybe the price of a....the price of a Kindle goes up, [WRITING]

86
00:03:55,892 --> 00:04:01,680
so the price of a Kindle...let me write it this way: [WRITING]

87
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,252
Kindle's price goes up. [WRITING]

88
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:08,134
Now the Kindle is not a substitute.

89
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:10,600
People don't either buy an e-book or

90
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,966
they won't either buy my ebook or buy a Kindle.

91
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:17,333
Kindle is a complement, you actually need a Kindle or an Ipad

92
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,898
or something like it in order to consume my ebook.

93
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:24,379
So this right over here, this right over here is a complement.

94
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,587
It is a complement. [WRITING]

95
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:28,425
So if a complement's price becomes more expensive,

96
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:29,682
and this is something that...

97
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:32,277
one of the things that people might use to buy my book,

98
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:34,326
then it would actually, for any given price,

99
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:36,559
lower the quantity demanded.

100
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,829
So in this situation, if my book is $2,

101
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:41,067
since fewer people are going to have Kindles,

102
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,454
or maybe they have used some of their money

103
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:43,764
already to buy the Kindle,

104
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:45,341
they're gonna have less to buy my book

105
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:47,918
or just fewer people will have the Kindle.

106
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,441
For any given price, it’s going to lower the quantity demanded.

107
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,541
For any given price.

108
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,045
And so essentially, it will shift,

109
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,271
it will change the entire demand curve.

110
00:04:57,271 --> 00:04:59,462
It will shift the demand curve to the left.

111
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:01,729
So this right over here is scenario 2.

112
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,413
And you can imagine the other way,

113
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:06,036
if the Kindle's price went down, then that would shift

114
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,677
my demand curve to the right.

115
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:11,128
If the price of substitutes went down,

116
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:13,979
then that would shift my entire curve to the left.

117
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,215
So you can think about all these scenarios.

118
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,310
And actually I encourage you to,

119
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,944
think about and draw them yourselves, think about products...

120
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,100
could be an ebook or could be some other type of product

121
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,933
and think about what would happen.

122
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,687
Well (1) one, think about what the related products are,

123
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:27,241
the substitutes and potentially complements

124
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:29,964
and then think what would happen as those prices change.

125
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:32,179
And always keep in mind, the difference between demand

126
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:35,256
which is this entire relationship, the entire curve,

127
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:38,333
that we can move along if we hold everything else equal

128
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,402
and only change price,

129
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:43,025
and quantity demanded, which is a particular quantity

130
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:47,640
for a particular price holding everything else equal.
