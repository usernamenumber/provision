1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420
   

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:13,470
We have the equation 3/4x plus
2 is equal to 3/8x minus 4.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,129
Now, we could just, right from
the get go, solve this the way

4
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,070
we solved everything else, group
the x terms, maybe on

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,440
the left-hand side, group the
constant terms on the

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,470
right-hand side.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,980
But adding and subtracting
fractions are messy.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,110
So what I'm going to do, right
from the start of this video,

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,470
is to multiply both sides of
this equation by some number

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,300
so I can get rid of
the fractions.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,880
And the best number to do it
by-- what number is the

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,050
smallest number that if I
multiply both of these

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,320
fractions by it, they won't be
fractions anymore, they'll be

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,530
whole numbers?

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,350
That smallest number
is going to be 8.

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,130
   

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,080
I'm going to multiply 8 times
both sides of this equation.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,920
You say, hey, Sal, how
did you get 8?

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,300
And I got 8 because I said,
well, what's the least common

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,650
multiple of 4 and 8?

21
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,600
Well, the smallest number that
is divisible by 4 and 8 is 8.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,580
So when you multiply
by 8, it's going to

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,720
get rid of the fractions.

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,300
And so let's see what happens.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,600
So 8 times 3/4, that's
the same thing as 8

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,350
times 3 over 4.

27
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,600
Let me do it on the
side over here.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,320
That's the same thing as 8 times
3 over 4, which is equal

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,440
to 8 divided by 4 is just 2.

30
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,160
So it's 2 times 3, which is 6.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,800
So the left-hand side becomes
8 times 3/4x is 6x.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,610
And then 8 times 2 is 16.

33
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,800
You have to remember, when you
multiply both sides, or a

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,070
side, of an equation by a
number, you multiply every

35
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,040
term by that number.

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,920
So you have to distribute
the 8.

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,040
So the left-hand side is 6x plus
16 is going to be equal

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,240
to-- 8 times 3/8, that's pretty
easy, the 8's cancel

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,580
out and you're just
left with 3x.

40
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,430
And then 8 times negative
4 is negative 32.

41
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,130
And now we've cleaned up the
equation a good bit.

42
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,690
Now the next thing, let's try to
get all the x terms on the

43
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,890
left-hand side, and all the
constant terms on the right.

44
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,220
So let's get rid of this
3x from the right.

45
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,740
Let's subtract 3x from
both sides to do it.

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,250
That's the best way I can think
of of getting rid of the

47
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,320
3x from the right.

48
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,180
The left-hand side of this
equation, 6x minus 3x is 3x.

49
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,890
6 minus 3 is 3.

50
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,380
And then you have a plus 16 is
equal to-- 3x minus 3x, that's

51
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,530
the whole point of subtracting
3x, is so they cancel out.

52
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,870
So those guys cancel out, and
we're just left with a

53
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,220
negative 32.

54
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,860
Now, let's get rid of the 16
from the left-hand side.

55
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,550
So to get rid of it, we're going
to subtract 16 from both

56
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,950
sides of this equation.

57
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,200
Subtract 16 from both sides.

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,600
The left-hand side of the
equation just becomes-- you

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,650
have this 3x here; these 16's
cancel out, you don't have to

60
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,420
write anything-- is equal to
negative 32 minus 16 is

61
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,910
negative 48.

62
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,325
So we have 3x is equal
to negative 48.

63
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:05,820
To isolate the x, we can just
divide both sides of this

64
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,350
equation by 3.

65
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,940
So let's divide both sides
of that equation by 3.

66
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,510
The left-hand side of the
equation, 3x divided by

67
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,310
3 is just an x.

68
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,750
That was the whole point
behind dividing

69
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,480
both sides by 3.

70
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,830
And the right-hand side,
negative 48 divided by 3 is

71
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,710
negative 16.

72
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,036
And we are done.

73
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:30,910
x equals negative 16
is our solution.

74
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,300
So let's make sure that this
actually works by substituting

75
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,920
to the original equation
up here.

76
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,030
And the original equation
didn't have

77
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,260
those 8's out front.

78
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,270
So let's substitute in the
original equation.

79
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:50,710
We get 3/4-- 3 over 4-- times
negative 16 plus 2 needs to be

80
00:03:50,710 --> 00:04:02,010
equal to 3/8 times negative
16 minus 4.

81
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,390
So 3/4 of 16 is 12.

82
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,680
And you can think
of it this way.

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,550
What's 16 divided by 4?

84
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,670
It is 4.

85
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,040
And then multiply that
by 3, it's 12,

86
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,450
just multiplying fractions.

87
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,390
So this is going to
be a negative 12.

88
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,920
So we get negative 12 plus
2 on the left-hand side,

89
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,800
negative 12 plus 2
is negative 10.

90
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,650
So the left-hand side
is a negative 10.

91
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,120
Let's see what the right-hand
side is.

92
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,360
You have 3/8 times
negative 16.

93
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,940
If you divide negative 16 by 8,
you get negative 2, times 3

94
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,970
is a negative 6.

95
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,710
So it's a negative 6 minus 4.

96
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,060
Negative 6 minus 4
is negative 10.

97
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,030
So when x is equal to negative
16, it does satisfy the

98
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,730
original equation.

99
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,560
Both sides of the equation
become negative 10.

100
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,330
And we are done.

101
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,333
