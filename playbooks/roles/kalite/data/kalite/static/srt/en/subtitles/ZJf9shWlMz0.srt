1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,370
Let's say I have a line, let
me make it a straight line.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,060
And the equation of that line,
since it's running in the

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,320
horizontal direction is
going to be y is equal

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,656
to some constant.

6
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:12,970
So let me write that.

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,010
So the equation of this line
right here is y is equal to k.

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,760
And let's say I have
some other point.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,650
I'll call that-- well, we'll
call that a focus because

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,886
it will be a focus.

11
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:29,890
And let's say that point--
let's put it right here-- is

12
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:36,300
it the coordinate, let's
call it a comma b.

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,915
And let's think about the set
of all points or the locus of

14
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,370
all points that are equidistant
to this point right

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,720
here and this line.

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,800
Just so you get the
terminology we'll call

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,770
this line a directrix.

18
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,500
Let me write that down.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,050
Directrix, it's probably a word
you've never heard before.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,640
And frankly, I've never heard
it outside of the context

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,190
of parabolas or conic
sections in general.

22
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,150
So let's call that a directrix.

23
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,090
This is our focus.

24
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,150
And what we want to do is we
want to find all of the points

25
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,590
in the xy-plane that are
equidistant to this focus

26
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,560
and this directrix.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,090
So there's one point that just
by looking at it we could say

28
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,162
is going to be in our locus.

29
00:01:22,162 --> 00:01:26,060
So it's going to be right there
because clearly, this point is

30
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,750
equidistant; it's halfway
between that point

31
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,380
and this line.

32
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,500
Now let's see what
other points.

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,900
There will probably be this
point right here because the

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,170
distance from there to there
is this name as the distance

35
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,410
from if you just drop
a line straight down.

36
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,330
Remember, we want to get the
shortest distance between

37
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,380
this point and the line.

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,380
We could have said something
like this distance, but this

39
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,370
distance wouldn't be the
shortest distance between

40
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,250
this point and this line.

41
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,250
So you would go straight
down to the line there.

42
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,920
Likewise, this point
would be there.

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,960
So that distance is the
same as that distance.

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,420
And you can already, I
think, begin to imagine

45
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,580
the type of shape this is.

46
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,960
And if you look at the title of
this video you can probably

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,990
guess where this is going.

48
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:14,630
That the shape is going to
look something like this.

49
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,320
Or something pretty similar to
what we know as a parabola.

50
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,800
And actually, it
will be a parabola.

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,000
There's no mystery there.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,740
But what we're doing this in
this video is actually show

53
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,535
you that is a parabola.

54
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:26,570
Show it to you mathematically
instead of this

55
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,420
little drawing here.

56
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,390
Where I show you that it kind
of looks like it would be a

57
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,750
parabola because this distance
right here looks about the same

58
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,510
as that distance right there.

59
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,750
I could keep going up and down
the curve and keep doing that,

60
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,080
but that's not satisfactory.

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,830
Let's actually mathematically
show that the locus of all

62
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,300
points that are equidistant to
this point and this line-- this

63
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,320
focus and this directrix--
is in fact, a parabola.

64
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,870
So let's say I have some point
that's in this locus and let me

65
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,710
call the point here-- let me do
it in a different color because

66
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,570
it's the same color as
my directrix-- x, y.

67
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,980
So I want to find all of the x,
y's-- all of the points that

68
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,220
satisfy an equation where their
distance to the focus is equal

69
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,590
to their distance
to the directrix.

70
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,480
So what's the distance
between x, y and the focus?

71
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,790
What's this distance
right here?

72
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,950
d sub 1.

73
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,076
Well, we just used the
distance formula.

74
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:26,656
It's x minus the
x-coordinate of the focus.

75
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:30,350
So it's x minus a squared.

76
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,250
So the difference in
the x's squared.

77
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,366
Plus the difference in the y's
squared-- y minus b squared.

78
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:40,690
The square root of that.

79
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,810
So this is the distance
to the focus.

80
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,310
So I'll call that d sub 1.

81
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,870
That's this distance
right there.

82
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,830
And we want to find all of the
x and y's where the distance to

83
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,320
the focus is equal to
the distance to this

84
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,970
line right there.

85
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,730
So if we call this distance--
let's call this the d sub 2--

86
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,480
the distance to the directrix.

87
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,390
So the distance to the focus is
going to be equal to d sub 2.

88
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,700
And d sub 2, what's this
going to be equal to?

89
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,790
Well, it's just the difference
in y because no matter where we

90
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,250
are we're just going to drop
down straight to the directrix.

91
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,400
So the difference in y-- I
could just say y minus k.

92
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,180
That would be the
difference in y.

93
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,620
But in this case I did make it
so that the coordinate up here

94
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,690
is higher than the k over here.

95
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,420
But what if we had a situation
where this point was

96
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,280
below this line?

97
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,440
I mean, there's nothing here
that I said that we can only

98
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,930
deal with points
above this line.

99
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,930
We haven't proven that
to ourselves yet.

100
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,020
So to make sure that this
distance is positive we could

101
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,350
take the absolute value or
we could just square it and

102
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,910
then take the square root.

103
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,020
And then that ensures that
we're not dealing with

104
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,560
negative distances.

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,590
So here we set up the equation
for all of the x's and y's

106
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,400
where the distance to the focus
is equal to the distance

107
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,940
to the directrix.

108
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,070
And let's see if this actually
turns out to be a parabola.

109
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,750
So the first thing we can do is
we can square both sides and

110
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,660
get rid of the radicals.

111
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,010
So we get x minus a squared.

112
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,160
Radicals aren't good.

113
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,730
Well, I don't want to make
any social commentary.

114
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:20,340
So x minus a squared plus y
minus b squared is equal to

115
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:26,620
the square root of the other
side-- y minus k squared.

116
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,540
And right now, at least, it
looks like there's going to be

117
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,120
some y squared terms and I mean
there's definitely

118
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,580
an x squared term.

119
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,420
That doesn't seem like it's
a parabola right now.

120
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,000
But let's keep going forward.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,585
This is x minus a squared.

122
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:43,650
And then let me square
these-- actually, expand

123
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,730
these two binomials.

124
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:55,560
So plus y squared minus 2yb
plus b squared is equal to y

125
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,600
squared minus 2yk
plus k squared.

126
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,020
Now what can we do
to simplify this?

127
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,960
Well, we have a y squared
here and we have a y squared

128
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,460
on the right-hand side.

129
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,260
So we can subtract y
squared from both

130
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,242
sides of the equation.

131
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:14,520
They cancel out, and then we
got rid of the y squared so all

132
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,580
of a sudden this is starting to
look a lot more like a parabola

133
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,260
because this is now an equation
that relates y's

134
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,170
to an x squared.

135
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,250
So let's clean this up and
actually make sure that we can

136
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,860
get it in a form that we
normally associate

137
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,210
with a parabola.

138
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:34,460
So we now have-- I'll just
rewrite it-- x minus a squared

139
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:42,260
minus 2yb plus b squared is
equal to minus 2yk

140
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,780
plus k squared.

141
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,250
Now what can we do?

142
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,550
Let's take all the y's
and the constants on one

143
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,860
side of the equation.

144
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,660
So if we move both of these
terms onto the right-hand

145
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,260
side, so we want to
add 2yb to both sides.

146
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,970
So we get x minus a squared is
equal to-- I'm moving both of

147
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,845
these terms to the
right-hand side.

148
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:07,740
So if we add 2yb to both sides
then we'll have a positive

149
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,490
2yb on the right hand side.

150
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:17,670
So 2yb, and then we'll have
that minus 2yk right there.

151
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,520
And then we're subtracting
b squared from both sides.

152
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,720
So it's minus b squared
plus k squared.

153
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,330
I just arbitrarily decided to
write whatever I transferred

154
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,710
from the left-hand side to the
right-hand side in magenta

155
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,590
just so maybe it makes
it a little bit clearer.

156
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,400
And let's see if we can
simplify this further.

157
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,420
And remember, just so you know
what I'm doing this whole time.

158
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,770
In the back of my mind I'm
trying to get it into the

159
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,170
format that I normally
associate with a parabola.

160
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,940
And I'll do it in the corner
here, just so you know

161
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,450
where the algebra's going.

162
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm trying to get into a
format x minus a squared

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,870
is equal to y minus b.

164
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,360
Because if we have it in
this form, or actually ax.

165
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,580
Let me write that because I
went too far to the right.

166
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,910
A times x minus-- well,
actually I already used

167
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,260
the A so let me write x
minus-- I don't know.

168
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,830
I'll make up x minus--
I'll call that v squared.

169
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,120
I'm picking maybe v for
x value of the vertex.

170
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,010
I'm making up
variables on the fly.

171
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,930
A times x minus v squared
is equal to y minus b.

172
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,000
And you know, the actual
letters I chose don't matter.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,860
But this is a general
form of a parabola.

174
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,970
And this is where
I'm trying to go.

175
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,200
If I can get this thing that
we're working on to this

176
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,410
form then we know we're
dealing with a parabola.

177
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,130
And then, we can actually
relate what we normally

178
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,830
associate with a parabola
to these terms up here.

179
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,120
And obviously, these
are different letters

180
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,270
than these letters.

181
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,760
And then we can try to figure
out-- if we have a parabola,

182
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,590
how do we figure out its
focus and is directrix.

183
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,110
But anyway, that was a bit
of an aside just so you

184
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,790
know where we're going.

185
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,516
So let's try to simplify
this a little bit more.

186
00:08:57,516 --> 00:08:58,857
So we get--

187
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:00,350
[PHONE RINGING]

188
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,010
--my phone is ringing.

189
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,200
Let me silent it.

190
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,000
So we get x minus a squared
is equal to-- let's see.

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,540
If we factor out a 2 and
a y we get-- let me

192
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,520
factor out a y first.

193
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,080
We get 2b minus 2k times y.

194
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,260
And then I want to make
it minus some constant.

195
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,460
So this is a constant
right here.

196
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,650
This is one constant squared
plus another constant.

197
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:36,750
So I could make this
equal to minus-- let

198
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,540
me think about this.

199
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,410
This would be minus b
squared minus k squared.

200
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,610
If I expand this minus out
you would get minus b

201
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,870
squared plus k squared.

202
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,380
So this is the same
thing right there.

203
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,870
And let's see.

204
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,840
Can I factor out-- yeah,
I can factor out a 2.

205
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,540
The whole thing becomes x minus
a squared is equal to 2 times b

206
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:07,360
minus k times y minus-- and now
this is the difference of--

207
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,680
yeah, this is b plus
k times b minus k.

208
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,970
You might want to review
factoring polynomials if

209
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,560
that doesn't look familiar.

210
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,780
But this is b plus
k times b minus k.

211
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,285
And I want to do that because I
saw this b minus k out there so

212
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:27,230
that looked interesting to get
it on both terms right there.

213
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,740
Now let's see.

214
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,060
If we divide everything times--
let's divide everything by 1

215
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,660
over 2 b minus k because I just
want a y here, so I have some

216
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,800
coefficient in front of the y.

217
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,330
So let's divide everything
by 1 over 2 b minus k.

218
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,420
   

219
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,430
Let me do it down here
so I have some space.

220
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:57,660
1 over 2 b minus k times x
minus a squared is equal to--

221
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,120
I'm dividing this by 2 b
minus k, so that goes away.

222
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,150
So it's y minus-- so if I
divide this by 2 b minus k the

223
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:18,780
b minus k's cancel out and I'm
just left with b plus k over 2.

224
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,340
And I think I have gotten it
in the form that I wanted.

225
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,480
In this case, the a that
I wrote up here is now

226
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,550
1 over 2 b minus k.

227
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,150
This v is this a
that I did here.

228
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,400
The y is the y and then my
constant term is out here.

229
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,800
So I have hopefully shown to
you that the locus of all

230
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,180
points that are equidistant to
this point-- which is really

231
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,230
just an arbitrary point.

232
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,110
I said it's the point a,
b-- and some line, is

233
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,440
in fact, a parabola.

234
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,960
And that's one of the ways that
people define a parabola.

235
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,300
And we'll actually see soon
that when you actually change

236
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,930
this relation-- in this case,
we found that all of the points

237
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,980
that are equidistant to the
focus and the directrix.

238
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,760
If we changed that ratio, if we
find all of the points that are

239
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,010
1/2 as far away from the
directrix as the focus, we

240
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,830
start getting another
conic section.

241
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,410
If we said twice as far
we would get another

242
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,060
conic section.

243
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,320
So this is a very interesting
way of relating-- sometimes the

244
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,850
conic sections in the first
video I showed how they're all

245
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,970
related to cutting the
three-dimensional cone.

246
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,610
But they're also related in
this way and eventually I want

247
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,130
to relate this to the
three-dimensional cone so you

248
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,790
can see how it all
fits together.

249
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,810
Which is always the fun
thing about mathematics.

250
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,790
So this so far, all we've shown
to you is if we do take the

251
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,780
locus of all points that are
equidistant to a point and a

252
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,770
directrix that it
is a parabola.

253
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,570
Now, the interesting
thing to do is let's

254
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,830
say I have a parabola.

255
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,490
Let me give a general form.

256
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,810
And I'll try to use different
letters than I used up here.

257
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,052
So let's say I have a
parabola y minus--

258
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:56,920
let's call it y sub 1.

259
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,070
Where it's just a particular
point on the parabola.

260
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,090
Y minus y sub 1 or you could
call it some constant-- is

261
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:09,585
equal to-- let's call it, I
want to use a capital A just

262
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:12,090
because that tends to be--
I'll use a capital A and just

263
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,340
know that it's different
than this lowercase A.

264
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,960
Some capital A times
x minus x sub 1.

265
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,200
squared.

266
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,140
Whenever you see a y sub 1 or
an x sub 1, that means you're

267
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,770
actually dealing with
a constant term.

268
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,560
If you see just an x or y that
generally means that you're

269
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,770
dealing with a variable term.

270
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,570
So these are constants.

271
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,240
I could have put letters there.

272
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,000
I could have put a and b
there, but then that would've

273
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,070
gotten confused with that.

274
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,970
But let's see if we can relate
these letters because this is

275
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,270
something that we normally see.

276
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,690
And then, we want to find
the focus or the directrix

277
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,870
of a parabola like this.

278
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,950
How can we relate these to
these values right here?

279
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,860
How does k and a and b relate
to these right there?

280
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,810
So let's see if we
can set that up.

281
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,600
So if we just pattern
match that is A.

282
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,250
If we say x sub 1 is lowercase
a, actually that's a straight

283
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,770
up pattern match, so we can
already write that on the side.

284
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,830
x sub 1 is equal to a.

285
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,210
So whatever x value I have
here, this is also the x

286
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,750
value of the focus point.

287
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,210
Which makes sense because in
this case, we already learned

288
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,235
this in previous video.

289
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:15,660
But we learned that the vertex
of this parabola is the

290
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,160
point x sub 1 comma y sub 1.

291
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,370
Anyway, I don't want
to confuse you.

292
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,690
Actually, you know
what I'm going to do?

293
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,980
I don't want to go too far off
into this topic, and I think

294
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,520
this video has already
gotten long enough.

295
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,110
I will continue this
in the next video.

296
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,612
See you soon.

297
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:30,322
