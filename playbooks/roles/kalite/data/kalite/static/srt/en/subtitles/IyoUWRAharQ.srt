1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,070
A lot of people, including myself,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,159
have found the study of World War I

3
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:07,540
to be a little bit confusing sometimes.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,273
And I think the reason is, the world was very different,

5
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:12,674
leading up to World War I, than it is today.

6
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:16,229
The modern world we live in was shaped, to a large degree,

7
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:18,783
by World War I, and then later [by] World War II.

8
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:20,337
And just to get a sense of what

9
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:21,891
our modern world looks like –

10
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:23,446
and especially what modern Europe looks like –

11
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:26,447
this is a map of modern Europe.

12
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:28,852
But the interesting thing about this map is that

13
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:31,120
instead of being the traditional map that you normally see,

14
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:32,850
where you just see the country boundaries –

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,449
the state boundaries – this has the state boundaries

16
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,971
right here in these little gray lines.

17
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:40,830
These show where France ends and, say,

18
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,964
Switzerland or Germany or Italy begins.

19
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:43,245
But overlaying all of that,

20
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:46,295
we see where the languages are spoken.

21
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:47,676
So this is actually much more focused on,

22
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:49,570
[for example], "Where do people speak French?"

23
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:50,440
"Where do people speak German?"

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,205
And the thing that you will notice is – for the most part –

25
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:55,955
throughout most of Europe, today's boundaries –

26
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:59,183
the modern boundaries – closely match up

27
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:01,210
to where languages are spoken.

28
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,342
There are a few areas where there is more of a disconnect

29
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:05,737
[for example,] Catalan and Spanish.

30
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:08,580
(And actually, that is leading to some issues.)

31
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,433
But for the most part, in modern Europe,

32
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,070
the linguistic boundaries and

33
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,140
the national boundaries kind of match up.

34
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,810
If we rewind to the world before World War I,

35
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,430
things were very different.

36
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,869
Some of the boundaries we recognize.

37
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,297
We recognize the United Kingdom.

38
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:31,540
(Well, Ireland has since been carved out.)

39
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,407
But the United Kingdom's boundaries

40
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:35,120
are not very different now than they were then.

41
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,151
Spain is not that different.

42
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:37,567
France is not that different.

43
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,112
Italy is not that different.

44
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:41,317
Germany is a good bit different.

45
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,772
In fact, if you take Germany – or the German Empire –

46
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:47,650
entering into World War I, or in the early 1900s,

47
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,852
before 1914, between it and the Russian Empire,

48
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:54,853
they essentially were swallowing up a bunch of

49
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:58,795
linguistic groups, right over here,

50
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:02,060
that now have their own independent states.

51
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,876
The other thing that you might notice

52
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:07,692
is this huge state called "Austria-Hungary" –

53
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:10,509
often called the "Austro-Hungarian Empire."

54
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,558
And people say, "Well, you know,

55
00:02:12,558 --> 00:02:14,299
I'm familiar with some of these nations

56
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:16,034
that have the words 'Austria' and 'Hungary' in them.

57
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:19,219
But what is this Austro-Hungarian Empire?"

58
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,628
And what's interesting about Austria-Hungary

59
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:21,730
is it really was an empire.

60
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,409
It really was trying to cobble together all of these folks

61
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:26,595
that spoke all [of these] different [languages] –

62
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:29,012
[and that consisted of] all [of these] different types of [ethnicity].

63
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:32,175
This is kind of a zoom-in of the Austro-Hungarian empire

64
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:34,537
leading into World War I.

65
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:37,396
And the Austro-Hungarian Empire is probably

66
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:39,885
the most important empire to focus on if we're trying to

67
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:42,929
understand how World War I started.

68
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,997
Because leading up to World War I, in 1908,

69
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,690
the Austro-Hungarian Empire

70
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,597
formally annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina.

71
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:52,997
And that's another confusing thing for many of us,

72
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:53,622
the fact that 'Bosnia and Herzegovina'

73
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:54,739
is actually the name of just one country.

74
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,350
It's called "Bosnia and Herzegovina."

75
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,553
Or I guess, for the Austro-Hungarians,

76
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,988
that was, I guess now, one region that they annexed.

77
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:05,153
And what's interesting about that is

78
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:06,456
if you look at the linguistic map,

79
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:08,577
you see that this whole region right over here

80
00:03:08,577 --> 00:03:13,046
[speaks] very similar dialects: Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian.

81
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:16,060
They're all very linguistically and ethnically connected.

82
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,660
So this whole region right over here

83
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:24,720
is linguistically and ethnically connected.

84
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:28,080
And what we'll see is that this desire to connect

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,229
ethnic or linguistic backgroundsis what led to a lot of what

86
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:36,809
people with similar happened in World War I –

87
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:39,389
or at least was the spark that [ignited] –

88
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,229
people sometimes say –

89
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,069
the powder keg [that was] World War I.

90
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:44,909
The other thing that was very different –

91
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:48,884
or the other country or nation or empire that we are

92
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:52,859
not [very familiar with] today is the "Ottoman Empire."

93
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,276
So on a modern-day map we would see the country of Turkey –

94
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,693
which is kind of on the Anatolian Peninsula.

95
00:03:57,693 --> 00:04:00,110
So this is Turkey right over here.

96
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,439
This is modern-day Turkey.

97
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,102
But entering into World War I, in 1914,

98
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:06,765
Turkey , essentially, [was formed out of] part of

99
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:09,430
the remnants of the Ottoman Empire.

100
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,000
So, this right over here is what theOttoman Empire looked like.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,918
This, right over here, is roughly modern-day Turkey.

102
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:17,769
The Ottoman Empire contained much of modern-day Turkey,

103
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,027
and much of what we now call the 'Middle East.'

104
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:24,344
including much of what is now Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Israel,

105
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:28,661
and some of what is now Saudi Arabia.

106
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,250
This was then part of the dying Ottoman Empire.

107
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,410
At its peak, the Ottoman Empire controlled much of the Muslim world.

108
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,014
It controlled Northern Africa,

109
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,618
as well as all the stuff that you see here –

110
00:04:42,618 --> 00:04:44,661
and even a little bit of Persia,

111
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,704
and actually a good bit of the Balkans,

112
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,759
Southeast Europe, and even Greece at its peak.

113
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:52,969
Now I'm talking about going hundreds

114
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,124
and hundreds of years back into the past.

115
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,690
So when we enter into World War II,

116
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:59,140
we have a world where state boundaries don't necessarily

117
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:00,960
match linguistic boundaries or by ethnic boundaries.

118
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,000
To a large degree, we had these empires that had existed

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,840
as we exited out of the 1800s.

120
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,404
And these empires were not just in Europe –

121
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:11,968
like the Austro-Hungarian Empire –

122
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:14,533
or not just in the Middle East – like the Ottoman Empire.

123
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:17,755
Right over here is a kind of an empire map

124
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:20,977
at around that point in time.

125
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:23,155
And you see probably the most dominant empire

126
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:25,333
here is the British Empire.

127
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,513
That's [the area in] pink [here].

128
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:29,761
That's the United Kingdom.

129
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:32,009
Great Britain would just be this [island] right over here.

130
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,259
You throw in Ireland, you get the United Kingdom.

131
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,276
Great Britain was in control of

132
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:42,293
the entire Indian subcontinent (in Asia).

133
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:46,310
Although nominally, Egypt was somewhat independent,

134
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,181
Great Britain had a huge amount of influence there.

135
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:52,214
Obviously, places like Canada and Australia

136
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:54,247
and New Zealand were under the control of,

137
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:56,280
or part of, the British Empire.

138
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,729
Well, what a lot of people don't realize is that

139
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:07,300
a significant amount of Africa was also under British control.

140
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,656
And what we have, running up into World War I,

141
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:14,012
is kind of a race between empires –

142
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:16,458
a colonization race especially

143
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,904
between the major powers of Europe.

144
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:21,350
In particular, you have Great Britain – or or the United Kingdom –

145
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,020
that obviously had a vast empire.

146
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,780
"The sun never sets on the British Empire."

147
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,919
And it wasn't ever setting on this empire that we just saw here.

148
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,191
And the German Empire was also startingto flex its muscle and starting to militarize.

149
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,419
And the more that the Germans saw that the British were militarizing,

150
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:41,984
the more the Germans would want to militarize – and vice versa.

151
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,160
And you just had this arms race.

152
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,340
And they were all trying to build their empires.

153
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,580
So the Germans, they were present in Africa.

154
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,949
You have the French who were present in much of Africa.

155
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,565
And you have to remember all of this in context.

156
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:56,367
Some of this empire building was, frankly, just about you ego,

157
00:06:56,367 --> 00:07:01,210
and just about spreading someone's influence – spreading [one's] power.

158
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,421
A lot of it was based on kind of ethnic beliefs about civilization.

159
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:10,410
I guess these were rationalizations to [justify taking] control of other people's resources.

160
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,599
And a lot of it was – we were in a world where access to resources,

161
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,680
in particular access to raw materials – and especially oil –
