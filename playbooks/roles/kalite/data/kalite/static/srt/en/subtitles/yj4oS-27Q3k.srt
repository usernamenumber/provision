1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,022
In this video I'm going to talk a little more about points on

2
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:07,074
angle bisector but before that I want to at least make sure we

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,840
understand what we mean when we talk about the distance

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,923
between a point and a line.

5
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:16,524
So say that that is some point, point A

6
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:19,923
this is some line right over here, we'll call that line,

7
00:00:19,923 --> 00:00:23,239
BC, so when you're taking the distance between

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,491
a point and another point, it's very obvious,

9
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:28,291
you just draw a line to that other point,

10
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,940
Well I already used B, you just draw a line to that other point

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,307
and you find the length of that line,

12
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:35,459
so distance seems very straight foreward between

13
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:37,441
two points, but what about a point and a line

14
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:40,041
because there are many points on this line

15
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:45,358
maybe were going to find this distance, or maybe were going to find this distance, or this distance,

16
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:48,091
and these are all going to be different lengths

17
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,941
so how do we have one unique distance?

18
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:52,657
And the way that we think about this, and we're going

19
00:00:52,657 --> 00:00:54,724
to do this in much more depth in future math courses

20
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:57,408
especially when you start vectors and linear algebra

21
00:00:57,408 --> 00:01:00,139
and all the rest, is distance between a point and a line is

22
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:03,524
really the shortest distance and that shortest distance

23
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:05,091
is as if you were to drop a

24
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:08,925
perpendicular from that point to the line, so this right over here,

25
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:12,159
this right over here, is what we call the distance

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,692
the distance between the point and the line, and this

27
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,293
is perpendicular right over here, to

28
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:20,676
recognize that this is indeed the shortest distance

29
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:23,859
think about this relative -the distance between this point

30
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:28,109
and any other point on this line. so pick another

31
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,807
point on this line right over here, let's call this

32
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:36,126
point E, and think about this --now this is an

33
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:38,025
arbitrary point I could have drawn E here,

34
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:39,710
I could have drawn E here, I could have drawn E anywhere,

35
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,676
but regardless of where you draw E, if you

36
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:44,697
draw a line segment between A and E, you see that

37
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:47,710
we've form a right triangle from A to E, to the

38
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,660
point we had the perpendicular, so let me call this

39
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,044
point right here F, you're always going to draw

40
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:57,659
a right triangle assuming that E is different than F

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,210
and if you will immediately see that you see that D

42
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,593
has to be shorter than this orange length, because this

43
00:02:02,593 --> 00:02:05,309
orange length is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse

44
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,943
is always going to be the longest side a triangle

45
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:10,778
D squared plus whatever length this squared, is

46
00:02:10,778 --> 00:02:14,044
going to be equal to this length squared. So hopefully

47
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:16,894
that at least gives you a decent sense why dropping

48
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:20,728
the perpendicular will always give you the shortest

49
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:22,978
distance between a point and a line, and that unique

50
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:25,978
shortest distance is what we call the distance

51
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:28,493
between a point and a line. Now with that out of the way,

52
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:31,393
let's think a little bit about angle bisectors.

53
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:38,328
So let me draw an angle here, so let me, draw an angle.

54
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:42,462
So lets call this point, let me do it in a different color,

55
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,759
let's call that point A, lets call this point B,

56
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,662
and let's call this point C right over here.

57
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:50,544
And an angle bisector is essentially line, or a segment,

58
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:53,928
or a ray that splits an angle into two equal angles

59
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,312
and we've talked about this before,

60
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:59,545
so for example if we want to bisect angle ABC,

61
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:01,761
so this angle right over here, we want to split it

62
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:05,962
in two, we are going to -I can draw a better version

63
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:09,244
of that, we want to split it in two, we want to split it in two

64
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:13,394
like, let me draw a little bit better, my drawing

65
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:17,846
still doesn't look like, that looks decent, alright,

66
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:23,345
so lets call this point right over here D,

67
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:25,844
and again we could even say that, that's a ray,

68
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:27,728
or we could call that a segment, or whatever,

69
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:29,830
but the way to think about this, is if now

70
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,496
angle DBC is equal to angle DBA, so this angle,

71
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:43,963
DBC is equal to angle DBA, we can say that DB bisects

72
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:49,963
angle ABC, so we can say that DB and now Im talking

73
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,562
about segment DB we could have made it a ray if we

74
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:54,895
had -keep going to the right, or a line. DB

75
00:03:54,895 --> 00:04:02,880
bisects BISECTS angle ABC, ABC

76
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,247
Fare enough, now, the whole reason why I started

77
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:08,814
this video talking about distances between points and lines,

78
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,614
is that I want to show you, that any point that is on

79
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:12,780
an angle bisector, is actually going to be

80
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,352
equidistant from the sides of the angle, and then were

81
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:18,362
going to go the other way saying, any point

82
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:20,998
that is equidistant from the sides of an angle is

83
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:24,203
going on the angle bisector. So lets take an

84
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:26,570
arbitrary point that sits on this angle bisector

85
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,903
so let's take this point right over here,

86
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,453
Ill call that arbitrary point F, or actually I havnt used

87
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:36,686
E yet, so this is going to be and arbitrary point on our

88
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:40,820
angle bisector, and now let's look at the distance between

89
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,436
E and BC and the distance between E and BA we already

90
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:46,922
say that, -we already said that the distance between

91
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:49,388
point and a line is if you drop a perpendicular

92
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:51,788
from a point to that line, which you can always do

93
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:54,754
so lets draw a perpendicular right over here,

94
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,904
this is one distance, and then this is the other distance

95
00:04:57,904 --> 00:05:04,238
this is, -this orange line right here is the distance between E and BC and this orange line is the distance

96
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:11,721
between E and BA and what I want to prove is that these distances are equal

97
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:17,372
well the first thing to realize, is that we have two right triangles over here, they both share

98
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:24,239
th- they both have the same angle, they're not sharing it but angle ABE is congruent

99
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:29,788
to angle CBE and we know that because DB bisects it so this angle is equal to that angle

100
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:34,372
they're both right triangles so the actually have 2 angles in common, which actually means

101
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:38,605
they actually have 3 angles in common and constrains what this other angle would be and they also have

102
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:44,039
this side in common, -they have 3 angles are congruent to each other, they are not

103
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,256
necessarily in common, but it does have this side in common, BE is the hypotenuse

104
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:52,240
of both of these right triangles, and so, you can invoke

105
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,990
using this angle, that angle and this side, this angle,that angle and this side

106
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,554
you could say that these 2 triangles are going to be congruent to each other

107
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:04,855
so we could say that triangle, and let me put some points over here, so let's see

108
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:14,007
let's call this F and let's call this G, we can say that triangle EBF is congruent to triangle

109
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:23,656
EBG and we can use AAS, by Angle Angle Side congruency or you could say hey if

110
00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:28,223
two angles, -if corresponding angles are the same then the third angle is also going to be the same

111
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:31,925
so this angle right over here could also be the same and

112
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,307
you could use ASA, but either way these two things are going to be congruent

113
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:39,290
but if these two things are congruent, then the corresponding sides are going to be congruent

114
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:47,774
so then, then length of EF, segment EF, is going to be congruent to segment

115
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,191
EF is going to be congruent to segment EG which is the same

116
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:57,224
thing as the length of EF is equal to the length of EG, these are really, these are really

117
00:06:57,224 --> 00:07:02,940
equivalent statements right over there, so the length of EF, the length of EF

118
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,575
is equal to the length of EG and the length of those two segments are the distances

119
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:09,893
between the point and those 2 respective sides.

120
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:15,443
We've just proven the first case, if a point lies on an angle bisector, it is

121
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:21,608
equidistant from the 2 sides of the angle, now let's go the other way around,

122
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:29,025
let's say that I have, so let me draw another angle here, so let me draw another angle over here and let's call

123
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:40,142
this A, B, and C and let's pick some arbitrary point E, let's point some arbitrary point E

124
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:43,929
right over here and let's say we start off with the assumption that E is equidistant

125
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:51,793
to BC and BA and what we want to do is prove that E must be on the angle bisector,

126
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:55,959
so here, if you're on the angle bisector you're equidistant, over here we're going to show if you're

127
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:02,059
equidistant you're on the angle bisector, so if it's equidistant to BC and BA, then this perpendicular

128
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:06,524
right over here, this perpendicular right over here, is going to be congruent to this

129
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:13,909
perpendicular right over there, and let me give these points' labels, so let call this point D, and let's

130
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:20,909
call this point right over F, and let's just draw segment BE here, let's just draw segment

131
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:29,577
BE right over here, so once again, we have 2 right triangles, we already know that

132
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:32,511
2 of the legs are congruent to each other, they both share the hypotenuse this

133
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,493
hypotenuse is equal to its self, we know from the pythagorean theorm

134
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:43,210
if you know 2 sides of a triangle, it determines the third side, so and we know 2 sides of both

135
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:48,694
of these, so the third sides must be the same, so this side must be equal to that side

136
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:53,495
so you could invoke SSS, Side Side Side, to show these 2 triangles are congruent

137
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:56,944
or you actually didn't need to -have to good there you could have used a special

138
00:08:56,944 --> 00:09:02,985
case, the RSH case, where if you have a right triangle, so if you have the right triangle

139
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:06,012
you have one set of sides that are congruent, and you have the hypotenuse that is congruent

140
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:11,419
then you're also okay, you could use RSH to prove congruency as well,

141
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:21,742
and so either way we know that triangle EBD, triangle EBD, is congruent to triangle EBF

142
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:29,135
congruent to triangle EBF, we used Side Side Side here but you could have used RSH, let me write that

143
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:34,903
RSH, which is -we know that Angle Side Side can be used for any general triangle

144
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:38,719
but it can be, -RSH is essentially Angle Side Side for right triangles, if you have

145
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:49,669
2 sides of a right triangle and- in common, --if 2 sides of a right triangle are congruent then

146
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:57,036
the 2 triangles are definitely congruent but once you know that two triangles are congruent, then

147
00:09:57,036 --> 00:10:01,970
they're corresponding angles have to be congruent, and angle EBD, angle EBD

148
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:11,636
corresponds to angle EBF so we know that angle EBD must be congruent to angle EBF

149
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:21,854
so EBD must be congruent to EBF, well if EBD is congruent to EBF then that means

150
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:38,086
that segment EB must bisect, must bisect angle CBF, or actually CBA even, it could be called CEF

151
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:43,804
angle CBA. So we're done! If over here, we show that if something sits on a bisector is

152
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:48,021
equidistant from the sides of the angle, and here we showed if it's equidistant from the sides

153
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:54,470
of the angle it sits on the angle bisector, or, or -it could even be the end point of an angle bisector

154
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,815
but clearly, it sits on it.
