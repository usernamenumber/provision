1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,831
You've probably heard the word "parsec" before

2
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:09,149
in science fiction movies or maybe even in some things dealing with astronomy.

3
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:10,820
And what I want to do with this video is really just tell you

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,325
where this, where the word and the definition of the word really come from

5
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:16,718
and just to kind of cut to the chase.

6
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:18,065
It's just a unit of distance.

7
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:24,467
It's just about 3.26... 3.26 light years.

8
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:27,725
What I want to do is think about where did this weird distance come from,

9
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:30,650
this distance that is roughly 3.26 light years?

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,000
It comes from... it comes from the distance...

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,056
the distance of something...

12
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:42,307
of something, probably a star, but let me say "something"

13
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:45,533
because there are no stars exactly this far away from us.

14
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:49,319
The distance of something whose parallax, or let me say

15
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:58,700
that has... that has... a parallax... parallax... angle

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:06,038
of... one arc... one arc second, and the word

17
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:12,168
comes from the "par" in parallax and the second is "arc second".

18
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:15,976
So it's literally "par"... I'm going to do this in a different color...

19
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:19,133
It's literally "parsec".

20
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,384
You can think of this as a kind of a parallax... parallax arc second.

21
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:23,824
How far would this thing be?

22
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:26,378
It turns out it's 3.26 light years.

23
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,333
So we can actually calculate that, that's essentially what I'm going to do with this video.

24
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,394
So let's say there is something...

25
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:34,552
let's say... so this is the sun,

26
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:39,056
this is the earth at some point in time,

27
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:43,375
this is the earth six months later at the opposite end of the orbit.

28
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,744
And we are looking at some distance,

29
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:50,434
we're looking at some object, some distance away.

30
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:54,056
We know that this distance right here is 1 astronmical unit,

31
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:59,072
and what we want to do is to figure out the distance of this object.

32
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:03,716
And all we know is that it has a parallax angle of 1 arc second.

33
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:05,620
So let's remind ourselves of what this means.

34
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,333
If we are looking right at, right at, remember we're looking from above the solar system,

35
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,722
so the earth is rotating in this direction, in either case,

36
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:18,716
and so in this point in the year, we don't know when this is,

37
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:20,295
depends on what star that is,

38
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:24,149
at this point in the year, right at sunrise,

39
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:28,050
right when we first catch the first glimpses of the sun's light,

40
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,258
if we look straight up, if we look straight up,

41
00:02:31,258 --> 00:02:35,899
the angle, the angle between that object in the night sky

42
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,537
and straight up

43
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:39,696
is going to be the parallax angle.

44
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:45,533
So this is going to be 1, this is going to be 1 arc, arc second.

45
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:48,995
And just to make it consistent with the last few videos we did on parallax,

46
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:52,478
let's just visualize how that would look in the night sky.

47
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:56,400
So let me draw the night sky over here,

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,958
we'll do that in purple maybe

49
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,719
Let me draw the night sky over here.

50
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,391
This is looking straight up.

51
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:07,431
This is north, south, west, and east.

52
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:12,819
And so you can imagine in this situation, the sun is just rising on the east...

53
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,301
The sun is just rising on the east.

54
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,123
Let me make it the color of the sun.

55
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:20,574
The sun is just rising on the east.

56
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:22,989
And so this will be towards the direction of the sun.

57
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,379
You could imagine that to some degree... well, this is north.

58
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:30,048
North is the top of the earth right here, kind of pointed towards us, out of the screen.

59
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:31,905
South is going into the screen.

60
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:33,391
Hopefully, that helps with the visualization.

61
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:38,533
Or another way to think about it, the sun is rising in the east.

62
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:42,401
This is going to be towards the direction of the sun, of a certain angle from the center.

63
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:44,073
In this case, it's 1 arc second.

64
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:46,162
So, it's going to be right over here.

65
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:51,642
So this, this angle right over here is going to be 1 arc second.

66
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:56,379
And then if we were to see where that object is six months later, it'll be the opposite.

67
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:01,000
We're going to be looking, we're going to be looking in the same... the center of the universe.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,484
Or I should say the center of the night sky at that point.

69
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:05,388
The same direction of the universe.

70
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:08,314
The universe actually has no center. We've talked about that many times.

71
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:12,401
If we look at the same direction of the night sky, we'll be looking six months later,

72
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:15,048
and instead of it being at dawn, it will now be at sunset.

73
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:18,717
We'll be just getting the last glimpses of the sun.

74
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:22,267
And so the sun will be setting...

75
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:24,382
the sun will be setting in the west.

76
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:26,379
The sun will be setting in the west.

77
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:31,867
And so this angle, this angle right here, which is also the same thing as a paralax angle,

78
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:35,389
it'll be... this will also be 1 arc second.

79
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,478
So this will also be 1 arc second.

80
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,172
1 arc second.

81
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:43,283
So let's figure out how far this object is.

82
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:49,367
What is... what is an actual parsec in terms of astronomical units or light years.

83
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:53,498
So if this is 1 arc second, this is going to be...

84
00:04:53,498 --> 00:04:59,441
and remember, 1 arc second is equal to one-thirty-six-hundreth (1/3600) of a degree.

85
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:00,917
1/3600th of a degree.

86
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:09,243
So this angle, right over here, is going to be 90-1/3600th.

87
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,890
And we just use a little bit of trigonometry.

88
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,398
The tangent of this angle.

89
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:24,383
The tangent of 90-1/3600 is going to be this distance in astronomical units divided by 1.

90
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:26,705
Well, you divide anything by 1, it's just going to be that distance.

91
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:29,467
So that's the distance right over there.

92
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:35,389
So we get our calculator out, and we want to find the tangent...

93
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:47,696
the tangent of 90-1/3600, and we will get our distance in astronomical units.

94
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:51,333
206,264.

95
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,547
We're going to say 265.

96
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:54,708
So this is going to be equal to...

97
00:05:54,708 --> 00:06:02,267
This distance over here is going to be equal to 206,265. I'm just rounding, astronomical units.

98
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:08,176
And if we want to convert that into light years, we just divide.

99
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:14,073
So there are 63,150 light years per astronomical unit...

100
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,721
I'm sorry, astronomical units per light year.

101
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:19,043
So this is... let me actually right it down.

102
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:22,711
Just so you make it... I don't want to confuse you with the unit cancellation.

103
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:30,049
So we're dealing with 206,265 astronomical units,

104
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:38,362
and we want to multiply that times 1 light year is equal to 63,115 astronomical units.

105
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:41,705
And we want this in the numerator and the denominator to cancel out.

106
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:48,000
And so if you divide 206,265, this number up here,

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,501
divided by 63,115, the number of astronomical units in a light year,

108
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:57,030
63,115... let me delete that right over there,

109
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,071
we get 3.2 or the way, the way the math worked out here,

110
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:03,300
round to 3.27 light years.

111
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:11,102
So this is equal to... this is equal to roughly 3.27 light years.

112
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:13,052
So I should just show it's approximate right over there.

113
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:14,956
But that's where the parsec comes from.

114
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:17,371
So hopefully, you now you just realize it is just a distance.

115
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,065
But even more, you understand where it comes from.

116
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:24,291
It's the distance that an object needs to be from earth

117
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,284
in order for it to have a paralax angle of 1 arc second.

118
00:07:28,284 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's where the word came from. Paralax. Arc second.
