1
00:00:01,691 --> 00:00:08,191
Newton´s 3rd Law tells us that to every action there is always a equal and opposite reaction.

2
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:12,224
When I´m shooting the ball I´m clearly applying force to it.

3
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:16,890
Where is the equal and opposite reaction?

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,722
That´s a excellent question LeBron.

5
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:23,290
So as you mention if someone shooting a ball there clearly applying force to that ball.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,469
Let me see if I can draw that for you. Let´s say that this is the force

7
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:29,979
that your hand is applying on the ball.

8
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:34,201
And this force is what accelerate the ball upwards and towards the basket.

9
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:43,531
So forces applied by hand on the ball.

10
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:49,454
So where is this equal and opposite force that´s Newton´s 3rd Law tells us about?

11
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:54,191
That´s going to be the force that the ball is applying to your hand.

12
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:59,239
So I will draw the force right here, I can drawn anywhere on the hand but I draw it right here,

13
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:03,165
just you can see the exact opposite direction. It´s going to be the exact opposite direction.

14
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:05,369
And it has a equal magnitude.

15
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,868
So it´s a equal, but opposite force. Opposite is the direction, so just like that.

16
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:25,702
So that is the force apllied by the ball on your hand.

17
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:28,448
Then you might say that this doesn´t make a lot of sense.

18
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:31,865
The ball is clearly getting accelerated in that direction

19
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:37,236
but my hand isn´t accelerating backwards in kind of that opposite direction.

20
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:41,426
And the reason why your hand isn´t accelerating backwards, isn´t just flopping backwards,

21
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:44,425
because of this force of the ball applying on the hand.

22
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:49,342
The reason is because of your hand or your fingers had other forces acting on it.

23
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,662
They´re counting on act this force.

24
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:55,957
So for example, the reason why your fingers and your hand don´t flop backwards,

25
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:58,287
don´t accelerated backwards because of the force,

26
00:01:58,287 --> 00:02:01,176
is because you have muscles in your forearm.

27
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:04,593
You have muscles in your forearm ruffled right there

28
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:10,581
that are pulling on your fingers and your hand and they´re underacting this force.

29
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:16,138
So ok fair enough, I can see why the fingers are not flopping back,

30
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:20,381
my hand doesn´t flopping back it is because of these muscles right over here.

31
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:26,757
Why is that my entire forearm being pushed or accelerated back by this force applied by the ball on my hand?

32
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:34,719
And the reason is its you have other muscles in the back of your upper arm, particularly your triceps,

33
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,063
that are keeping, that are tagging on your forearm

34
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:44,099
it´s contracting, they are contracting,

35
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:50,017
that more then offset any net forces on your forearm that would make it go that way,

36
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:51,414
it´s pulling on your forearm

37
00:02:51,414 --> 00:02:57,128
and in the fact that what´s contracting on your forearm to go in actually that direction.

38
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:03,876
We can keep going, i mean the fun or the complicated thing about Newton´s 3rd Law is that every force has the equal opposite force.

39
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:06,325
Well everyone of these have equal and opposite force

40
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:13,301
and we can keep going on, as ok there is equal and opposite force of the triceps tagging on the forearm.

41
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,298
Well that´s the forearm tagging on the triceps.

42
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:16,466
Why is not the triceps move?

43
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:18,720
Well the triceps is attached to the other parts of your body.

44
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,672
We can keep going on and on and on.

45
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:22,475
But just to focus on a question.

46
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:25,416
Your hand is definitely applying force to the ball,

47
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:30,254
but the equal and opposite force is the force that the ball is applying to the hand.

48
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:35,350
But we actually even when we said that your hand isn´t flopping back because of being balance

49
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,473
you actually can sense this force.

50
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:39,642
And the reason why you do sense this force is

51
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:44,661
you actually do have the ball compressing against the palm of your hand.

52
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:47,032
And if you didn´t do that you wouldn´t even feel the ball.

53
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:51,969
So that gives you at least the sensory clue of Newton´s 3rd Law.

54
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:55,277
If Newton´s 3rd Law wasn´t true you wouldn´t even feel the ball,

55
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:59,277
you wouldn´t even have the ball compressed against the skin of your palm.
