1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330
   

2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,660
In the last video, we got an
overview of electrotonic

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,780
potentials and action potentials
and how they

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,160
essentially can transmit
potential differences through

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,950
a cell or how they can
move a potential

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,850
difference through a cell.

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,910
And just as a bit of review,
electrotonic is if you have

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,310
some type of charge disruption--
let's say a

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,180
sodium gate opens and a bunch of
positive ions flow in, that

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,810
very quickly is going to
make things nearby

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,130
more positive, right?

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,259
It's very quickly because the
positive charges are going to

13
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,330
move away from their
positive brethren.

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,940
Positives and positives
repel each other.

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,830
And so if we go some point
further off in the cell--

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,490
let's say we were looking at
that point right here-- the

17
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,890
positive charges-- if there's
a positive charge here, it's

18
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,590
going to want to move
in that direction.

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,876
If you have a positive charge
here, it's going to move in

20
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:48,360
this direction.

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,230
So it's going to become more
positive very quickly.

22
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,760
So that's what we talk about
electrotonic potential.

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,260
And the benefit is, it happens
very, very quickly.

24
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,960
If we're looking at this
point, as soon as these

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,350
positive charges move in, a
positive charge here that's

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,200
right there is going to want to
move there and a positive

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,550
charge that's here is going to
want to move to the right, but

28
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,010
not as quickly because the the
effect gets diffused, right?

29
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,560
The impact on this charge is
less than this charge because

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,460
it's further away.

31
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,830
And we could think more, we
could run computer simulations

32
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,090
about it, but I think you
get the general idea.

33
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,480
Positive things flow in.

34
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,390
Other positive things
want to move away.

35
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,590
That makes any point that's some
distance away from that

36
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,370
disruption a little bit more
positive so it'll affect its

37
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,010
voltage almost immediately.

38
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,150
So it's very fast, but
the problem is it

39
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,260
dissipates with distance.

40
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,300
If we go really far from that--
if we went all the way

41
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,340
down here, this guy would have
almost no impact from what's

42
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,100
happening at this opening
of this sodium gate.

43
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,480
So that's its negative.

44
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,880
On the other hand, on the other
side of the spectrum, we

45
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,640
looked at action potentials.

46
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,330
Action potentials
are all about--

47
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,650
you have some stimulus.

48
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,810
In general, it's getting a
little bit of a positive

49
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,540
charge near a sodium gate.

50
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,310
So normally, we're resting
at minus 70 millvolts.

51
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,590
Maybe you have a little bit of
a positive charge come, maybe

52
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,520
through some type of
electrotonic interaction, but

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,240
that's not enough.

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,770
But maybe another one comes by
and it gets you to minus 55

55
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,500
millvolts and then the gate
opens, sodium floods in, we

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,590
become much more positive.

57
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,840
Then the sodium gates close.

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Potassium gates open.

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,820
The potassium wants to flow out
of the cell because we're

60
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,930
positive in the cell now and
there's a lot of potassium on

61
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,400
the inside because of the
sodium potassium pumps.

62
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,760
So then we go back
to negative.

63
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,470
We actually overshoot.

64
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,050
And just in case you want to
know, at this point, we're

65
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,630
kind of in this refractory
period.

66
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,860
And the original gate that just
opened and closed-- it's

67
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,600
deactivated for a short
period of time.

68
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,540
So there's some period of time
that another stimulus won't be

69
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,995
able to do it, but then our
sodium potassium pumps can get

70
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:43,790
us back to normal.

71
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,370
But the whole time that that
was happening, as the gate

72
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,540
that was to the left got all
charged up, as the sodium

73
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,540
started flowing in, it's
obviously going to make it a

74
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,290
little bit more positive to the
gate that's directly to

75
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,160
the right of it.

76
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,080
So the gate that's to the right
of it, its charge is

77
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,990
going to go slightly up and
then bam, it hits its

78
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,280
threshold for firing.

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,490
So then that sodium gate opens
and the same thing happens a

80
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,590
little bit further
to the right.

81
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,130
And I could keep doing that,
maybe even a little bit

82
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,120
further to right.

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,790
A gate's potential might look
something like that and that's

84
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,550
how it travels.

85
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,810
Now the benefit of this is that
the signal never loses

86
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,950
strength, right?

87
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,030
We can just keep going down
the cell like this.

88
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,870
We could do that for millions
of miles if we had to.

89
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,620
The negative is that it's slower
than electrotonic in

90
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,120
that you have to open and close
these gates and it also

91
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,690
requires energy because you're
always having to re-balance

92
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,920
the charge potential between
the inside and the

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,800
outside of the cell.

94
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,400
So we need to think about, how
could a cell use both of these

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,380
things to optimize those
tradeoffs between signal

96
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,320
dissipation and speed?

97
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,120
And this is exactly what
the neuron does do.

98
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,930
So let's go back.

99
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,470
Now we're ready to close the
loop and actually talk about

100
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,400
the neuron.

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,670
So when I talked about a neuron
getting excited on the

102
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,320
dendrite-- if I zoom in on a
dendrite-- let's say this is a

103
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,340
dendrite's membrane
right here.

104
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,450
Let me zoom in on a dendrite.

105
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,720
So that's the dendrite
right there.

106
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,860
Let's say that this
is a drawing of

107
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,070
that point right there.

108
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,100
When I say stimulated, what's
happening is, some channel is

109
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,709
being triggered, some gate
is being opened.

110
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,770
And so let's say that this is
a sodium channel and it

111
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,430
stimulates-- the stimulus, it
could be-- like in our action

112
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,800
potential-- it could
be voltage gated.

113
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,810
A higher voltage might
cause it to happen.

114
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,310
It might be some chemical
stimulus from some other

115
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,850
terminal end of some
other axon.

116
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,595
It could be pressure.

117
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:37,100
It could be, who knows?

118
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,340
It could be some molecule that
stimulates it, but something

119
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,490
is making a gate open and maybe
it's a sodium gate and

120
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,350
so positive charge is going
to flood in here.

121
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,770
Positive charge is going
to flow into the cell.

122
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,900
We know why it does that.

123
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,430
There's a lot of sodium
on the outside.

124
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,260
That's what the sodium
potassium pump does.

125
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,660
So positive charge flows
into the cell.

126
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,890
So immediately, it's going
to have some impact.

127
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,570
If we measure the voltage here,
immediately the positive

128
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,310
charge here is going to want
to travel away and so this

129
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,400
point is going to become a
little bit more positive.

130
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,870
If we look at this point, it's
going to become a little bit

131
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,880
more positive, but it's so far
away from the original

132
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,070
reaction that maybe it doesn't
become as positive because the

133
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,670
ions are becoming dissipated
as we go through the cell.

134
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,240
So as we go right here
to our axon hillock,

135
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,640
we have more gates.

136
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,520
Let's say that that's
a sodium gate.

137
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,950
Let's say that this is
a potassium gate.

138
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,720
Let's say that we have
another sodium gate.

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,940
Doesn't have to be configured
this way.

140
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,870
We have another potassium
gate right there.

141
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,070
Now if we just had one event
here, we're so far away from

142
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,470
that event that maybe if we
measured the potential at that

143
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,860
point, at the axon hillock--
remember, that's the little

144
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,430
bulge that turns
into the axon.

145
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,380
Let's do that same chart that
I had before, where we have

146
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,150
membrane potential.

147
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,380
So potential across
the membrane.

148
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,120
And then we have time.

149
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,190
So if we look at this point--
let's say we're looking at

150
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,350
this point right here, that
point and we're comparing it

151
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,120
to the outside of
the membrane.

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,540
So it's starting at minus
70 millivolts.

153
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,620
That's its resting.

154
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,930
And let's say that some event
happened out here and

155
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,920
electrotonically it's going to
increase the potential a

156
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,810
little bit because positive
charge is going to make its

157
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,300
way and they're all going
to push each other.

158
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,070
They're all going to get away
from each other and this one's

159
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,000
going to become slightly
positive.

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,620
But let's say it only goes to
minus 65, nothing happens.

161
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,730
Then your sodium potassium
pumps come into effect so

162
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,850
nothing really happened.

163
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,300
It didn't trigger the neuron,
but let's say that gets

164
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,350
stimulated again and let's say
there's a couple more that get

165
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,570
stimulated and their combined
effects-- because all of them

166
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,870
are flooding with positive
ions now-- their combined

167
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,420
effects are enough to get this
point to the threshold.

168
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,150
So they're enough to get
this point to minus 55.

169
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,900
And we know what's going
to happen here.

170
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,910
As soon as this sodium gate gets
to minus 55, it's going

171
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,230
to open up.

172
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,770
It's going to open up and sodium
is going to flood in.

173
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,730
Sodium is going to flood in
until we get to positive 40.

174
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,260
then it's going to close.

175
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,580
Then the potassium gate's going
to open and get us back

176
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,040
to where we were before.

177
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,250
We're going to overshoot a
little bit and then our sodium

178
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,520
potassium pump's going to get
back to where we wanted.

179
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,350
That's going to happen there,
but as the sodium is floating

180
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,500
in into that first gate, this
guy's going to become positive

181
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,620
here and then this gate, this
sodium gate, is going to

182
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,340
become triggered.

183
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,470
And this is that action
potential idea.

184
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,540
Now, we could just keep going
our action potential all the

185
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,210
way down the axon because we
said the benefit of the

186
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,110
electrotonic is that it goes
fast, but doesn't cover a lot

187
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,540
of distance.

188
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,860
This is a relatively short
distance, while the axon is

189
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,570
super-long.

190
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,670
So you might say, OK, I see,
electrotonic from the dendrite

191
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,310
to the axon hillock-- and then
we use action potential all

192
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,140
the way down the axon.

193
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,390
That would be reasonable because
we're not going to

194
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,450
lose our signal strength.

195
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,120
We would keep having that
domino, that chain reaction

196
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,410
going all the way until we get
to our terminal end, but the

197
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,570
problem there is, it's slow.

198
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,250
I mean, if this is a five foot
long axon, I don't want to

199
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,230
have a slow signal.

200
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,530
If someone just bit me, I
want to move my hand.

201
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,570
If I just touched a stove, I
want to move my hand quickly.

202
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,040
I don't want all that signal
to take so much time, all

203
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,580
these gates to open and close
along the whole four or five

204
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,970
feet-- of if I'm a dinosaur,
move my arm.

205
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,770
It needs to happen quickly.

206
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,495
So what happens is that
there's a combination.

207
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:31,900
   

208
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,350
You get your signal and this
amplifies the signal.

209
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,200
The signal is very
weak here, right?

210
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,140
It only got us to minus 55,
but then when that first

211
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,080
sodium gate opens, it creates a
huge positive potential that

212
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,965
opens the next gate.

213
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:46,640
So we have a huge positive
potential here.

214
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,300
Now the axons have these
huge spaces where

215
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,370
they're covered up.

216
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,590
They're covered up by these
Schwann cells or by these

217
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,740
myelin sheaths.

218
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,090
So even if there are
gates underneath

219
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,500
them, they're useless.

220
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,460
They can't interface with
the outside sodiums and

221
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,990
potassiums. So over this
distance of the axon, you

222
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,860
cannot have a straight-up
action potential.

223
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,270
What happened is, your action
potential here, it made

224
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,510
everything a lot more positive
than it would have been had

225
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,480
there not been that opening of
the gate and now you can have

226
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,690
an electrotonic effect again.

227
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,490
So you kind of boosted
your signal.

228
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,590
So now this might
get to plus 40.

229
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,170
Maybe over here we only get to
minus 50, but minus 50, once

230
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,940
again is enough to trigger a
sodium gate, which then makes

231
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,540
everything really
positive again.

232
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,260
It boosts the signal.

233
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,940
It makes everything positive
again, then your potassium

234
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,570
gates, everything, comes
out of the cell again.

235
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,320
So everything gets back
to normal, but

236
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,260
it boosted the signal.

237
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,630
Now electrotonically, this
is super positive.

238
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,610
Now the electrotonic effect,
if we go some distance down

239
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,280
the axon, this'll be less
positive, but it'll be just

240
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,170
enough to trigger another
action potential.

241
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,760
And then that happens again.

242
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,490
So we have this combination
of action potentials with

243
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,380
electrotonics.

244
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,920
So electrotonic-- this is very
fast. This is a fast

245
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,350
interaction.

246
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,440
It happens immediately,
but it dissipates

247
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,360
as it covers distance.

248
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,200
So we can't have these nodes
of Ranvier being super far

249
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,060
from each other.

250
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,910
They have to be just far enough
so that when one action

251
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,430
potential happens, that
it's still enough to

252
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,520
trigger the next one.

253
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,440
It's not going to boost its
potential to plus 40, but as

254
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,530
long as it boosts it to minus
55, we're still going to

255
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,970
produce a signal to
keep moving on.

256
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,640
So this is a really good
tradeoff because we get fast,

257
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,460
slow, but it boosts
the signal.

258
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,190
Fast signal dies down, but it's
enough to essentially

259
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,640
trigger this guy and then
it boosts the signal.

260
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,240
It's slow, but then we
travel fast again.

261
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,350
Signal dies, boosts the signal
slow, and we keep traveling

262
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,670
that way down the axon.

263
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,830
And this is actually called
a saltatory conduction.

264
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,270
Let me write this down.

265
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,600
   

266
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,710
Saltatory conduction, which
I think comes from

267
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,100
the Latin for hopping.

268
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,170
I remember when I first learned
this in biology class,

269
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,800
they kind of talked about it.

270
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,170
Somehow putting the myelin
sheath there just magically

271
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,180
made it happen faster and these
things just hop from one

272
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,950
action potential reaction
to another, but

273
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,210
that's not what's happening.

274
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,900
You're boosting the signal here
with an action potential.

275
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,020
When these gates open, it
becomes super positive.

276
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,770
When it becomes super positive
here-- from a maybe not so

277
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,460
positive trigger becomes super
positive, that allows this

278
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,780
point to become reasonably
positive, enough to trigger

279
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,030
the next reaction.

280
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,050
When that triggers, then it
becomes super positive, makes

281
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,420
this reasonably positive
or less negative, it

282
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,400
triggers the next one.

283
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,600
So it's a combination of action
potentials that boosts

284
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,300
the signal.

285
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,270
And electrotonic effects that
move the signal, that gives us

286
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,540
this saltatory conduction.

287
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,650
So that's actually how neurons
are able to make that tradeoff

288
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,310
between traveling huge
distances, but not losing

289
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,910
their signal.

290
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,155
