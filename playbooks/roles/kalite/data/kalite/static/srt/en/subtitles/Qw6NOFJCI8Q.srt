1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,910
A fundamental role of a museum is to care for
its collection and preserve it for future generations.

2
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:16,289
European drawings from the 1300s
to the late 1800s

3
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,580
-or old master drawings-

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,779
are particularly vulnerable-

5
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:22,250
they are on paper

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,169
and hundreds of years old.

7
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:28,269
Conserving an old master drawing

8
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:30,199
is a balancing act.

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,420
All drawings have their own set of condition issues

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,700
that need to be assessed individually.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,700
Here, a Getty Conservator carefully examines
a 500-year old German drawing.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,480
She first removes the drawing from its mount
(or support).

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,700
She inspects the drawing lit from below.

14
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,460
This makes it easier to see the marks left
by the wires of the paper mold;

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,610
stains;

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,140
a watermark;

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,340
a tear-

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,750
with a darkened area that shows where it
had been previously repaired;

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,049
and at the corner,

20
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,690
the shadow of the piece of paper that had been used

21
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,060
to attach the drawing to a mount.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,870
Next she examines the drawing under
ultraviolet light.

23
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,010
The brown spots are called "foxing."

24
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,650
These are marks left by mold.

25
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,610
Finally, she studies the drawing under a microscope.

26
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,520
Now, the conservator tests the solubility
of the ink to ensure it won't bleed during treatment.

27
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,369
She places the drawing on a vacuum table,

28
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,210
a device that

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,720
extracts the liquids used in the treatment,
out of the paper.

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,220
She uses this small brash to apply an ammoniated
water solution

31
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:10,869
to reduce the brown "foxing." This solution subtly
releases the color of the foxing,

32
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,709
which distracts from the appearance of the drawing.

33
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:19,430
She carefully alternates the application of
ammoniated water

34
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,480
with that of ethanol, in order to reduce
"tide lines"-

35
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,379
irregular lines or blemishes

36
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:32,679
left behind as the ammoniated water solution dries.

37
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:34,490
Wearing magnifying lenses,

38
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,790
she examines tears and prepares them for mending
and reinforcement.

39
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,539
She takes the piece of Japanese tissue

40
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:49,539
and carefully applies wheat starch paste to
mend the tear.

41
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:55,080
Japanese paper has very strong fibers,

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,649
is chemically neutral,

43
00:02:56,649 --> 00:03:01,900
and can easily be identified and removed.

44
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,920
She allows the paste to set

45
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,340
by putting the drawing between blotters

46
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:13,340
and weighing it down with glass blocks and weights.

47
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:18,959
To complete the conservation treatment,

48
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,400
the entire drying is humidified

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,450
and then placed under weights with blotters

50
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,869
to remove the moisture and flatten it.

51
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:33,250
This process extends over a two-week period
and the blotters are repeatedly replaced

52
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,930
to facilitate drying.

53
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,230
The goal of conservation isn't to make a drawing
look "new" again.

54
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,819
Rather, it's to safely reduce the damage
that distracts from the design

55
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:53,219
and bring the sheet closer to the artist's original intent.

56
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:55,879
Evidence of age is still present,

57
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,200
but now recedes into the background

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,299
so that you may focus on the drawing.
