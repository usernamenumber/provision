1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,179
Calculate the sum of all positive divisors of 27 000

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:07,073
The easiest thing that i can think of doing

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:10,019
is first take the prime factorization of 27000

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,573
and that will help us kind of structure our thought

5
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:16,257
of what all the different divisors of 27000

6
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:17,916
would have to look like

7
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:25,953
so 27000 is the same thing as 27 times 1000

8
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:27,315
which is the same thing as

9
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:30,319
3 to the 3rd times 10 to the 3rd

10
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:33,485
and 10 is of course the same thing as 2 times 5

11
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:37,606
so this is the same thing as 2 times 5 to the third

12
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:42,000
or the same thing as 2^3 times 5^3

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,388
So 27000 is equal to 2^3 times 3^3 times 5^3.

14
00:00:52,388 --> 00:00:55,008
So any divisor of 27000

15
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:57,461
is going to have to be made up of

16
00:00:57,461 --> 00:00:58,576
the product of

17
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:03,806
up to three 2, up to three 3, and up to three 5.

18
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:05,488
So let's try and look at all the combinations

19
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:08,000
and think of a fast way of solving it.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,016
Lets say that it has no 5's in the divisor.

21
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:17,026
So if it has no 5's, then it can have up to three 2's.

22
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:19,312
So if it has zero 2's

23
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,758
So I am going to take the powers of 2's

24
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:22,279
So lets say it has zero 2's

25
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:23,741
then I'll put a 1 here

26
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,046
if it has two 2's then it has to be divisible by 4

27
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:28,966
and if it has three 2's it is going to be divisible by 8

28
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:31,901
when I say three 2, I mean 2 x 2 x 2

29
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:36,214
Now let's do the same thing with 3's

30
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:37,586
Oh wait I forgot a power

31
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:38,670
If it had zero 2's

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,021
it means it is just divisible by 1.

33
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:41,644
for we're looking at the 2

34
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:45,016
If it has one 2, then it has to be divisible by just 2

35
00:01:45,016 --> 00:01:47,055
If you have two 2's it is divisible by 4

36
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:49,059
and if you have three 2's

37
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:53,677
and what i mean by that is 2x2x2 it is divisible by 8.

38
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:56,099
Lets do the same thing with 3.

39
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,495
From the point of view of 3

40
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:58,194
if you have no 3

41
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:00,413
then that means at least you you're deivisable by 1.

42
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:03,587
if you have one 3, that means you're divisible by 3

43
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:08,128
Two 3's, or 3 times 3, means you are divisible by 9

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:08,962
if you have three 3's

45
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,275
that means you are divisible by 27.

46
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:13,749
So let's look at all the possible combinations

47
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:16,539
in this grid that I am going to generate right here

48
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,724
We assume that you are not divisible by 5

49
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:23,054
or you are only divisible by 5 to the zero power

50
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:24,860
So what are all the possible numbers here.

51
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:35,322
You have 1x1 = 1 ; 1x3 = 3 ; 1x9 = 9 ; 1x27 = 27

52
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,792
So these are all the numbers

53
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:40,227
that have up to three 3's in them

54
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,048
from 0 to three 3 in them

55
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,548
and they have no 2's in them

56
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:44,735
If you have another 2 in here

57
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:47,157
you essentially multiply all these numbers by 2.

58
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:48,899
If you have another 2 in here

59
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:50,767
you are going to multiply all these numbers by two.

60
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:51,868
Now before I do this

61
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,452
because I want to do this as fast as possible

62
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:55,098
I could figure out what these numbers are

63
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:56,533
I could multiply them

64
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,000
But instead lets just take the sum

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,223
let's just take the sum of this row

66
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,059
the first row we just did.

67
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:06,767
We have 1 + 3 + 9 + 27

68
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:13,040
3 + 27 = 30; 1 + 9 = 10,

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,023
so this is going to be 40.

70
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:17,951
Now whatever these numbers are

71
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,074
they are just going to be 2 times these numbers.

72
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,297
So the sum is going to be 80.

73
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:24,017
And the sum over here is going to be

74
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:25,460
2 times the previous row

75
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,687
because here we were multiplying by 2

76
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:28,720
here we are multiplying by 4

77
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,040
So it is going to be 160.

78
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,231
And over here we just multiply by 2 again.

79
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:35,081
It is going to be 320.

80
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,380
Or another way of thinking about it is

81
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,557
whatever the sum is here

82
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:40,371
it is going to be 8 times the sum of the first row

83
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:42,360
and I could, just so you know what I am doing

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,800
I could actually put numbers here.

85
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,432
This number will be 8, 24, 72 and whatever 8x27 is

86
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:53,697
Now what is that 160 + 56 = 216

87
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:55,111
But we don't want to do that

88
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,325
we just have to think about the sums.

89
00:03:57,325 --> 00:04:00,151
If you think about all the divisors of 2700

90
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:01,763
that are not devisable by 5

91
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:04,064
so they're only divisible by 5 to the zero power

92
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:05,023
I guess you could say it

93
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:07,082
we have just now figured out their sum.

94
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:10,823
It is going to be the sum of all of these rows.

95
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:12,895
So if you take 40 + 80

96
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:22,150
you have 120 + 160 + 320 = 600

97
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,943
So this is the situation.

98
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:26,944
this is the sum of all of the combinations

99
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:28,376
of the 2's and the 3's

100
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:30,195
that don't have 5's in them.

101
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:35,493
Now if you took the same combination of 2's and 3's.

102
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:36,495
These added up to 600.

103
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:38,303
Let me write it over here.

104
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:40,403
These added up to 600.

105
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:43,609
So no 5's.

106
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:46,963
Now if you did the same exact thing we did here

107
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:49,628
but we just multiplied everything by 5.

108
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:51,509
so we then would be looking at the combinations

109
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:54,919
that have this many 2's and this many 3's and one 5

110
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,124
what would have this sum

111
00:04:57,124 --> 00:05:01,068
we would just multiply it by 5.

112
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,680
So we multiply 600 by 5

113
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,473
You get 30 with two zeros

114
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,805
So this is one 5

115
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:12,322
in the prime factorisation of the divisors

116
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:15,727
One 5. Just like that.

117
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:19,053
Now if I want two 5 I can just multiply by 5 again.

118
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:26,789
So if I multiply by 5 again I get 15 000

119
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,958
This is two 5's

120
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,809
Another way of thinking about this

121
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,773
if I just multiply every term here by 25

122
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:37,220
which is essentially just 5 times 5

123
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,041
this sum is going to be 600 x 25 which is 15000

124
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:47,013
Now if I have three 5

125
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,035
then I can just multiply this by 5 again.

126
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:59,605
5 times 15 is 75, so I get 75000

127
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:00,788
So now I know all the sums.

128
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:03,756
If I had no 5 the sum of all the divisors is 600

129
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:06,080
If we have one 5, 3000, and so on and so forth.

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,530
So if I want the sum of everything

131
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,072
I just take the sum of these numbers.

132
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:12,930
Let me just scroll down a bit.

133
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,619
So I have zero, zero,

134
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:19,583
then in the hundreds place I only have a 6.

135
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:24,093
And them 3 + 5 + 5 is 13, is that right?

136
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:28,000
yep, thats 13. and then carry the one.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,511
and then I have a 9.

138
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,960
So I have 93600

139
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,195
So the sum of all posible divisors of 27000 is 93600.

140
00:06:40,195 --> 99:59:59,999
Hope you found that entertaining.
