00:00:00,702 --> 99:59:59,999
In this video i want to clarify a little bit about why we calculate the percent

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
changes when we're thinking about elasticity the way that we do

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so just to remind ourselves and we'll focus on the price elasticity of demand although we've

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
been exposed to other types of elasticiticies already but just as a review

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the price elasticity of demand. So the elasticity of demand

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is definied as the percent change in quantity

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
demanded over the percent change, the percent change

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in price, so first i'll calculate the conventional way, the way that you would

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in a tradional microeconomics class

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then i'll calculate it the way that you would just

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
based on how you would tradionally calculate percentages and we'll see why

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
microeconomists like to do it the way that they do, so first

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we'll talk about it the correct way, i'll put it in quotes

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cause correct is really just by definition really just by

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
convention.But we first think about the percent change in

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
quantity, percent change in quantity, were gonna assume

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're gonna calculate the elasticity of demand between point A over here

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
point A and point B over here

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so what is our percent change in quantity? well our absolute change

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in quantity from going to A to

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
B, we have increased by 2

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have increased by 2, i'll write it down here. This is gonna be 2 over

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is kinda the slightly

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
strange thing that we do when we calculate our percentages we don't say 2 over 4

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we say 2 over the average of 4 and 6, 2 over the

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
average of our starting point and our ending point and the average of

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4 and 6 is 5. So this is going to be, we have a

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
40 percent change based on how we calculate the percentages

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in our quantity demanded and let's do our

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
percent change in price this is all going to be over our percent change in price so our absolute change in price is

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative 1 dollar, negative 1 dollar and then

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
instead of doing it over our starting point over 2

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we do it over the average of the two, over

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over 150, negative 1 over

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
150 is negative two-thirds or right about negative

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative 66.7 percent

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if we say roughly, so this right over here. so based

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on how we calculate our percentages and i want to make it clear this is kind of a strange way

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we do over the midpoint of the starting and ending point

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we're saying the percent change from a to b in quantity

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so our percent change in quantity this right over here

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are saying it is 40 percent and than we are saying

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that this percent change in price right over here is

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative 66.7 percent

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now the reason why this is valuable and obviously if you do the math right here

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
40 percent over negative 66.7 percent your going to get

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some lets see something in the 6's

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but lets actually get out a calculator to calculate it

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it would be 40 divided by 66.7

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
gives you, its almost 60. So its roughly

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
.60 if we were to round. It is approximately

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
0.60. Its .597 something

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll just leave it there, wait.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
.60 Now whats cool about

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this and whats useful about this, this is reason why we economists

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
do it, you would get the same answer if you were going from a to b

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or whether your going from b to a. And this is the situation were going from

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a to b but if we were going b to a

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its the exact same thing. If we go from b to a

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what is our change in quantity? Our change in quantity is

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative 2. It would be negative 2 over

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now you wouldn't do it over your starting point, you would do it over the average

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is why we will get the same value regardless of which direction we go

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in and so we get the average of 4 and 6 which is 5

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and thats going to be over now going from b to a what is our

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
change in price. our change in price is plus 1

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over the average of our starting point

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and our ending point. Over 150 now these are

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
exact same quantities both are going to be a negative number here the negative is

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the bottom and here the negative is on top. Either way

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your going to eventually, this is a negative .60 because of positive divided by a negative

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is too when you evaluate it is gonna turn out to be

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
exact same thing. negative zero point

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
.60. now if you calculate percentages in the traditional way

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you would not get the same value for price elasticity of demand

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
whether you go from a to b and b to a. and just to

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
show that to you and i'll put this in quotation marks

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because its not the wrong way to do this in general in fact this how you would calculate

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
price changes traditionally, but its not how you do it

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the microeconomic sense and so if you do it the wrong way

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you said from a to b you have a

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you have your absolute change in quantity is plus 2

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and your base this

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
remember this is the way its done outside of microeconomics

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your base is 4 and then your change in price went down 1 and your base started at A and your base is 2.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the way you do it outside of an economics class.

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so you get, this would be equal to 50 percent plus 50 percent over negative 50 percent.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you would essentially get 1, going from A to B. Using a traditional way of calculating percent change.

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What happens when you go from B to A?

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well now all of a sudden your change in quantity is negative 2 and your base starting point is six and your change in price, is once again increasing your price by 1 from B to A and this is plus 1 and your base is now 1.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you will get negative 33 percent roughly over 100 percent.

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this will be equal to negative negative .33.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Notice when you calculate percentages in the traditional way you get a different answer going from A to B or whether your going from B to A.

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The whole reason why we take the percentages over the averages of our starting and ending point.

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we get the same value for the elasticity of demand along this portion of the curve.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You could really view as the average elasticity of demand of this portion of the curve.
