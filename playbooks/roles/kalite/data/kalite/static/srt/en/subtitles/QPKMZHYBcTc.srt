1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,470
   

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,930
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,020
I don't like to rush too
much on these videos.

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,060
I just wanted to continue
the next one.

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,170
So what we did, I just wrote out
everything they tell us in

6
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,040
the problem.

7
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,780
We figured out x is equal to
y, so they must both be

8
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,520
45-degree angles.

9
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,910
And since y is opposite of this
angle, it must be 45.

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,690
And since this angle, this
angle, and this angle are the

11
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,450
same triangle and this one's
45 and this one's 90, this

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,410
must also equal 45.

13
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,070
And what I said is we need to
figure out this green line.

14
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,280
And I made the claim, and I
think you'll believe me, that

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,930
this green line is the
same length of the

16
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,410
line that I just drew.

17
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,400
This peach line, right?

18
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,610
And also, what else do we know
about this larger triangle?

19
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,505
Well, its hypotenuse is here.

20
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:45,480
Its hypotenuse is this magenta
line right there.

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,920
And let me redraw it here.

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,390
So its hypotenuse is
this magenta line.

23
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,120
What's the length of
the magenta line?

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,550
It's 4 plus 8.

25
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,480
They gave us that information.

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,510
So it's 12.

27
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,360
And we want to figure
out this peach line.

28
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,720
I'm just re-drawing it so that
you know that we're clear of

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,360
all of the mess, right?

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm saying this green line is
the same as this peach line,

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,620
and I just re-drew this
peach line here.

32
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,010
What do we also know about
this triangle?

33
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,870
Well, if this angle up here is
45, what's this angle here?

34
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,410
That's also going
to be 45, right?

35
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,590
Because these two lines are
perpendicular, so this is 45.

36
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,870
And we also know that this angle
x is this angle here, so

37
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,850
that's also 45.

38
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,020
Or you can figure it
out any other way.

39
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,440
So there we go.

40
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,770
We have a 45-45-90 triangle.

41
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,710
We know its hypotenuse.

42
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,650
Can we figure out the sides?

43
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,500
Well we know the sides are
going to be equal, right?

44
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,860
Because the base angles
are equal.

45
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,175
We also know that in
a 45-45-90 triangle

46
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:44,610
the sides are equal.

47
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,270
In fact, you can even look at
the beginning of the book,

48
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,130
they even define a 45-45-90
triangle.

49
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,540
But we'll work it out just so
you see it worked out without

50
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,690
having to memorize.

51
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,310
So x squared-- this is just
Pythagorean theorem-- plus x

52
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,380
squared is equal to
the hypotenuse

53
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,500
squared is equal to 144.

54
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,290
2x squared is equal to 144.

55
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,410
x squared is equal to 72.

56
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,140
x is equal to the square
root of 72.

57
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,530
So what's the square
root of 72?

58
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,780
The square root of 72 is the
square root of 36 times 2,

59
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,440
which is the same thing as the
square root of 36 times the

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,320
square root of 2.

61
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,090
And what does that
turn out to be?

62
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,050
Well, the square root
of 36 is 6, right?

63
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,290
So our answer is 6 square
roots of 2.

64
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,900
So that is choice b.

65
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,150
Next problem.

66
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:49,410
   

67
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,660
Problem 8.

68
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,100
   

69
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,410
The price of ground
coffee bean is d

70
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,980
dollars for 8 ounces.

71
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,710
So d dollars for 8 ounces.

72
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,810
And each ounce makes c cups
of brewed coffee.

73
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:18,130
So one ounce makes c cups
of brewed coffee.

74
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:30,920
In terms of c and d, what is the
dollar cost of the ground

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,190
coffee beans required
to make one cup?

76
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,320
We just want to make one
cup and we say how much

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,950
does that cost us?

78
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,110
OK.

79
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,470
So let's see how many cups we
can make with d dollars, OK?

80
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,790
So d dollars, we would
get 8 ounces.

81
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,190
So d dollars, we get 8 ounces.

82
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,320
And then each ounce, you
get c cups, right?

83
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,540
One ounce turns into c cups,
so 8 ounces will

84
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,020
turn into 8c cups.

85
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,220
   

86
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,550
But we only want
one cup, right?

87
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:16,279
So we're saying d dollars
is equal to 8c cups.

88
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,060
But we only want one cup, so
let's divide both sides of

89
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,310
this by 8c.

90
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,070
   

91
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,870
So what are we left with?

92
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:32,890
We're left with d over 8c
dollars is equal to one cup.

93
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,010
And that is choice a.

94
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,270
Not too bad, huh?

95
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,520
Next problem.

96
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,350
   

97
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,655
Problem number 9.

98
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:48,930
   

99
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:57,250
If 10/a is equal to b/12,
what is the value of ab?

100
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,220
So this is just straight
cross-multiplication.

101
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,160
a times b is equal to 10 times
12, so ab is equal to 10 times

102
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,290
12, which equals 120.

103
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,120
We are done.

104
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,670
120 is our answer.

105
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,440
If you haven't learned to
cross-multiply, it's just a

106
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,880
quick way-- when you see two
fractions equal each other,

107
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,520
you can take the numerator of
the left times the denominator

108
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,570
of the right.

109
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,710
And that equals the denominator
of the left times

110
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,880
the numerator of the right.

111
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,820
And how do we know that?

112
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,110
Well, we could do
it step by step.

113
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,680
You can multiply both
sides times a.

114
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,350
That cancels out and you're
left with 10 is

115
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,060
equal to ab over 12.

116
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,950
And then you multiply both sides
times 12, you get 120 is

117
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,630
equal to ab.

118
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,350
That just skips one
step right there.

119
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,600
Next problem.

120
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,660
   

121
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,180
Problem 10.

122
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,360
They give us a little
sequence here.

123
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,990
150, 30, 6, and then
it keeps going.

124
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,730
In the sequence above, each term
after the first term is

125
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,780
1/5 of the preceding term.

126
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,310
What is the fifth term
of the sequence?

127
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,550
So 1/5 of the preceding term.

128
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,260
So the next term is going
to be 1/5 of this.

129
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,260
So that's what, that's
6/5, right?

130
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,040
I just multiplied
1/5 times that.

131
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,100
So the next term is going to be
1/5 times this, so that's

132
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,900
6/25, right?

133
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:28,400
1/5 times 6/5 is
equal to 6/25.

134
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,080
So that is the fifth term.

135
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,220
And you could write it as a
fraction or you could write it

136
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,020
as a decimal, I think
you'd get 0.24 if

137
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,370
you do it as a decimal.

138
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,660
Next problem.

139
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm suspicious, that
seemed too easy.

140
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:51,930
Problem 11.

141
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,520
Five points-- a, b, c, d, and
e-- lie on a line, not

142
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,540
necessarily in that order.

143
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,170
ab has length 24.

144
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,120
Point c is the midpoint of ab.

145
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,590
So let's draw this and
let's see if we can

146
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,590
avoid messing up.

147
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,450
OK.

148
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,810
So let me draw a and b.

149
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:22,770
So a, b.

150
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,876
This is how I'd do it if
I was taking it, taking

151
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:27,230
the test. ab is 24.

152
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,380
Point c is the midpoint of ab.

153
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,620
So point c is right here.

154
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,810
And it's the midpoint.

155
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,140
So this is 12, and this is 12.

156
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,040
So far so good?

157
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,650
And point d is the
midpoint of ac.

158
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,820
   

159
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,540
So this distance is 6, and this
distance is 6, right?

160
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,330
It's getting smaller.

161
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,910
I should have drawn this bigger,
but I think you get

162
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,710
what I'm saying.

163
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,380
This is point d here
in yellow.

164
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:02,530
If the distance between d and
e-- so this is d-- and the

165
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,950
distance between d and e is 5,
what is one possible distance

166
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,000
between a and e?

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,895
So they're essentially saying
where could e be?

168
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:14,400
   

169
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,520
So let me blow things
up a little bit.

170
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,160
Let me redraw this.

171
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,890
   

172
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,180
And let me focus on a and c
because that's the part that

173
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,980
got all scrunched up.

174
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:38,840
So if this is a, this is c, and
they tell us that d is the

175
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,090
midpoint of these two.

176
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,919
   

177
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,970
And we figured out that a to c
was 12 and a to d is 6, right?

178
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,040
This distance is 6, which is
the same as this distance,

179
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,870
that's also 6.

180
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,270
And then they tell us at the
end, if the distance between d

181
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,930
and e is 5, what is one
possible distance

182
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,240
between a and e?

183
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,920
So we know that e is on
this line as well.

184
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,880
So there's two places
where e could be.

185
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,950
e could be 5 in this direction,
it could be here.

186
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,650
e could be there or e could be 5
in this direction where this

187
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,540
is 5 and this is 5.

188
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,390
So if e is here, what is the
distance from a to e?

189
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,810
Well, this distance from
a to e is just

190
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,240
going to be 1, right?

191
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,160
You go one to e and then 5 to
d, and that adds up to 6.

192
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,260
So one possible distance
for ae is 1.

193
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,880
The other one is you go 6 to
d and then you go 5 to e.

194
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,510
So the other possibility
is 11.

195
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,680
And so, oh, this isn't
multiple choice.

196
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,070
You could fill out either
one of those choices.

197
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,830
See you in the next video.

198
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,300
