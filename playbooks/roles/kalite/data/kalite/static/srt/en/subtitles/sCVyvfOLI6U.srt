1
00:00:00,588 --> 00:00:08,091
Let's see if we can write the fraction "11 over 25" (or we can call it "eleven twenty-fifths") to see if we can write that as a decimal

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,237
and we're gonna round it to the nearest thousands place.

3
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:14,294
And so another way of viewing this, eleven over twenty-five,

4
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:17,329
this is the same thing as eleven divided by twenty-five,

5
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:22,680
so we can literally say, we can literally divide 25 into 11 and whatever we get

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,503
that is going to be the decimal representation of 11/25.

7
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:32,223
And, since we're going to go into the places less than the ones place

8
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:35,222
we're gonna go into the tenths place and the hundredths place and the thousandths place,

9
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:39,913
let's add some zeroes to this eleven right over here after the decimal

10
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,529
and now let's start to divide.

11
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:44,044
25 doesn't go into 1

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,788
25 doesn't go into 11.

13
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:49,309
25 does go into 110.

14
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:56,506
So, when 25 goes into 110 four times (4 x 25 is 100), so it goes into it 4 times

15
00:00:56,506 --> 00:01:00,079
let's keep the decimal up here, so we'll write 0.4

16
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:08,473
4 times 25 is 100, and now we can subtract: 110 minus 100 is 10.

17
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:11,689
And now we can bring down another zero.

18
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:23,025
25 goes into 100 exactly four times. 4 x 25 is 100, and then you subtract and you get zero.

19
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:27,025
so we actually didn't even have to round this one. This fraction is exactly, this is exactly 0.44.
