We're asked to solve the right triangle shown below. Give the lengths to the nearest tenth. So when they say "solve" the right triangle, we can assume that they're saying "Hey, figure out the lengths of all the sides". So whatever a is equal to, whatever b is equal to. And also, what are the angles of the right triangle. They've given two of them. We might have to figure out this third, right over here. So there's multiple ways to tackle this but we'll just go and try to tackle side 'xw' first. Try to figure out what 'a' is. And I'll give you a hint. You can use a calculator, and using a calculator, you can use your trigonometric functions that we've looked at a good bit now. So I'll give you a few seconds to think about how to figure out what 'a' is.

Well, what do we know? We know this angle 'y', right over here. We know the side adjacent to angle 'y'. And length 'a' - that's the length of the side that is opposite to angle 'y'. So, what trigonometric ratio deals with the opposite and the adjacent? So if we're looking at angle 'y'; relative to angle 'y', this is the opposite and this, right over here, is the adjacent.

Well, if we don't remember, we can go back to 'sou caw toa'. Sin deals with opposites and hypotenuse. Co-sin deals with adjacent and hypotenuse. Tangent deals with opposite over adjacent.
