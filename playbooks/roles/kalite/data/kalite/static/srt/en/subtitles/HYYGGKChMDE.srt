00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,588
Danielle just bought some potatoes at the market.

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:12,033
She paid p over 7 dollars for them, 
and they weighed 2/9ths pounds.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:21,302
If potatoes cost r dollars per pound (lb), which of the following is true for all possible values of p and r?

4
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:23,771
Select all that apply.

5
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,585
So let's think about this a little bit.

6
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:32,709
How ever many lbs I buy, if I multiply that 
times the dollar per lb, that's going to give me
the total price that I pay.

7
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:35,103
So, let me just write that down.

8
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:37,242
2/9ths...2/9ths...

9
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:41,709
(and I can even put the units there if I want, but they don't express units there, so I won't do that here).

10
00:00:41,803 --> 00:00:48,314
But if I take the number of lbs times 
the dollar cost per lb...times the dollar cost per lb...

11
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:56,168
...that should be equal to the total amount that I paid. So in this case that is p over 7.

12
00:00:56,476 --> 00:01:02,435
So we know that this is the relationship between 2/9ths r and p over 7.

13
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:07,706
Now I don't see...I don't see this relationship over here on the right hand side.

14
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:12,867
So I must have to manipulate it somehow in order to get something like that over here.

15
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:15,106
So let's see the different ways
that I can manipulate it.

16
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:20,169
And maybe the first thing I'll see is that, like maybe let me try to solve for p and see what I get.

17
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:25,327
So to solve for p, I would multiply 
both sides of this equation by 7.

18
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,910
So let's do that. Let's multiply both sides by 7.

19
00:01:29,449 --> 00:01:40,173
And so on the left hand side I would end up with 
7 times 2 is 14...14 over 9r...r...

20
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:46,572
...is equal to...well that cancels with that...
is that...that is equal to p.

21
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:48,360
And that's exactly what you have over here.

22
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:54,184
Here they just wrote it the other way around. 
They wrote p is equal to 14 over 9 times r.

23
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:59,575
If you have 14/9ths r, that implicitly means 
you're multiplying 14 over 9 times r.

24
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:05,661
So this and this are the exact same thing. 
So let me check...let me check that one.

25
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:09,765
Now, this one over here, or both of these, 
they try to solve for r.

26
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:13,036
So let's see which one is the 
correct one when I solve for r.

27
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:20,170
So to solve for r (right over here), I could multiply both sides of this equation times 9 over 14.

28
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:27,103
(9 over 14...9 over 14)...that cancels with that, 
that cancels with that,

29
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:38,770
and I am left with r...r...(actually let me just do that)...r is equal to 9 over 14p.

30
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:45,307
Or...or I could write 9 over 14 times p, since they're explicitly writing the multiplication sign out there,

31
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:50,586
but if I just wrote 9/14ths p, 
that's the same thing as 9 over 14 times p.

32
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,581
(So let me write a little bit neater 
so you don't think p is in the denominator)...

33
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:55,064
...times p.

34
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:55,812
Alright!

35
00:02:55,905 --> 00:03:01,561
So r is definitely not 2/63rds times p, 
r is 9 over 14 times p.

36
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:03,773
So we'll go with that one right over there.

37
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:10,663
And then finally, they solve...they're solving for 14 over 9. Let's see if this is true right over here.

38
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:16,634
So we could go back to what we have, we could go back to this...we could go back to this...

39
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:23,169
and we saw that 14 over 9 is eq...
14 over 9 times r is equal to p.

40
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:34,036
If we wanted to solve for 14 over 9, we could divide 
both sides by r and you would get 
14 over 9 is equal to p over r.

41
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:36,834
Not p times r. So this one is not true.

42
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:39,651
So these are the two that actually apply.
