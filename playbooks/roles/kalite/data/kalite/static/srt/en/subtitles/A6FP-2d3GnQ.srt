1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,910
We're on problem 129.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,870
On a recent trip, Cindy drove her car 290 miles,

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,390
rounded to the nearest 10 miles,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,570
and used 12 gallons of gasoline,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,080
rounded to the nearest gallons.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,280
The actual number of miles per gallon that

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,180
Cindy's car got on this trip must have been between?

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,380
So they want us to kind of say these are the rounded numbers,

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,000
now what were the actual numbers between,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,170
and then from that what's the range of miles per gallon?

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,690
So if this is rounded to the nearest 10,

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:47,920
then her miles had to have been greater than or equal to 285,

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,160
because anything 285 or more would have been rounded to 290.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,380
But then less than 295 because anything less than 295 would

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,030
be rounded down, but 295 itself would be rounded up to 300.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:11,190
And her gallons had to have been greater than or equal to

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,090
11.5 gallons, by the same logic, and less than 12.5 gallons.

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,080
So what was the lowest possible miles per gallon?

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,160
So the lowest possible miles per gallon would have the

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,330
lowest miles and the highest gallons. You want to minimize

21
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,050
the numerator and maximize the denominator.

22
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:36,940
So lowest possible miles would be 285.

23
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,180
And the highest possible gallons,

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,390
at least it'll approach 12.5.

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,190
So 12.499999 is the possible number of gallons,

26
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,630
so it'll approach this.

27
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,590
But it can never be exactly 12.5 gallons,

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,660
so her miles per gallon are going to be greater than this.

29
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,710
It would've been greater than equal to this with like

30
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,440
12.499999, but since 12.5 can never get there, we're going

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,080
to be greater than this in terms of miles per gallon.

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,900
And then the highest possible miles per gallon is the

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,610
highest possible miles, which is 295.

34
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,060
But we're never going to be able to go twice quite there.

35
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,760
We're always going to be less than 295.

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,730
And then the lowest number of gallons-- going the highest

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,540
mileage with the lowest possible gallons,

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,030
you want to minimize the demonimator-- divided by 11.5.

39
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,100
Let's see if that is a choice.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,510
I don't see that exactly, but choice D looks interesting

41
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,100
because choice D says-- so they say the actual number of

42
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,110
miles per gallon that Cindy's car got on this trip must have

43
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,030
been between.

44
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:55,600
Choice D looks close to what we have because we have this.

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,570
Choice D says between 284 divided by 12.5.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,500
That's going to be even less than that,

47
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,530
because you have the 12.5 but the numerator's less.

48
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,040
So that's going to be even lower than the range that we have.

49
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:20,000
And then on choice D, 295 divided 11.4.

50
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,340
This number is larger than this number, because you have

51
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,650
the same numerator and you have a smaller denominator.

52
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,020
So you're dividing by a smaller number.

53
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,680
So this number's larger.

54
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,220
So if her miles per gallon is between these two numbers,

55
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,740
and these two numbers are between these two numbers,

56
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,590
then D is right.

57
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,640
Her miles per gallon need to be between 284 divided by 12.5

58
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,120
and 295 divided by 11.4. So it's choice D.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Problem 130.

60
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,540
Which of the following inequalities is an algebraic

61
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,000
expression for the shaded part of the number line above?

62
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,040
So this number line, let's try to draw it. That's the line.

63
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,760
And I'm not going to draw all of the dots on it,

64
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,870
but it essentially starts at positive 3 and it goes backwards

65
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,950
Let's switch colors.

66
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,190
It starts essentially from minus 5 to positive 3.

67
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,450
That's all of what this includes.

68
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,430
1, 0, and then minus 5.

69
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,840
So you could say that x is less than or equal to 3 because

70
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,010
it's filled in at 3, and greater than or equal to minus 5.

71
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,750
And that's not one of the choices.

72
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,900
They want it in terms of absolute value.

73
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,940
So how we can view this, this is a range around some number.

74
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Whenever you're dealing without absolute value,

75
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,030
you're essentially saying the distance from some number.

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,150
So this is a range of minus 5 and 3.

77
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,860
This has a length of 8, so they're both 4 away from minus 1.

78
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,700
Think about it. You could go 4 backwards or 4 forwards.

79
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,910
So one way to think about it is the difference between x

80
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:19,770
and minus 1, and that might be a negative or positive

81
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,860
difference depending on whether we're positive or negative,

82
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,280
depending on whether we're above negative 1 or

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,000
below negative 1. But we just want the absolute difference.

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,860
We just want the distance away from negative 1.

85
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,310
And that's given by this,

86
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,500
the difference between any x and negative 1. And

87
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
we took the absolute value in case x is less than negative 1.

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,040
The distance is going to be less than or equal to 4,

89
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,280
because if we go above negative 1 we're at most at 3,

90
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,010
which is 4 more than negative 1.

91
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,860
If we go below negative 1, we're at minus 5 which is 4

92
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,040
less than negative 1. So it's less than or equal to 4.

93
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,010
if you simplify this, you get x plus 1,

94
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,040
the absolute value is less than or equal to 4.

95
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,240
And that is choice E. And this is a useful skill.

96
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,660
You have probably taken the SAT already, but in general,

97
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,810
a lot of standardized tests think of absolute value as a

98
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,650
distance in 1 dimension.So the distance along the number line

99
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,090
So they're saying all of these points,

100
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,180
they're within some range from 1 point.

101
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,730
And you can say if you take the midpoint of this,

102
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,600
you're at negative 1.

103
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,630
And every point here's within 4 of negative 1.

104
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,860
So the distance between every point on this line,

105
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,200
every x that satisfies this and negative 1,

106
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,510
the distance is less than or equal to 4.

107
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,410
Anyway, I kind of just did the problem twice for you.

108
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,690
Problem 131.

109
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:51,130
A factory has 500 workers, 15% of whom are women.

110
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,450
So 15% times 500 is equal to women.

111
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,490
If 50 additional workers are to be hired and all of the

112
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,940
present workers remain, how many of the additional workers

113
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,720
must be women in order to raise the percent of women

114
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,120
employees to 20%?

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,850
So how many women workers do we have right now?

116
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:19,740
5 times 15, we have 75 workers. 15 times 500.

117
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:31,260
We have 75 women right now.

118
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,630
If we wanted to find the proportion of women,

119
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:39,070
it's 75 over 500, which is once again 15. It's 15%.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,170
We're going to add a total of 50 workers to this population.

121
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,560
And they want to know how many of the additional workers must

122
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,830
be women in order to raise the percent of women

123
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,010
population to 20%. So we're adding 50 total workers.

124
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,030
So how many of those have to be women in order for the new

125
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,990
proportion-- this is going to be the new number of women,

126
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,060
the number of women that are added to the 75 that were

127
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,470
already there-- divided by the 500 workers who were there,

128
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,670
plus the 50, some of whom might be women.

129
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,130
So this now has to equal 20%.

130
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:20,270
We get 75 plus w over 550 is equal to 0.2.

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,480
So we get 75 plus the number of women that need to be added

132
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:35,340
is equal to 0.2 times 550. We multiply both sides times 550.

133
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:47,550
That equals 110. And then subtract 75 from both sides.

134
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,400
Women has to be equal to 110 minus 75.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,090
And that's equal to-- 25 plus 10-- that's equal to 35.

136
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,550
35 of the 50 employees have to be women.

137
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,690
And that's what they asked.

138
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,960
How many of the additional workers must be women?

139
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,210
So that's choice E.

140
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:15,070
Next question, 132.

141
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,400
At a small snack shop, the average arithmetic mean

142
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,820
revenue was $400 per day over a 10 day period.

143
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,140
So the average over 10 days was $400.

144
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,710
During this period, if the average daily revenue was $360

145
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:34,000
for the first 6 days-- so the average of 6 days was $360--

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,030
what was the average daily revenue for the last 4 days?

147
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,000
So we've done a lot of problems like this.

148
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,730
Hopefully this is a bit of second nature if you've

149
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,000
watched the solution to the other ones.

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,050
But what's the average of all of them?

151
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,000
It's the average of the first 6 days.

152
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,110
We can almost assume that the first 6 days had exactly $360

153
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,740
in revenue. So their average times 6.

154
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,050
So this would be the total revenue of the first 6 days

155
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,760
plus what's the total revenue of the next 4 days?

156
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,010
It's going to be the average of the next 4 days times 4.

157
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,040
That would be the total of those 4.

158
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,240
We're not saying that they all have to be exactly the average

159
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,800
but when you sum them all up they're equal to the

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,170
average times 4. Now if you divide all of those,

161
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,000
this is a total of the revenue all 10 days.

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,430
If you take that sum and divide it by 10,

163
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,000
you get the average for the 10 days.

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,040
And that is equal to $400. Let's simplify this a little bit.

165
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,870
Let's see what we could do.

166
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:44,080
So we get 360 times 6 plus the average for 4 days times 4 is

167
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,780
equal to 10 times 400, which is 4,000.

168
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,230
Before I get too involved in multiplication,

169
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,500
let's divide both sides of this equation by 4.

170
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,920
So 360 divided by 4, that's 90,

171
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,030
times 6 plus this divided by 4 plus A4 is equal to 1,000.

172
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:10,070
90 times 6 is 540 plus the average of the 4

173
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,030
days is equal to 1,000.

174
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:17,050
So the average of the 4 days is equal to 1,000 minus 540.

175
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:24,410
Which is what? That's $460 per day. And that's choice D.

176
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,000
And I'm out of time. See you in the next video.
