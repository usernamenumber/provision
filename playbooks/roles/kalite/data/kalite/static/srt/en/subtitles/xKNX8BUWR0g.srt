1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,080
In this video I want to
introduce you to some

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,460
terminology that will be useful
in our discussion of

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,140
functions and invertibility.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,970
And this is, in general,
terminology that you'll

6
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,476
probably see in your
mathematical careers.

7
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:17,160
So let's say I have a function
f, and it is a mapping from

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,420
the set x to the set y.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,630
We've drawn this diagram many
times, but it never hurts to

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,310
draw it again.

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,490
So that is my set
x or my domain.

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,750
And then this is the set y over
here, or the co-domain.

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,370
Remember the co-domain is the
set that you're mapping to.

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,430
You don't necessarily have to
map to every element of the

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,940
set, or none of the elements
of the set.

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,240
This is just all of the
elements, the set that you

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,820
might map elements in
your co-domain to.

18
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,670
So let's see.

19
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,280
If I have some element there, f
will map it to some element

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,970
in y in my co-domain.

21
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,700
   

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,490
So the first idea, or term, I
want to introduce you to, is

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,720
the idea of a function
being surjective.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
   

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,960
And sometimes this
is called onto.

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,340
   

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,590
And a function is surjective or
onto, if for every element

28
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,750
in your co-domain-- so let me
write it this way, if for

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:34,560
every, let's say y, that is a
member of my co-domain, there

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,250
exists-- that's the little
shorthand notation for exists

31
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:48,510
--there exists at least
one x that's a

32
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,090
member of x, such that.

33
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,560
And I can write such
that, like that.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,570
Actually, let me just
write the word out.

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:03,710
Such that f of x
is equal to y.

36
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,320
So it's essentially saying, you
can pick any y here, and

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,050
every y here is being mapped
to by at least one of

38
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,790
the x's over here.

39
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,660
So, for example, actually let
me draw a simpler example

40
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,270
instead of drawing
these blurbs.

41
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,130
Let's say that I have
a set y that

42
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,990
literally looks like this.

43
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,540
Let's say that a set y-- I'll
draw it very --and let's say

44
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,170
it has four elements.

45
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,660
It has the elements
a, b, c, and d.

46
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,760
This is my set y right there.

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,020
And let's say my set
x looks like that.

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:47,190
And let's say it has the
elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.

49
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,140
Now, in order for my function f
to be surjective or onto, it

50
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,750
means that every one of these
guys have to be able

51
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,550
to be mapped to.

52
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,560
So what does that mean?

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,880
If every one of these
guys, let me

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,140
just draw some examples.

55
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,510
Let's say that this
guy maps to that.

56
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,980
Let's say that this
guy maps to that.

57
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,500
Let's say that this
guy maps to that.

58
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,270
And let's say, let me draw a
fifth one right here, let's

59
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,440
say that both of these guys
right here map to d.

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,650
So f of 4 is d and
f of 5 is d.

61
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,110
This is an example of a
surjective function.

62
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,270
So these are the mappings
of f right here.

63
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:33,990
This function right here
is onto or surjective.

64
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,740
Why is that?

65
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,120
Because every element here
is being mapped to.

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,580
Now, let me give you an example
of a function that is

67
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,870
not surjective.

68
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,000
Let me add some more
elements to y.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,690
Let's say element y has another
element here called e.

70
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,980
Now, all of a sudden, this
is not surjective.

71
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,440
   

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,360
And why is that?

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,380
Because there's some element
in y that is not

74
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,860
being mapped to.

75
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,770
If I tell you that f is a
surjective function, it means

76
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,400
if you take, essentially, if you
map all of these values,

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,220
everything here is being mapped
to by at least one

78
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
element here.

79
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,839
So you could have it, everything
could be kind of a

80
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,870
one-to-one mapping.

81
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,190
And I'll define that a little
bit better in the future.

82
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,630
So it could just be like
that, and like that.

83
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,920
And you could even have, it's
at least one, so you could

84
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,480
even have two things in here
mapping to one thing in here.

85
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,230
But the main requirement
is that everything here

86
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,090
does get mapped to.

87
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,840
Another way to think about it,
is that if you take the image.

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,600
So surjective function--
let me write this here.

89
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,480
   

90
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,020
Let me write it this way --so if
I say that f is surjective

91
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,100
or onto, these are equivalent
terms, that means that the

92
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,560
image of f.

93
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,660
Remember the image was, all
of the values that f

94
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,360
actually maps to.

95
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,125
So that means that the image
of f is equal to y.

96
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,930
   

97
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,460
Now, we learned before, that
your image doesn't have to

98
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,930
equal your co-domain.

99
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,680
But if you have a surjective
or an onto function, your

100
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,590
image is going to equal
your co-domain.

101
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,990
Everything in your co-domain
gets mapped to.

102
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,450
Actually, another word
for image is range.

103
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:33,030
You could also say that your
range of f is equal to y.

104
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,070
Remember the difference-- and
I drew this distinction when

105
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,270
we first talked about functions
--the distinction

106
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,560
between a co-domain and a range,
a co-domain is the set

107
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
that you can map to.

108
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
You don't have to map
to everything.

109
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,510
The range is a subset of
your co-domain that you

110
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,970
actually do map to.

111
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,840
If you were to evaluate the
function at all of these

112
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,130
points, the points that you
actually map to is your range.

113
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,540
And that's also called
your image.

114
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,340
And the word image
is used more in a

115
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,440
linear algebra context.

116
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,600
But if your image or your
range is equal to your

117
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,140
co-domain, if everything in your
co-domain does get mapped

118
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,730
to, then you're dealing
with a surjective

119
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,230
function or an onto function.

120
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,490
Now, the next term I want to
introduce you to is the idea

121
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,905
of an injective function.

122
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:28,250
   

123
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,820
And this is sometimes called
a one-to-one function.

124
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,950
So let me draw my domain
and co-domain again.

125
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,250
So let's say that that
is my domain

126
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,930
and this is my co-domain.

127
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,520
So this is x and this is y.

128
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:55,960
If I say that f is injective
or one-to-one, that implies

129
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,410
that for every value that is
mapped to-- so let me write it

130
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,800
this way --for every value that
is mapped to-- so let's

131
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,020
say, I'll say it a couple of
different ways --there is at

132
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,320
most one x that maps to it.

133
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,030
   

134
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,320
Or another way to say it is that
for any y that's a member

135
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,550
of y-- let me write it this
way --for any y that is a

136
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:31,850
member y, there is at most one--
let me write most in

137
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:40,840
capital --at most one x, such
that f of x is equal to y.

138
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,830
There might be no x's
that map to it.

139
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,270
So for example, you could have
a little member of y right

140
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,720
here that just never
gets mapped to.

141
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,820
Everyone else in y gets mapped
to, but that guy

142
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,740
never gets mapped to.

143
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,020
So this would be a case
where we don't have

144
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,660
a surjective function.

145
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,640
This is not onto because this
guy, he's a member of the

146
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,580
co-domain, but he's not
a member of the

147
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,610
image or the range.

148
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,140
He doesn't get mapped to.

149
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,400
But this would still be an
injective function as long as

150
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,830
every x gets mapped
to a unique y.

151
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,250
Now, how can a function not be
injective or one-to-one?

152
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,210
And I think you get the idea
when someone says one-to-one.

153
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,680
Well, if two x's here get mapped
to the same y, or three

154
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,110
get mapped to the same y, this
would mean that we're not

155
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:36,254
dealing with an injective or
a one-to-one function.

156
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:40,169
   

157
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,179
So that's all it means.

158
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,750
Let me draw another
example here.

159
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,270
   

160
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,400
Let's actually go back to
this example right here.

161
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,080
When I added this e here, we
said this is not surjective

162
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,640
anymore because every one
of these guys is not

163
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,100
being mapped to.

164
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,170
Is this an injective function?

165
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,310
Well, no, because I have f of 5
and f of 4 both mapped to d.

166
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,090
So this is what breaks its
one-to-one-ness or its

167
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,490
injectiveness.

168
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,910
This is what breaks it's
surjectiveness.

169
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,840
Now if I wanted to make this a
surjective and an injective

170
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,300
function, I would delete that
mapping and I would change f

171
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,920
of 5 to be e.

172
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,580
Now everything is one-to-one.

173
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,890
I don't have the mapping from
two elements of x, going to

174
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,750
the same element of y anymore.

175
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,340
And everything in y now
gets mapped to.

176
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,630
So this is both onto
and one-to-one.

177
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,999
