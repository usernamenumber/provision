00:00:01,045 --> 00:00:03,228
Now last couple of videos we set up a scenario

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:06,989
where company A intends to acquire company B

3
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:09,733
and they're going to do it by issuing 2 million shares,

4
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:13,723
giving those 2 million shares to shareholders of company B,

5
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:17,995
and company B shareholders will give essentially all of their ownership away

6
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:23,067
So there will be an exchange-- 2 million of Company A shares for 1 million of Company B shares.

7
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:28,398
Or, on a per share basis, the owners of Company B will give up one of their shares

8
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:33,971
and in exchange they will get two shares of Company A.

9
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,871
And we saw that if everyone thought that this transaction was going to happen,

10
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:44,371
theoretically, whatever A is trading at, B should trade at twice that

11
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:50,350
because people know that, when the transaction happens, they will be able to trade in a "B"

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,254
for two of these "A" shares. Now, what happens in a situation

13
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:59,597
Or, why would a situation happen where B doesn't trade at twice of A?

14
00:00:59,597 --> 00:01:05,294
So this is the theoretical, "trading twice of A," so this is two times A.

15
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:12,373
What happens if it doesn't trade there? What happens if B's shares are trading

16
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:19,971
a little bit lower there? Well that might be the case, because some people don't think that

17
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:25,186
the transaction is going to happen, so they're not willing to pay that full premium for B.

18
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:30,325
But let's say that this were to happen, and you are working at some type of a hedge fund . . .

19
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:33,638
that has some type of a model-- maybe it's a mathmatical model, maybe you have some type

20
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:38,793
of shady information-- you know for a fact, you are 100% certain

21
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:45,325
that this transaction is going to close, and it's definitely going to close with these terms: 2 million

22
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:49,121
shares of "A" in exchange for 1 million shares of "B."

23
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:56,610
Now, your temptation might be . . . why don't I just buy shares of B, because they will go up.

24
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,632
But what if the whole market goes down? What if the stock of A goes down like this?

25
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:07,028
Then two times A will also go down. So you don't want to just buy the stock of B thinking

26
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:12,666
it is going to go up, because if the transaction is really going to happen, B is just going to track

27
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,912
two times the price of A.
