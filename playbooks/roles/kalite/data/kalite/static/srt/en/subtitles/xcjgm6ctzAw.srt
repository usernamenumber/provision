1
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:06,334
In 1832, mathematician, Carl Gauss,

2
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:08,700
and physics professor, Wilhelm Weber,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,942
designed a system which allowed them to communicate

4
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:14,005
at a distance while they worked on their experiments –

5
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:18,241
connecting the observatory with the physical laboratory.

6
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:20,606
They solved a really important problem,

7
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:22,868
which was more of a puzzle:

8
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:25,047
how to send all letters of the alphabet

9
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:28,100
using one circuit – or a line.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,560
And their system used a galvanometer,

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,407
since it was known that electric current, passing through

12
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:35,719
a coil, creates a magnetic field pointing through

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,086
the center of the loop, which could deflect a needle.

14
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:42,047
But instead of merely moving a needle at a distance,

15
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:44,922
their system used a switch which could reverse

16
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:48,798
the direction of current instantly.

17
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,409
This would cause the magnetic field

18
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:52,349
around the coil to reverse,

19
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:55,918
and the needle would deflect either to the right or left,

20
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:58,268
depending on the direction of current –

21
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:02,035
thus, giving them two different signaling events –

22
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:05,927
or 'symbols' – right or left deflection.

23
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:08,666
Most importantly, he assigned shorter

24
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,913
symbols for the most common letters.

25
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:14,658
[For instance,] 'A' was a single right deflection.

26
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,384
And 'E' was a single left deflection.

27
00:01:17,384 --> 00:01:20,406
And he used the longer codes for less common letters,

28
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:25,501
such as 'K,' which was three right deflections.

29
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,658
And at the time, the speed of transmission

30
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:33,119
was around nine letters per minute.

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,656
All the needle telegraphs which followed

32
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:38,079
suffered from a similar limitation –

33
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,287
and it was an engineering problem.

34
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:44,209
The 'signaling rate' was slow.

35
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,900
Now the the signaling rate was the

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,182
number of deflections per minute

37
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:51,429
which could be accurately transmitted and received.

38
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:53,590
And if you squished signaling events together,

39
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,101
the receiver would get confused, due to jitter –

40
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:57,779
resulting in errors –

41
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:01,395
similar to how sustained notes on a piano will bleed

42
00:02:01,395 --> 00:02:06,425
together and become less recognizable – if you play rapidly.

43
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:08,454
And over time, the signaling rate

44
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:11,023
was incrementally improved.

45
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,368
One improvement was to add

46
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:15,916
a small permanent magnet to the outside of the coil.

47
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,689
This helped pull the needle back to

48
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,621
neutral position, after each deflection.

49
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:22,778
And these designs led to a wide range of

50
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:26,613
needle telegraphs, which were deployed across Europe.

51
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,026
The Electric Telegraph Company

52
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:32,201
was the first public telegraph company.

53
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:35,608
It was formed, in 1846, after its owners purchased

54
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:39,339
the key needle-telegraph patents at the time.

55
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,633
But the speed of these various needle telegraphs

56
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:50,316
never surpassed around 60 letters per minute –

57
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:57,097
as each needle couldn't signal much faster than

58
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:59,829
one deflection per second.

59
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,392
And initially, the company billed customers

60
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,587
based on single messages –

61
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:07,269
which could hold up to twenty words –

62
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,822
which is about the length of a 'tweet.'

63
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:13,579
And by 1848, the cost of sending a single message

64
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,728
from London to Edinburgh was sixteen shillings.

65
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:19,859
And this was around one week's salary for, say,

66
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:23,422
a shop owner at the time.

67
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:25,427
So this technology was initially

68
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:29,747
out of the [reach] of common people.

69
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:32,988
In the United States, the commercialization of the telegraph

70
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:36,834
was led by a portrait painter, named Samuel Morse,

71
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,092
who had followed development

72
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,130
of the needle telegraphs in Europe.

73
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,690
Morse is important. because he focused on

74
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,520
speeding up the rate at which letters could travel.

75
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,659
He did away with needles.

76
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,158
And in [1838], he initially submitted a patent

77
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:55,640
based on the idea that electric current

78
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,340
could either flow or be interrupted –

79
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,185
and interruptions could be organized to create meaning.

80
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:06,335
Though his designs on how to produce these interruptions

81
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:09,399
were complicated – involving a convoluted system of

82
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:12,264
gears, levers and electromagnets.

83
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:14,938
However, his system was greatly simplified

84
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,643
after his collaborations with Albert Vail.

85
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:21,756
This led to an iconic piece of user interface –

86
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:25,721
the simple spring-loaded lever – or 'key' –

87
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:29,218
which could be controlled with the tap of a finger.

88
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:32,532
And on the receiving end was a spring-loaded lever

89
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,560
that could be pulled and released

90
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,389
by a strong electromagnet.

91
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:49,106
To create a difference akin to the left-right deflection,

92
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:55,050
he varied the length of a key press, or the pulse width.

93
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,368
The closure of a switch for a very short time

94
00:04:58,368 --> 00:05:00,499
was called a 'dot.'

95
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:02,489
And the dot can be thought of as

96
00:05:02,489 --> 00:05:07,390
the basic unit of time in Morse code.

97
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,192
And the closure of the switch

98
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:12,672
for three units of time represented a 'dash.'

99

[SOUND OF LETTERS BEING SENT BY MORSE CODE.]

100
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:20,800
Spacing exactly right.

101
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,054
Very small, tight spaces between

102
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:25,861
the dits and dahs in a character.

Didah dit dit.

106
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:32,520
[LETTER BEING SENT BY MORSE CODE.]

107
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:35,028
And this was the source of difference

108
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:37,534
in their coding strategy.

109
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:41,873
Starting with an initial dot or dash – left or right branch –

110
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:46,170
which then leads to another dot or dash, and so on.

111
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,796
And the scheme assigned shorter symbol sequences

112
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:50,599
to more probable letters –

113
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,299
based on the letter frequencies –

114
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:55,265
which could be tabulated from books.

115
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:57,065
So nodes high up in the tree –

116
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,335
such as a single dot – represented 'E.'

117
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:03,125
A single dash represented 'T.'

118
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,469
And as we move down the tree,

119
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:08,037
we place less common letters.

120
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:13,727
And after a letter, this system inserts a three-unit pause.

121
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:16,683
Spacing between the characters in a word or group

122
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:19,411
is uniform too – but longer.

123

[LETTERS BEING SENT BY MORSE CODE.]

124
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:27,360
It's important to realize that the meaning of these messages

125
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,280
was intertwined with the timing [used when sending] them.

126
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,941
Are you wondering if proper spacing

127
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,061
is really so important?

128
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,557
Or is it no more than an extra refinement –

129
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:39,440
a nice thing to do – like neat handwriting?

130
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,184
If you think so, you're wrong. And I'll show you why.

131
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:47,525
[LETTERS BEING SENT BY MORSE CODE]

132
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:50,972
Dit for dit, and dah for dah, they match.

133
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:53,408
Only the spacing makes the difference

134
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:58,317
between one word and the other.

135
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,911
So to send the word 'Paris,'

136
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:01,747
we would first need to think of it as

137
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:06,833
'P [space] A [space] R [space] I [space] S.'

138
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,396
The signaling rate of this system was directly related

139
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,585
to the tempo of the signal.

140
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:16,372
And music analogies were used inside training videos.

141
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:21,110
What he was sending was standard test word: 'PARIS.'

142
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,837
And there you are.

143
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:26,212
Each peak is a dit – or a dah.

144
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,421
Each valley, a space.

145
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:33,606
This is excellent sending. Uniform and rhythmic.

146
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:38,666
This is an example of poor hand sending.

147
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:43,438
Same word: 'PARIS.' But look at the difference.

148
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:48,131
Irregular dits and dahs. Haphazard spacing.

149
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:51,726
No uniformity. No rhythm.

150
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:55,221
Amazingly, it was the simplicity of this keying system

151
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,169
which made it much faster

152
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:59,205
than any of the buttons and cranks

153
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:02,536
employed by the needle telegraphs in Europe.

154
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:07,546
The letter rate jumped to 135 letters per minute –

155
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:10,518
or more, with trained operators.

156
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:15,262
And on May 24th, 1844, the first successful transmission

157
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:19,727
was the message, "What hath God wrought?"

158
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:22,925
And the next day, it was reported by the New York Tribune

159
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:26,109
that, "The miracle of annihilation of space

160
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:27,892
is at length performed."

161
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:31,333
Consider that, at the time, 90% of messages

162
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,469
were still transported by horseback.

163
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:37,622
Immediately, this technology was becoming critical

164
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:40,413
to the success of [the] military, newspapers,

165
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:42,654
financial traders, crime-fighting [organizations, etc.].

166
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:46,022
Any business that relied on information

167
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:49,291
now relied on the telegraph – and Morse code.

168
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,785
By 1900, the prices had dropped

169
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:54,643
to 30 cents per message – as traffic surged

170
00:08:54,643 --> 00:09:00,509
to over 63.2 million messages sent that year.

171
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:03,907
As people begin using this system, they naturally

172
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:06,234
thought of ways to save money.

173
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:09,251
This led to popular code books that

174
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:12,707
mapped words to common sentences.

175
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:16,511
For example, 'Blade' would actually mean

176
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,882
'Please name and reserve, for myself and family,

177
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:20,964
the following accommodations.'

178
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:23,081
The telegraph companies frowned upon this,

179
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:26,250
as they were happily charging people to be verbose.

180
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,981
More letters equals more profit.

181
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:34,250
It was now clear that information was an elastic term.

182
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,840
A specific meaning was needed.

183
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,718
An obvious question remained unanswered.

184
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:41,952
If you are [charging to transmit] information –

185
00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:43,813
no matter the system –

186
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:47,597
how should you [charge] to be fair to everyone?

187
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:51,054
Number of letters – as a measure of information –

188
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:53,471
would no longer suffice.
