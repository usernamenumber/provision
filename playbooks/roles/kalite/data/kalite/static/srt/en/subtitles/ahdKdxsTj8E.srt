1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,710
We're asked to simplify 5x
squared plus 8x minus 3 plus

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,390
2x squared minus 7x plus 13x.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,830
So really, all we have to do
is we have to combine like

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,490
terms-- terms that have x raised
to the same power.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,140
And the first thing we can do,
we can actually get rid of

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,170
these parentheses right here,
because we have this whole

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,470
expression, and then we're
adding it to this whole

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:23,980
expression.

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,890
The parentheses really don't
change our order

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,230
of operations here.

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,870
So let me just rewrite it once
without the parentheses.

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:41,410
So we have 5x squared plus 8x
minus 3 plus 2x squared.

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,190
If this was a minus then we'd
have to distribute the

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,790
negative sign, but it's not.

16
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,775
So plus 2x squared minus
7x plus 13x.

17
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:52,670
Now let's just look at the
different terms that have

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,850
different degrees of x.

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,170
Let's start with the x squared
terms. So you have a 5x

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,570
squared term here and you have a
2x squared term right there.

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,235
So 5 of something plus 2 of that
same something is going

22
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:05,480
to be 7 of that something.

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,080
So that's going to
be 7x squared.

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,420
And then let's look at
the x terms here.

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,970
So we have an 8x right there.

26
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,300
We have a minus 7x.

27
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,900
And then we have a plus 13x.

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,240
So if you have 8 of something
minus 7 of something, you're

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,700
just going to have 1
of that something.

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,400
And then if you add 14 of
that something more,

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,330
you're going to 15.

32
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,910
So this is going
to be plus 15x.

33
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,980
8x minus 7x-- oh, sorry.

34
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,310
You're going to have 14x.

35
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,800
8 minus 7 is 1 plus 13 is 14.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,655
Plus 14x.

37
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:42,280
That's these three terms.
8x minus 7x plus 13x.

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,550
And then finally, you have a
negative 3-- or minus 3,

39
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,580
depending on how you
want to view it.

40
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,600
And that's the only
constant term.

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
You could say it's x
times x to the 0.

42
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,320
But it's a constant term.

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,690
It's not be multiplied by x.

44
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,590
And that's the only one
there, so minus 3.

45
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,070
And we've simplified it
as far as we can go.

46
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,750
We are done.

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:00,800
