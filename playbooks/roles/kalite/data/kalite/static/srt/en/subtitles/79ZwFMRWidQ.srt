1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:08,690
Problem number 15, and we have two triangles.

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,810
So let's see, we have one triangle here,

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,990
one triangle like this.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,670
We have another triangle that looks fairly similar.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,010
I don't know if they actually are similar.

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,040
I haven't read the problem yet.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,400
At least in the drawing,

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,400
they've drawn them to look fairly similar.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:35,430
Then they tell us that this is triangle ABC.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,710
This is triangle DEF.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,030
We know that this is 8.

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,310
This is 5. This is x degrees.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:54,070
This is also x degrees. This is 5.

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,400
Then they tell us that this is y degrees,

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,180
and that this is y degrees.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,000
Now let's read the problem.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,660
If y is equal to 60 in triangle DEF above,

18
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,960
how much greater

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,340
is the perimeter of ABC than the perimeter of DEF?

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,560
So y is equal to 60, right?

21
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,120
So what is this angle up here?

22
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,720
Well if we know that these two are the base angles--

23
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,430
well actually, we know 60, 60.

24
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,750
So what's this top angle going to be?

25
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,490
Well this is an equilateral triangle, right?

26
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,670
This also has to be equal to 60.

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,990
My brain's malfunctioning.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,910
So if all the angles are the same,

29
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,770
then all the sides are the same as well, right?

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,020
It's 5 and 5.

31
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,180
That's an equilateral triangle.

32
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,900
Then the perimeter is 5 plus 5 plus 5, is 15.

33
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,310
This problem, we don't know the x angles,

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,350
but we know that they're equal.

35
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,340
So if these two base angles are equal--

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,450
we know from geometry class that,of course--

37
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,060
the sides are also equal.

38
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,030
So if this side is 8,this side is also 8.

39
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,250
So the perimeter here is what?

40
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,020
8 plus 8 is 16 plus 5 is 21.

41
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,310
They want to know how much greater

42
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,840
is the perimeter of this triangle than this triangle?

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,980
So 21 minus 15 is 6. That is choice C.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,060
Next problem. Right? Yeah, choice C.

45
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,350
Problem number 16,

46
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,930
if x and y are positive, consecutive, odd integers

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,060
where y is greater than x,

48
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:02,800
which of the following is equal to y squared minus x squared?

49
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,480
So x and y are positive,consecutive, odd integers,

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,700
and y is greater than x.

51
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,510
So that means that y is equal to x plus what?

52
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,480
It's equal to x plus 2.

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,900
If they were consecutive just integers,

54
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,920
then y would be equal to x plus 1.

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,040
It would be 1 more than x.

56
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,110
But since we know that they're both odd,

57
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,410
and y is the next larger odd number--

58
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,490
the difference between any two odd numbers is 2--

59
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,230
so y is going to be 2 more than x.

60
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,840
If x is 5, then y is 7.

61
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,250
Consecutive, odd integers,if x is 3, y is 5.

62
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,930
y is 2 more than x.

63
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,530
So we know y is equal to x plus 2.

64
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,270
So they want us to kind of rewrite this expression.

65
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,960
Well we know from algebra class

66
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:58,110
we can factor this as y plus x times y minus x, right?

67
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,050
And then what is y plus x?

68
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,050
Actually, we don't even have to do this.

69
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,050
We don't even have to factor it.

70
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,340
We know what y is equal to, right?

71
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,820
y is equal to x plus 2.

72
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,310
So that is equal to x plus 2 squared minus x squared.

73
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,590
This is equal to-- we just multiply it out--

74
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,640
x squared plus 4x plus 4.

75
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,880
That's this term. Now we minus x squared.

76
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,940
So this cancels out with this,and we're left with 4x plus 4,

77
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,590
which is choice E.

78
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,060
Whenever I see something like this,

79
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,460
my first temptation is to factor it out.

80
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,260
You could have done it,

81
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,070
and then you could have substituted it back in.

82
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,960
But you didn't even have to do that.

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,250
Image: clear image,invert colors.

84
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,960
It's actually 6:30 in the morning after Thanksgiving.

85
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,610
You've got to appreciate my discipline.

86
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,250
All right, problem number 17.

87
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,280
My wife's actually a medical resident

88
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,640
and she had to work 36 hours yesterday.

89
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,010
Then she came home, essentially passed out,

90
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,200
missed Thanksgiving, everything,

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,590
and then she just went to work again.

92
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,280
She has like a 12-hour shift, it's crazy.

93
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,750
She only has a year left and I look forward to that.

94
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,980
But there might be fewer math videos once

95
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
I have my wife back.

96
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,000
But anyway, back to Math.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,780
Problem number 17, in the xy plane,

98
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,040
line l passes through the origin

99
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,850
and is perpendicular to the line.

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:33,530
So l is perpendicular to the line 4x plus y is equal to k,

101
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,460
and l passes through the origin,

102
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:45,140
through 0,0-- that's the origin-- where k is a constant.

103
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:51,780
If the two lines intersect at the point t, t plus 1,

104
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,340
what is the value of t?

105
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,700
So first of all,

106
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,780
we know this line is perpendicular to this line.

107
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,990
So what does perpendicular tell us?

108
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,890
Perpendicular says whatever the slope was of this line,

109
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,160
the slope of this line would be the negative inverse.

110
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,470
So let's figure out what the slope of this line is.

111
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,180
So we know that 4x plus y is equal to k.

112
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,720
So y is equal to minus 4x plus k.

113
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,310
Now this is kind of familiar,y equals mx plus b format.

114
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,450
So the slope of this line is minus 4.

115
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,330
The slope equals minus 4.

116
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,240
So the slope of this line is minus 4.

117
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,140
So what is the slope of l?

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,740
Well l is perpendicular to this line.

119
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,160
So we know that

120
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,040
l is going to have the negative inverse of this slope.

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,290
So the negative inverse of minus 4 is--

122
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,820
well it'll become positive, and you take the inverse.

123
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,280
The slope of l is 1/4.

124
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,770
We also know that l goes through the origin.

125
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,680
So its y-intercept is 0.

126
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,080
So we know the equation of l.

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,840
We know that the equation of l is y is equal to 1/4 x.

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,830
We know there's no plus b,because it goes through 0, 0.

129
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,640
If you didn't believe me, you can put 0, 0 in here

130
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,360
and then solve for b.

131
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,940
You'll get 0 equals 0 plus b.

132
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,770
So b is 0.

133
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,100
But anyway, so this is l.

134
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,350
We've solved for the equation for l.

135
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,760
Now they tell us that we intersect-- where was the problem?

136
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,500
I lost track of the page--

137
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,540
we intersect at the point t, t plus 1.

138
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,240
They want to figure out what t is.

139
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,860
So when x is t, y is t plus 1.

140
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,960
So let's see, so y is t plus 1,

141
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:00,250
so t plus 1 is equal to 1/4. Then, x is t.

142
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,160
I just substituted t and t plus 1 for x and y.

143
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,850
Now we just solve.

144
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,640
Let's see, if we subtract 1/4 t from both sides--

145
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,020
let me finish this problem up here--

146
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,640
we subtract 1/4 t from both sides.

147
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,470
We get 3/4 t plus 1 is equal to 0,right?

148
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,420
I just subtracted 1/4 t from this 1t. So you get 3/4 t.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,230
Subtract 1 from both sides,

150
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,160
you get 3/4 t is equal to minus 1.

151
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,080
Then you just multiply both sides times the inverse, 4/3.

152
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,650
So t-- this cancels out,of course--

153
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,270
t is equal to minus 4/3.

154
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,800
And what is my choice there?

155
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,810
Oh, there I go. Choice number A. I got scared.

156
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,380
I looked at the wrong problem,I didn't see my choice.

157
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,460
I thought maybe I did it wrong.

158
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,490
Choice number A.

159
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,580
And I will do problem 18 in the next video.

160
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,680
I'll see you soon.
