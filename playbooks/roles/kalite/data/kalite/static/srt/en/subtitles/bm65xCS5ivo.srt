1
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:05,106
So you're probably feeling pretty comfortable with the diagram of the heart,

2
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:08,705
but let me just go ahead and label a few things, 
just to make sure we're all on the same page.

3
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:11,603
Blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle,

4
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:16,136
then it goes to the lungs and from the left atrium to the left ventricle.

5
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:19,343
That's usually the flow of blood.

6
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:24,269
One of the things that keeps the blood flowing in the right direction is the valves.

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,100
Two of the valves I'm gonna name, 
I'm giving them new names,

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,837
something slightly different from what we've been referring to them by.

9
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:35,038
These are the atrioventricular valves.

10
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:38,917
You can take a guess as to which ones I'm referring to.

11
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:45,204
Atrioventricular valves are the two valves between the atria and the ventricles.

12
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:50,137
One will be the tricuspid valve and the other the mitral valve.

13
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:57,035
Just to orientate us: 
this is the tricuspid (T) and this is our mitral (M).

14
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:02,534
The atrioventricular valves, if you look at them, 
they're both kind of facing downwards.

15
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:08,437
One of the things you might be wondering is
'How is it that they aren't just flopping back and forth?'

16
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:12,209
These valves in particular have a very interesting strategy,

17
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:18,703
they're actually tethered to the walls.

18
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:25,072
They're held down here, like that.

19
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:31,135
They have on the other end of those tethers a little muscle.

20
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:34,048
This makes perfect sense if you think about it.

21
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:40,003
The ventricles are very strong, right?
We know the ventricles are really really strong.

22
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:47,874
If the ventricles are squeezing, there's a good chance the blood is gonna shoot up in any direction it can go.

23
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:58,537
It's gonna go back perhaps through the mitral valve, it can go there, or it might go through the tricuspid valve.

24
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:06,569
The reason that it won't, is that these papillary muscles are basically sending out little life lines, these chordae tendinae,

25
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,770
to keep the valve from flipping backwards.

26
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:17,003
So these chordae tendinae, 
these cords are important for that reason.

27
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:21,749
They keep the valve from flipping backwards.

28
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:26,835
These are all the chordae tendinae 
and these are the papillary muscles.

29
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:36,379
These are particularly important for when you're trying to make sure that ventricles don't screw up the valves.

30
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:44,436
Let's say that by accident our ventricle was just too strong, too powerful, let's say it broke one of these cords.

31
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:46,500
Let's say it broke this one right here.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,813
That's because our ventricle was just forcing too much blood back and it just snapped the cord.

33
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:54,140
What would happen?

34
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:01,752
This would basically start flipping back and forth,
it would flip this way and this way.

35
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:05,671
On the next heartbeat, blood would start going the wrong direction,

36
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:10,074
because this valve is not able to maintain a nice tight seal.

37
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:15,270
Blood would basically go this way when it wasn't supposed to.

38
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,877
All of a sudden our flow of blood is going in the wrong direction.

39
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:25,934
The chordae tendinae and the papillary muscles do a really important job in preventing that from happening.

40
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:28,587
Let's move our attention to another area.

41
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:38,104
Let's focus on this right here, 
which is the interventricular septum.

42
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:40,438
You can think of a septum as a wall.

43
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:43,269
Interventricular septum.

44
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:48,275
This interventricular septum, the one thing I want to point out, which is maybe fairly obvious,

45
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,834
when you look at it, you might think, you didn't have to say it, it's pretty obvious,

46
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:57,704
this area is really thin and this area is really thick by comparison, right?

47
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:02,034
The two areas are not equal in size, this is much thicker.

48
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:08,612
The reason I bring that up is because the first area, in blue, is called the membranous part.

49
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:11,969
It's literally like a membrane.

50
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:17,336
The bottom, the red part, is the muscular part.
This is the strong muscular part.

51
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:22,413
You have two different areas in that interventricular septum,
the wall between the ventricles.

52
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:27,076
One of the interesting things about the membranous part in particular,

53
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:32,831
is that a lot of babies are born with holes in that membranous part.

54
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:36,375
When I say a lot I don't mean the majority of babies by any means.

55
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:44,036
But one of the most common defects would be that you would have a communication between these two.

56
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:52,701
So blood would flow from the left ventricle, into a place it shouldn't be going, the right ventricle.

57
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:56,645
Blood could flow through those holes and that is a problem.

58
00:04:56,645 --> 00:05:04,505
That is called a VSD. You might hear that term at some point, so I just wanna point out where that happens.

59
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:11,501
While I'm writing this, you can take a guess at what this might stand for.

60
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:20,071
Ventricular Septal (septal just means wall) Defect.

61
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:27,600
A VSD is most common in the membranous part, 
more so than the muscular part.

62
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:35,467
Let's move on again to one final thing I wanna point out, 
I wanna zoom in on the wall.

63
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:42,769
Here in this grey box I'm gonna highlight what's going on in this wall, how many layers there are in this wall.

64
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:48,676
I'm gonna draw a rectangle to correspond to the little rectangle I drew on the heart itself.

65
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:54,503
There are 3 layers to the heart muscle.

66
00:05:54,503 --> 00:06:00,200
I'm gonna go through all three layers,
we'll start on the inside and work our way out.

67
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,047
On the inside you have what's called the endocardium.

68
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:10,104
I'm gonna draw the endocardium all the way around here,
it goes all the way around the valves.

69
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:14,437
So you've already learned that the valves got endocardium.

70
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:21,475
It goes around the ventricle and, as I showed you in the beginning, also around the atrium.

71
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:26,942
It goes all the way up and covers both the left and right side.

72
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:35,584
The endocardium is very similar in many ways to the inner lining of the blood vessels.

73
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:38,269
It's a really thin layer, not a very thick layer.

74
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:42,903
It's the layer all the red blood cells are bumping up against.

75
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:50,734
When the red blood cells are entering the chambers of the heart, the part they're gonna see is the endocardium.

76
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:56,082
This is what it looks like, this is that green layer all the way around that I've drawn now.

77
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:01,255
If I was to draw a blown up version, it might look like this.

78
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,171
It's a few cell layers thick.

79
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:09,138
On the inside you have some red blood cells bumping along.

80
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:15,770
This is one RBC,this is another one and they would bump into that endocardium.

81
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,270
If you go a little bit deeper than the endocardium, 
what do you get to next?

82
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,437
Next is the myocardium.

83
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:30,370
That would be the biggest chunk of our wall.

84
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,586
It would look something like this.

85
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:38,745
The myocardium you can kind of see the shape, 
just without me pointing it out,

86
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:42,438
because it's the most common part of this entire thing, right?

87
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:48,336
This is our myocardium.

88
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:54,738
Let me go back and actually label the endocardium as well.

89
00:07:54,738 --> 00:08:03,467
Just notice that these words are all pretty similar. 
Myo- means muscle.

90
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:06,148
While I'm on the myocardium, 
let me just point out one more thing.

91
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:10,905
The myocardium is where all of the contractile muscle is gonna be.

92
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:12,970
That's where a lot of the work is being done.

93
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,588
It's also where a lot of energy is being used up.

94
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:23,376
When the heart needs oxygen, it's usually the myocardium,
because that's the part that's doing all of the work.

95
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:27,046
Now on the other side of the myocardium,
what do we have on the outside?

96
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:29,380
We have a layer called the pericardium.

97
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,703
Let me try to draw that for you.

98
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:34,768
The pericardium is something like this,
kind of a thin layer.

99
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:39,911
The interesting thing about pericardium is 
that there are actually two layers to it.

100
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:42,369
It's actually something like this.

101
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:50,083
Where you have two layers, an inner and an outer layer and between the two layers you literally have a gap.

102
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,975
There's a gap right there.

103
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:59,405
In that gap you might have a little bit of fluid, 
but it's not actually cells.

104
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:04,213
I guess that's the biggest point,
it's not cells, it's just a little bit of fluid.

105
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:10,567
So this whole thing is called the pericardium.

106
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:16,436
You might be wondering
'How do you get a layer that has a gap within it?'

107
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:20,970
Let me try to show you what happens in a fetus.

108
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,134
Let's say you have a little fetus heart, a tiny little heart like this.

109
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:27,370
It gets a little bit bigger, like this.

110
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,169
And finally it gets into an adult heart, something like that.

111
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,249
This would be the adult heart, right?

112
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:40,169
Well, at the same time the heart is growing, 
you also have a sac, almost like a balloon.

113
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:48,503
This balloon begins to envelope the heart.

114
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:50,968
This growing heart grows right into the balloon.

115
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:54,635
This balloon starts going around it, like that.

116
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,769
You'll get something like this.

117
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,203
Eventually, as the heart gets really big,
you get something like this.

118
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:08,671
You basically have this inner layer of the balloon that's not even looking like a balloon anymore, it's very flat.

119
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:15,217
Then it folds back on itself, like that, and it comes all the way around.

120
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:19,984
Now you can see why even though it's continuous, 
I mean, it's not like it breaks, it is continuous here,

121
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:28,619
you can see how, if you were just looking at at chunk of it, like we're looking at right here,

122
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:32,185
you can see how it would look like a pancake.

123
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:38,685
On our heart it literally would be something like this,
a very thin kind of pancake.

124
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:44,122
I'm not doing a very good job making it look thin,
but you can imagine what it is,

125
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:47,817
what it could look like if I was to zoom in on it,
basically something like that.

126
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:56,257
You have two layers that are just turned in on themselves.
Both layers together are called the pericardium.

127
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:59,618
There are actually separate names for the two layers.

128
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:05,181
For example, the layer that's kind of hugging up against the heart, this layer that I'm drawing now,

129
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:09,250
this layer is called the visceral pericardium.

130
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,420
So you call that the visceral pericardium.

131
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:21,616
The name visceral, this right here would be visceral, the reason it's called visceral is because viscera means organs.

132
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:24,517
So that's called the visceral pericardium.

133
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:31,585
This outer layer, the one I'm drawing now,
is called the parietal pericardium.

134
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:35,683
That's the layer on the outside.

135
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:41,918
Let me label that as well as this guy,
that would be the parietal pericardium.

136
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:47,568
Now you can actually see the layers of the heart, 
the endocardium, myocardium and pericardium.

137
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:52,816
And to throw you a curveball, 
as I'm pretty sure you can handle it,

138
00:11:52,816 --> 00:12:00,582
this visceral pericardium, another name for it, 
because you might see it sometime, is the epicardium.

139
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:02,893
Sometimes you might see it, the epicardium.

140
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:06,718
Don't get thrown of, it's really just the visceral pericardium.

141
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:10,718
It's just the outermost layer of the heart before you get to the parietal pericardium.
