1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,390
We're on problem 205.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,590
In the table above,

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,210
what is the number of green marbles in jar R? OK.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:21,250
Let's see, they give us a table, they have jars P, Q, and R.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:31,540
They say number of red, is x, y, and x.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:41,640
And they tell us the number of green is y, z, and z.

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:52,410
And then they tell us the total is 80, 120, and 160.

8
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,030
And they say, in the table above,

9
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,800
what is the number of green marbles in jars?

10
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,350
So we need to solve for z.

11
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,010
So what we have here is three variables and

12
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,640
we have three unknowns. We actually have three equations

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,550
because we know that the red plus the green is equal to

14
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,000
the total for any one of the jars.

15
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:22,530
y plus z is equal to 120 and x plus z is equal to 160.

16
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,370
So let's just try to solve this equation.

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,940
So let's try to get everything-- I don't know,

18
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,620
what do we want to cancel out first?

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,160
What happens if we subtract that equation from this one?

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,060
Let me write that one over.So that's x plus y is equal to 80.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,020
I just rewrote that column down here.

22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,210
Now, if we were to subtract this from that--

23
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,490
let's just well multiply it by negative 1.

24
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,550
So, minus x, minus y, minus 80. And now let's just add them.

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,380
We get 0 plus z minus y, so we get z minus y is equal to--

26
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,900
what's 160 minus 80? Well that's just 80.

27
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,690
And now, this is interesting, we have z minus y equals 80,

28
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,080
and z plus y is equal to 120. So I think we're pretty close.

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,710
Let's write that.

30
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,010
So we could write this equation-- I'll write it in yellow.

31
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,460
z plus y-- I just switched the order-- is equal to 120.

32
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,060
But, in the back of my mind, I'm like,

33
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,390
well, I have to do is figure out these.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,090
If I can figure out these as fast as possible,all the better.

35
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:35,680
Add these two equations. 2z plus 0 is equal to 240.

36
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,000
z is equal to 120.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And that's the number of green marbles in jar R. 120.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,670
And that is not one of the choices.

39
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,050
Where did I make a mistake?

40
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,490
I often make a mistake right near the end.

41
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,020
Let's see. x plus z.

42
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,020
Let me see. X plus y is equal to 80.

43
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,130
y plus z is equal to 120. x plus z is equal to 160.

44
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,950
Now, I took this equation-- no, I took this one and

45
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,930
I multiplied it by negative 1 and put it here.

46
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,010
Minus x,minus y,is equal to minus 80. Then I added these two.

47
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,000
So the x's cancel out and you're left with z minus y is

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,420
equal to 80.

49
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,110
And then, this equation says y plus z is equal to 120--

50
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,030
oh, I see my mistake. You see, I made it right at the end.

51
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,050
z minus y is equal to 80. z plus y is equal to 120.

52
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,460
80 plus 120 is not 240. 80 plus 120 is 200.

53
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,050
So 2z is equal to 200. z is equal to 100.

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,610
Boneheaded mistake. So the answer is 100. D.

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,010
Next question. Question 206.

56
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,200
In the circle above, PQ-- let me draw the circle above.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,670
This is the circle above.

58
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's see, in the circle above, PQ-- OK

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,030
they then draw diameter. Let me draw diameter as well.

60
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,400
Because I want to be accurate.

61
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:24,100
So that's diameter and they labelled this as O and R.

62
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,240
And they say PQ-- so they have this other line up here that

63
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,600
this is parallel to the diameter. So let me draw it up here.

64
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,070
Maybe it looks something like this. That's parallel.

65
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,300
And they call this point P and this point Q.

66
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,890
And then they have another line they say is a 35 degree angle

67
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,360
Let me see if I can draw that.

68
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,880
You have a line that goes from here to here.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,780
And they tell us that this angle right here is 35 degrees.

70
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,470
In the circle above, PQ is parallel to diameter OR.

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:12,060
And OR has length 18. What is the length of minor arc PQ?

72
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:19,750
Fascinating. So, they want to know what this is.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,960
So, we can figure out the circumference of this circle.

74
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
The circumference, we know its diameter.

75
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,150
It's just going to be the diameter times pi.

76
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,070
So, we already know that the circumference of the circle is

77
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,190
18 pi or 2 times the radius times pi. But same thing.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,610
Now, in order to figure out this arc length,

79
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,600
what would be useful--

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,230
and I don't know yet if I can figure it out,

81
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,030
is if we could figure out this angle right here.

82
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,070
If we could figure out this angle right here, we'd be done.

83
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,000
We could easily figure it out because that

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,570
angle as a proportion of 360

85
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,860
would be the same relative proportion of the total radius.

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,380
So let's see if we can figure out what that angle is.

87
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,010
Just given the information they've given us.

88
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,860
This angle here's is going to be 35 degrees.

89
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,320
And how did I know that?

90
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,670
Well, those are those are opposite inside angles.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,900
Let me see.

92
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,580
What matters is-- let me think about it a little bit.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,620
And this is on the circle. Oh, well this is interesting.

94
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,370
We should use the information. This is a circle.

95
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,090
So, what is the length of that right there?

96
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:43,530
Well, if the diameter is 18 then the radius is 9, right?

97
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,080
If that length is 9, than this length is also going to be 9.

98
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,000
And if that length is 9-- oh this is interesting.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,640
This length is 9, this length is also 9.

100
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,680
That length also has to be 9.

101
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,050
They're both radiuses of the circle which tells us that this,

102
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,030
right here, is kind of an isosceles triangle on its side.

103
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,600
It looks like that.

104
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,120
Where these sides are equal. They're both equal to 9.

105
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,370
So, if this is a 35 degree angle, then this, right here,

106
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,450
has to be a 35 degree angle as well.I know you can read it.

107
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,000
Because the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.

108
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,730
I could redraw it like this. This is an interesting problem.

109
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,330
So, if we know that length is equal to that length,

110
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,190
we know that angle is equal to that angle.

111
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,090
So, then we know that this angle right here

112
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,750
has also got to be equal to 35.

113
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,940
This is useful because if this angle is 35

114
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,000
and this angle is 35, what is this entire angle?

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,010
What is that entire angle?

116
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,080
Well that entire angle-- let me draw it up here.

117
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,010
So that's the PQ side. So, this is also 35.

118
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:04,080
So this entire angle right here is 70. 35 plus 35.

119
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,060
I should have drawn this a lot bigger.

120
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,310
So,this right here is 70 degrees. And how do I figure it out?

121
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,850
I figure out this 35 because this is an isosceles triangle.

122
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,040
And I figured out that this is 35.

123
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,050
I figured out that this is right here is 35 because it's an

124
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,790
opposite angle from a transversal between two parallel lines.

125
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,970
Because that line is parallel to that line.

126
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,000
So, that was all pretty useful.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,660
Now, what if there was only a way to figure out

128
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,700
what this angle was?

129
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,920
Because if we know this angle and this angle,

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
then we know for sure this angle.

131
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,040
Well, I'm going to use the same argument.

132
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,030
This line right here, this is a radius of the triangle.

133
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,970
So this side right here is also 9. That side.

134
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,070
so, if we know that this side is equal to this side--

135
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,440
let me draw the triangle that I'm talking about now,

136
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,040
because I think this is an important problem.

137
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,540
So, I'm trying to figure out the value of

138
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,000
this upside down triangle.

139
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,020
And I'll label it so you know what I'm talking about.

140
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,650
So,this is P.This is Q. And this is the center of the circle.

141
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,130
And we know that the side is 9, this side is 9.

142
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,100
And we just figured out that this angle right here is 70.

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,080
This was 35 plus another 35.

144
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,630
Once again, another isosceles triangle.

145
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,430
If this side is equal to that side,

146
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,020
that this angle is equal to this angle.

147
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,040
So, this angle also has to be equal to 70.

148
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,430
And now,if we know two angles of a triangle,we know the third

149
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,200
This has to be-- [PHONE RINGING] I'm on a roll.

150
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,210
I'm not going to answer the phone. Oh I think it's my wife.

151
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,080
I'm going to call her back right after this.

152
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,130
So what was I doing? I lost my train of thought.

153
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,100
I was on a roll.

154
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,380
If this angle is 70 degrees, this angle is 70 degrees,

155
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,180
then this angle has to be what?

156
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:01,450
70 plus 70 plus x is equal to 180 degrees.

157
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:08,690
140 plus x is equal to 40 degrees. Sorry, is equal to 180.

158
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,260
My brain was skipping ahead. x is equal to 40 degrees. OK.

159
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,260
So that angle is 40 degrees which is the same thing as

160
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,030
that angle.

161
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,530
So the length of-- so let's go back to the problem.

162
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,450
We have to figure out what this arc length is.

163
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:30,250
So,this angle,which is 40 over all the degrees in the circle,

164
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,330
over 360, is going to be equal to this arc length--

165
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,490
let's just call it x--

166
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,570
over the circumference of the whole circle. And we know that

167
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,860
the circumference of the full circle is 18 pi.

168
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,000
Let's see if we can simplify this.

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,070
40 goes into 360-- that's 1/9. So to this becomes 1 over 9.

170
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:59,120
Then we could cross multiply and get 9x is equal to 18 pi.

171
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:06,000
x is equal to, 18 pi divided by 9, is equal to 2 pi.

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,380
And, luckily, that's one of the choices. It's choice A.

173
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,880
See you in the next video.

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,090
I now have to call my wife.
