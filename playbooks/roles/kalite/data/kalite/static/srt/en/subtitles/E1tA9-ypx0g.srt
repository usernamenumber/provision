1
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:08,747
'Only here colours do everything

2
00:00:08,747 --> 00:00:12,270
and by its simplification a grandeur style do things

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:19,763
is to be suggestive here first of rest or of sleep in general in a world looking at the picture or to rest the brain

4
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:21,336
or raven the imagination.'

5
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:24,961
So the passage that you've just read came from a letter

6
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:29,658
Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo and it actually refers to the first version of this painting.

7
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:35,654
But the passage that stands out for me in this painting 'colour has to do everything'.

8
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:38,734
It applies equally well to this painting and when I think about that phrase,

9
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:44,245
I think about a radical idea that happens in the end of the ninteenth century

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,604
with painting in the formal elements of colour, the lines, the shapes.

11
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:54,814
Painters began to explore the way that these elements can be expressive on their own.

12
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:59,614
When you are talking about this root of abstraction itself, so it's not that this is the representative.

13
00:00:59,614 --> 00:01:04,077
It's that formal qualities of painting itself can have its own experiential aspect.

14
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:09,972
Rather like music which is pure tone, colour also, form also could have an emotional value.

15
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:15,022
That is right! That the lines that make up this painting, that the sense of solidity, that the colours,

16
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:22,660
that the harmonies between the colours, the relationship of the shapes, that these things could suggest an idea

17
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:29,258
or emotion. Regardless of what they represent. Moving away from the idea of art copying the real world.

18
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:36,513
And in this case the idea that Van Gogh wanted to represent was one of peacefulness and harmony, and repose.

19
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,889
For so many people, they think about van Gogh's brushwork and they think about his biography.

20
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:48,822
But listening to artist's own words, you realize that his intention was on the structural qualities and emotional qualities of colour.

21
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:55,981
And although we can see his brushwork and the pillows where the paint almost seems to describe the puffiness of the pillows.

22
00:01:55,981 --> 00:02:03,597
And even other is the sense of space tilting up when rushing backward too quickly and things seeming slightly askew.

23
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:11,481
I do get that sense from the painting of Van Gogh trying to create a world here in this yellow house in Arles Lamartine

24
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:21,006
moved from Paris, a place that could be the basis for a community, a place for artists to come and a place to focus on making art.

25
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:28,747
And there is something about the simplicity of the space that feels so different than the materialism and sophistication of Paris.

26
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:33,711
So this is a refuge and a deeply personal one, but he has created the space with such love and such care.

27
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:40,695
He is in a sense inviting us to feel right at home. And loving, care in a diferent way that we may normally expect.

28
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:48,758
The care that I meant was the care that is based on his observation. His experience in this room, his having touched that seat,

29
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:54,699
his having slept in that bed, his intimate experience that he has been able to convey to us with an extraordinary immediacy.

30
00:02:54,699 --> 00:03:03,590
Think for a second of the sophistication of the Paris art world and the expectation of a Parisian audience

31
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:08,965
and look at that wooden night-standard toilet table as he called it in his letter.

32
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:16,513
It looks like it was drawn by a child. It has no modulation, it has blue outer lines and the colour is otherwise flat,

33
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:22,104
the perspective doesn't make sense. I think this painting must have looked like it was made by an artist who wasn't trained properly.

34
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:28,082
And, yet his professionalism does really work through a catalogue of the styles of the ninteenth century beginning, for instance

35
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:33,364
with the art of people like Millet and moving through impressionists, and then really paying attention to

36
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:39,001
the neo-impressionist people like Seurat and here finding a very direct application of paint

37
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:45,456
that I think for Van Gogh felt absolutely authentic. Authenticity is the keyword I think for a lot of artists

38
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:50,852
including Gaugin and at the end of the eighteen 80s and the beginning of the eighteen 90s.

39
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:56,988
This idea of finding authentic experience and that being not the the experience of the city.

40
00:03:56,988 --> 00:04:02,441
This looks back to some of the ideas that surround the works of Rysselberghe. But this is clear contrast

41
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:07,786
between the sophistication of the city and in the sense that the truth and directness of the country.

42
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:14,503
Van Gogh has been able to convey beautifully. This is a painting that is also meant to be a kind of invitation

43
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:18,298
to his friends form the North that he was hoping would come down and join him.

44
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:27,107
He has an idea of creating a rather utopian setting for artists to make art away from the city in some sort of communion with nature.

45
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:32,860
Van Gogh gives us a kind of an extraordinarily sophisticated innocence.
