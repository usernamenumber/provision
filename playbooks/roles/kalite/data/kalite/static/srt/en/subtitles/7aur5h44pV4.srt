1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,510
I've hopefully given you a bit
of a gut feeling behind where

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,180
the formula of Gibbs Free
Energy comes from.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,039
In this video I want to do
something a little bit more

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,320
rigorous and actually,
I guess you could

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,270
say derive the formula.

7
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,620
So to do that, let's just study
two systems that have

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,660
the exact same change
in entropy.

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,195
To depict that, I'll get out
our handy PV diagram.

10
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:24,790
   

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,160
What we're going to do is we're
going to compare two

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,020
systems. One that's this
perfect, reversible system and

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,860
one that's irreversible or
a spontaneous system.

14
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,020
So they're both going
to start here.

15
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,990
They're going to go from this
point on the PV diagram to

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,260
this point right here.

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,980
And before we go into exactly
what they're doing, I think

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,490
it's a good review to kind
of talk about what an

19
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,730
irreversible process and
what a reversible

20
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,120
process really is.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,920
An irreversible process is this
theoretical thing where

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,950
you have no friction, where
you're always so close to

23
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,950
equilibrium that you can
always go backwards.

24
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,004
You're always-- you can kind of
view that the reaction is

25
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,010
never really proceeding
forward or backwards.

26
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,960
Although obviously it is moving,
so it's a very-- it

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,820
actually doesn't really exist
in nature, but it's a useful

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,000
theoretical construct.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,880
So let me draw a little.

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,870
So if this is a-- I'll get
the good old pistons out.

31
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,530
So let's say this is an--
I'll do it twice.

32
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,870
So that's my irreversible
piston-- That'll be my

33
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,810
reversible, this is going
to be my irreversible.

34
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,480
Let me draw them.

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,820
OK, and let me label them.

36
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,270
So this right here is going
to be reversible.

37
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,240
And this right here is going
to be irreversible.

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,305
Or it could also be considered
spontaneous.

39
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:46,260
   

40
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,710
Using the key word.

41
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,580
That's going to matter for
Gibbs Free Energy.

42
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,740
But all spontaneous reactions
are irreversible.

43
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,870
So they're going to go from
this state to this state.

44
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,220
So in our reversible
world, we have this

45
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,900
little cap to our piston.

46
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,350
And we have our gas in here,
exerting some pressure.

47
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,470
And what we'd have is
a bunch of pebbles.

48
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,759
We have a bunch of
pebbles out here.

49
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,080
And we slowly remove the
pebbles one by one.

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,010
And as we remove the pebbles,
our piston-- or this movable

51
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,990
ceiling up here-- will
move upwards.

52
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,390
It'll move upwards.

53
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,020
So the pressure will push up,
but as we move up, we will

54
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,590
have lower and lower pressure
because the gases will bounce

55
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,110
into the surface less.

56
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,500
And we'll have a higher,
higher volume.

57
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,150
So as we move each
infinitesimally small grain of

58
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,730
sand, and we're going to do it
super slow, that we're always

59
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,600
infinitely close
to equilibrium.

60
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,270
We're going to move from this
state to this state.

61
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,470
And even better, let's view that
this is the first stage

62
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,530
of our Carnot cycle.

63
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,270
Let's say in either case, we're
on top of a reservoir.

64
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,470
So in either case, both of these
systems are on top of

65
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,980
this infinite reservoir that
has a temperature T1.

66
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,650
And what that does it keeps
the temperature constant.

67
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,140
So we're going to travel
along an isotherm.

68
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,870
Because normally if we were to
remove these things and if we

69
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,130
just allowed it to occur
adiabatically, we would

70
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,620
actually lose temperature.

71
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,360
We would actually lose
average kinetic

72
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,910
energy as work is done.

73
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,940
But in this case we have
this reservoir.

74
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,220
So heat is just going to be
transferred to my system.

75
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,510
Heat is going to
be transferred.

76
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,230
So let me call that QR.

77
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:25,490
Right?

78
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:30,250
If the reservoir wasn't here,
our temperature would go down.

79
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,940
But since we do have the
reservoir, we will constantly

80
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,220
be transferring heat.

81
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,900
And we've seen this.

82
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,410
This is just the first phase
of the Carnot cycle.

83
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,500
We'll move along an isotherm
like this.

84
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,430
This is the reversible case.

85
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,300
And the only reason why we can
even draw the state at every

86
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,590
point here is because reversible
processes are

87
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,480
quasistatic.

88
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,740
They're always infinitely
close to equilibrium.

89
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,510
And when we say reversible,
we're also saying there's no

90
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,840
friction between this little
piston in the cylinder.

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,363
That if we put a grain of sand
back, it'll go exactly to

92
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:01,260
where it was before.

93
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,890
And no energy was lost
because there was no

94
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,450
heat of friction there.

95
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,650
So this is what the graph
of the reversible

96
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,460
process would look like.

97
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,670
Now what does the graph of the
error irreversible-- Well,

98
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,110
actually no.

99
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,410
I won't draw the graph, but
let's talk about what the

100
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,050
irreversible process is
going to be like.

101
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,600
So it's going to look similar.

102
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,680
It's going to look like that.

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,760
It's going to have
its gases there.

104
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,830
But for the sake of an argument,
to get from that

105
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,810
state to that state, instead of
moving the pebbles one by

106
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,220
one, let's say I have
these big blocks.

107
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,240
And when I remove one of these
big blocks, I go from that

108
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,440
state to that state.

109
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,470
But obviously all hell
breaks loose.

110
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,280
So I'm not really defined in
this in between state.

111
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,420
But I definitely go from that
state to that state once I go

112
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,920
back to equilibrium.

113
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,420
Now the other key thing in the
irreversible process-- and

114
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,880
every real process in our world
is irreversible-- is

115
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,210
that you're going to
have friction here.

116
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,320
As this moves up, it's going to
rub against the side of the

117
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,690
container and generate
heat of friction.

118
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,980
So let me call that
heat of friction.

119
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,100
So let me ask you a question.

120
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,220
If, in this case, Q sub R had
to be added to the system to

121
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,960
maintain its temperature, what's
going to be the Q sub

122
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,200
irreversible here?

123
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,200
How much has to be added to this
system in order to keep

124
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,280
it at the constant
temperature T1?

125
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
Will it have to be more or less
than what was added to

126
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,870
the reversible system?

127
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,480
Well this guy, as this piston
moves up, he's generating some

128
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,530
of his own heat.

129
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,410
So if this was an adiabatic
process, he wouldn't lose as

130
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,210
much temperature as
this guy would.

131
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,210
So he's going to need less heat
from the reservoir in

132
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,400
order to maintain
his temperature.

133
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,760
At T1.

134
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,220
In order to get to this
point on the isotherm.

135
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,310
Remember, this irreversible
process, we don't know what

136
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,010
happens over here.

137
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,960
He might be travelling
on some crazy path.

138
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,570
In fact, we can't even define
the path, because it goes out

139
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,580
of equilibrium.

140
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,670
So it's going to be
some crazy thing.

141
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,830
But we know it pops back on the
PV diagram right there.

142
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,810
But because it's generating some
of its own heat from the

143
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,255
friction, it's going to need
less heat from the reservoir.

144
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:09,270
So let me write that down.

145
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,050
The heat absorbed by the
reversible process is going to

146
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,050
be greater than the heat
absorbed by the

147
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,180
irreversible process.

148
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,790
And that's because the
irreversible process is

149
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,760
generating friction.

150
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,960
Fair enough.

151
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,690
Now what is the change in
entropy for both systems?

152
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,500
Well they both started here.

153
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,720
And they both ended here.

154
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,520
And entropy is a
state variable.

155
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,220
So the change in entropy for
the reversible process is

156
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:47,150
going to be equal to the change
in entropy for the

157
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,650
irreversible process.

158
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,290
They're both going from
there to there.

159
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,460
And obviously the entropy
has changed.

160
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,850
We're going from one state
to another state.

161
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,620
And the entropy, well I won't
go too much into it.

162
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,720
But let's ask another
question.

163
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,190
What is the total change in
entropy of the universe for

164
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,380
the reversible process?

165
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,640
So for the universe, that's
going to be-- Our universe

166
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,960
here is the reservoir
in our system.

167
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,040
So let me write here.

168
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,240
Reversible.

169
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,260
I don't want to run
out of space.

170
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,670
Let me see, I'll do it
in a different color.

171
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,700
So this is the reversible
process.

172
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,510
So the change in entropy of the
universe is equal to the

173
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:29,050
change in entropy of our
reversible process plus the

174
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,390
change in entropy of-- oh, I
already used R for reversible,

175
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,670
so let's call it the reserv--
well, the first three letters

176
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,350
are the same, so let me call
it of our environment.

177
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,900
Right?

178
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,195
And then the reversible process,
the change in entropy

179
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:49,436
of our reversible process is
the heat added for our

180
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:50,370
reversible process.

181
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,730
And we can use this definition
because it is

182
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,890
a reversible process.

183
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,690
It's that over T1.

184
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,500
And then what's the change in
entropy of our environment?

185
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,830
Well it's giving away Q sub R.

186
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,230
Right?

187
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,850
So its heat absorbed
is minus Q sub R.

188
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,700
And, of course, it's at a
constant temperature.

189
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,180
It is a heat reservoir.

190
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,540
It's at T1.

191
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,090
So it equals 0.

192
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,510
It equals 0.

193
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,440
Interesting.

194
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,990
So actually I should take
a little side note here.

195
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,500
That, the change in entropy of
the universe for a reversible

196
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,440
process is 0.

197
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,590
And actually that should make
a lot of intuitive sense

198
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,040
because the whole point of a
reversal process is you could

199
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,370
go in this direction, or you
could go in that direction.

200
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,360
It's always so close people to
equilibrium you can move in

201
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
either direction.

202
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,890
And if the entropy was greater
than 0 in one direction, it

203
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,289
would have to be less than
0 on the other direction.

204
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,540
So it wouldn't be able to go in
the other direction by the

205
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,550
second law of thermodynamics.

206
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,110
So it actually makes sense
that the entropy of the

207
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,390
universe-- the change in entropy
of the universe, not

208
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,270
just of the system--
when a reversible

209
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,000
process occurs, is 0.

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,860
Let's see if we can relate
that to the irreversible

211
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,490
process So if I wanted to
figure out the change in

212
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,750
entropy of the irreversible
process-- What's the change in

213
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,870
entropy of the irreversible
process?

214
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:15,130
And then let me subtract from
that the heat that was taken

215
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,200
away from the reservoir, from
the irreversible process, Q

216
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,300
sub IR, and of course
all this over T1.

217
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,870
What is this going to be equal
to in relation to 0?

218
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,350
Remember this is an

219
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,980
irreversible, spontaneous process.

220
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,770
Well, this value, the
irreversible process is

221
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,220
starting here and going there.

222
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,010
So its change in delta S is the
exact same thing as that.

223
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,460
Change in delta S is the same
as the reversible process.

224
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,130
So these two things
are equivalent.

225
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,810
Now, I just told you that since
there's some heat of

226
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,810
friction, this guy has to take
in less heat from the

227
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,550
reservoir than this guy.

228
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,380
So if this-- and I
wrote it here.

229
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,940
I mean, let me clean this
thing up a little bit.

230
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,670
I wrote it right here.

231
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,530
Q sub IR, the heat that the
irreversible process has to

232
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,570
take from the reservoir, because
generating its own

233
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,160
heat from friction, is less
than the heat from the

234
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,610
reversal process.

235
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,150
So this number, right here, is
less than this number here.

236
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,360
Or you could view it this way.

237
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,560
This number here was
equal to this.

238
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
So this number here is going
to be less than this.

239
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:31,870
So this has to be greater than
0 for the irreversible,

240
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:38,150
spontaneous process.

241
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,130
Now let's just do a little
bit of mathematics.

242
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,340
So this is the heat that was
essentially given to the

243
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,910
irreversible system.

244
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,600
It's a minus here because
this is the term.

245
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,220
It's kind of taken away from
the actual reservoir.

246
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,650
So let's just do a little bit
of-- let's just multiply all

247
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,825
sides of this equation by T1.

248
00:10:56,825 --> 00:11:04,980
And we get T1 times delta S of
the irreversible process minus

249
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,000
Q of the irreversible process
is greater than 0.

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,550
Now, well, let's just--
So what is this?

251
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,220
How can we say this?

252
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,680
But let's actually just multiply
both sides of this by

253
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,420
negative 1.

254
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,590
And remember, this
is true for any

255
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,090
irreversible, spontaneous process.

256
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,450
If you multiply both
sides of this by

257
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,680
negative 1, you get this.

258
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,970
The heat added to the
irreversible process minus T

259
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,990
times delta S of the
irreversible process is going

260
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,200
to be less than 0.

261
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,840
This is true for any

262
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,230
irreversible, spontaneous process.

263
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,080
And at this point,
this should look

264
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,320
reasonably familiar to you.

265
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,240
When we wrote the Gibbs Free
Energy formula, we said change

266
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,950
in G is equal to delta H
minus T times delta S.

267
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,310
And we said that if this is less
than 0, then we have a

268
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,560
spontaneous process.

269
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,500
   

270
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,510
And this all makes sense.

271
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,590
Because these two are equivalent
to each other.

272
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,750
What's the only difference
here?

273
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,710
Here we wrote heat added
to the system.

274
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,260
Here we wrote change
in enthalpy.

275
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,400
And I've done three or four
videos right now, where I say

276
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,860
that change in enthalpy is equal
to the heat added to a

277
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,560
system, as long as we're
dealing with a constant

278
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,270
pressure system.

279
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,750
So we get this result just by
comparing a irreversible to a

280
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,560
reversible system.

281
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,750
And this is true for all

282
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,790
irreversible, spontaneous processes.

283
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,100
And then if we assume that we're
dealing with a constant

284
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,130
pressure system-- so you can
forget a little bit of what I

285
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,072
just drew, because we know
that this is true, and we

286
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:44,420
assume constant pressure--
then we get to this.

287
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,720
And then we know that if
something is spontaneous, then

288
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,590
this right here must
be less than 0.

289
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,590
So hopefully you found that
a little bit interesting.

290
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,320
Actually I'll do one
more point here.

291
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,390
This kind of gels with the
idea that second law of

292
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,810
thermodynamics tells us that for
any spontaneous process,

293
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,400
delta S is going to be greater
than or equal-- or well for

294
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,330
any spontaneous process, is
going to be greater than 0.

295
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,090
Because although this right
here isn't the formal

296
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,390
definition of entropy, because
we're not dealing with a

297
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,510
reversible process here,
you can kind of

298
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,500
think of it that way.

299
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,100
And so, at least, on an
intuitive level it gets you

300
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,350
there, that we have delta
S greater than 0.

301
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,270
And I won't fixate on that too
much, because what I did

302
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,890
earlier in the video is more
rigorous than what I'm heading

303
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,560
to right now.

304
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,820
So hopefully that gives you a
sense of where you can get to

305
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,140
the Gibbs Free Energy formula,
and how it drives spontaneous

306
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,900
reactions from just our basic
understanding of what

307
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,790
reversible and irreversible
processes are, and how they

308
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,830
relate to entropy and heat
exchange and enthalpy.

309
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,080
