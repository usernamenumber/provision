1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,200
We'll now move from the world
of first order differential

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,400
equations to the world
of second order

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,280
differential equations.

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,800
And what does that mean?

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,450
That means that we're now going
to start involving the

7
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,600
second derivative.

8
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,510
And the first class that I'm
going to show you-- and this

9
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,360
is probably the most useful
class when you're studying

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,990
classical physics-- are
linear second order

11
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,080
differential equations.

12
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,150
So what is a linear second order
differential equation?

13
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,210
I think I touched on it a little
bit in our very first

14
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,760
intro video.

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,820
But it's something that
looks like this.

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,270
If I have a of x-- so some
function only of x-- times the

17
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:42,110
second derivative of y, with
respect to x, plus b of x,

18
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,420
times the first derivative of
y, with respect to x, plus c

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:56,200
of x, times y is equal to some
function that's only a

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,140
function of x.

21
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,760
So just to review our
terminology, y is the second

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,910
order because the highest
derivative here is the second

23
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,170
derivative, so that makes
it second order.

24
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,220
And what makes it linear?

25
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,770
Well all of the coefficients
on-- and I want to be careful

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,950
with the term coefficients,
because traditionally we view

27
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,760
coefficients as always being
constants-- but here we have

28
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,880
functions of x as
coefficients.

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,550
So in order for this to be a
linear differential equation,

30
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,120
a of x, b of x, c of x and d
of x, they all have to be

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,770
functions only of x, as
I've drawn it here.

32
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,580
And now, before we start
trying to solve this

33
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,730
generally, we'll do a special
case of this, where a, b, c

34
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,190
are constants and d is 0.

35
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,890
So what will that look like?

36
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,100
So I can just rewrite that as
A-- so now A is not a function

37
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,790
anymore, it's just a number-- A
times the second derivative

38
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:02,070
of y, with respect to x, plus B
times the first derivative,

39
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,230
plus C times y.

40
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,600
And instead of having just a
fourth constant, instead of d

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,670
of x, I'm just going to
set that equal to 0.

42
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,090
And by setting this equal to 0,
I have now introduced you

43
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,010
to the other form
of homogeneous

44
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,180
differential equation.

45
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,890
And this one is called
homogeneous.

46
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,490
And I haven't made the
connection yet on how these

47
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,830
second order differential
equations are related to the

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,200
first order ones that I just
introduced-- to these other

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,130
homogeneous differential
equations I introduced you to.

50
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,720
I think they just happen to
have the same name, even

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,700
though they're not
that related.

52
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,350
So the reason why this one is
called homogeneous is because

53
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,920
you have it equal to 0.

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,750
So this is what makes
it homogeneous.

55
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,250
And actually, I do see more of a
connection between this type

56
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,000
of equation and milk where all
the fat is spread out, because

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,320
if you think about it, the
solution for all homogeneous

58
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,295
equations, when you kind of
solve the equation, they

59
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:04,240
always equal 0.

60
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,010
So they're homogenized, I guess
is the best way that I

61
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,950
can draw any kind of parallel.

62
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,390
So we could call this a second
order linear because A, B, and

63
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,290
C definitely are functions just
of-- well, they're not

64
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,310
even functions of x or y,
they're just constants.

65
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,445
So second order linear
homogeneous-- because they

66
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:28,800
equal 0-- differential
equations.

67
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,420
And I think you'll see that
these, in some ways, are the

68
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,240
most fun differential
equations to solve.

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,470
And actually, often the most
useful because in a lot of the

70
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,760
applications of classical
mechanics, this is all you

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,420
need to solve.

72
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,820
But they're the most fun to
solve because they all boil

73
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,660
down to Algebra II problems.
And I'll touch

74
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,960
on that in a second.

75
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,660
But let's just think about
this a little bit.

76
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,180
Think about what the
properties of these

77
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,130
solutions might be.

78
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,870
Let me just throw
out something.

79
00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:01,500
Let's say that g of
x is a solution.

80
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,590
   

81
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:12,650
So that means that A times g
prime prime, plus B times g

82
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,839
prime, plus C times
g is equal to 0.

83
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,550
Right?

84
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,200
These mean the same thing.

85
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,490
Now, my question to you is,
what if I have some

86
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,040
constant times g?

87
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,170
Is that still a solution?

88
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:32,620
So my question is, let's say
some constant c1 gx-- c1 times

89
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,860
g-- is this a solution?

90
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,560
Well, let's try it out.

91
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,610
Let's substitute this into
our original equation.

92
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,770
So A times the second derivative
of this would just

93
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:49,000
be-- and I'll switch colors
here; let me switch to brown--

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,970
so A times the second derivative
of this would be--

95
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,770
the constant, every time you
take a derivative, the

96
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,900
constant just carries over-- so
that'll just be A times c1

97
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,640
g prime prime, plus-- the
same thing for the first

98
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:14,190
derivative-- B times c1 g prime,
plus C-- and this C is

99
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,430
different than the
c1 c-- times g.

100
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,360
And let's see whether
this is equal to 0.

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,190
So we could factor out that c1
constant, and we get c1 times

102
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:37,130
Ag prime prime, plus
Bg prime, plus Cg.

103
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,460
And lo and behold,
we already know.

104
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,950
Because we know that g of
x is a solution, we know

105
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,130
that this is true.

106
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,080
So this is going to
be equal to 0.

107
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,440
Because g is a solution.

108
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,060
So if this is 0, c1 times 0
is going to be equal to 0.

109
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,610
So this expression up here
is also equal to 0.

110
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,870
Or another way to view it is
that if g is a solution to

111
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,720
this second order linear
homogeneous differential

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,790
equation, then some constant
times g is also a solution.

113
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,770
So this is also a solution to
the differential equation.

114
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,840
And then the next property I
want to show you-- and this is

115
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,110
all going someplace,
don't worry.

116
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,410
The next question I want to ask
you is, OK, we know that g

117
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,010
of x is a solution to the
differential equation.

118
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,510
What if I were to also
tell you that h

119
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,090
of x is also a solution?

120
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,900
   

121
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:42,700
So my question to you is, is g
of x plus h of x a solution?

122
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,200
   

123
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,330
If you add these two functions
that are both solutions, if

124
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,400
you add them together, is that
still a solution of our

125
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,970
original differential
equation?

126
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,150
Well, let's substitute this
whole thing into our original

127
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,090
differential equation, right?

128
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,620
So we'll have A times
the second

129
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,430
derivative of this thing.

130
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,590
Well, that's straightforward
enough.

131
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:11,580
That's just g prime prime, plus
h prime prime, plus B

132
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,500
times-- the first derivative of
this thing-- g prime plus h

133
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:25,370
prime, plus C times-- this
function-- g plus h.

134
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,200
And now what can we do?

135
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,880
Let's distribute all
of these constants.

136
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,440
We get A times g prime prime,
plus A times h prime prime,

137
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,320
plus B times the first
derivative of g, plus B times

138
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,270
the first derivative of
h, plus C times g,

139
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,510
plus C times h.

140
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,350
And now we can rearrange them.

141
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,580
And we get A-- let's take this
one; let's take all the g

142
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,140
terms-- A times the second
derivative of g, plus B times

143
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,930
the first derivative, plus C
times g-- that's these three

144
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:07,090
terms-- plus A times the second
derivative of h, plus B

145
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,040
times the first derivative,
plus C times h.

146
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,890
And now we know that both g
and h are solutions of the

147
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,130
original differential
equation.

148
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,390
So by definition, if g is a
solution of the original

149
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,350
differential equation, and this
was the left-hand side of

150
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,850
that differential equation, this
is going to be equal to

151
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:32,520
0, and so is this going
to be equal to 0.

152
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,429
So we've shown that this whole
expression is equal to 0.

153
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,789
So if g is a solution of the
differential equation-- of

154
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,480
this second order linear
homogeneous differential

155
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,110
equation-- and h is also a
solution, then if you were to

156
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,720
add them together, the sum of
them is also a solution.

157
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,070
So in general, if we show that
g is a solution and h is a

158
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,820
solution, you can add them.

159
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,490
And we showed before that
any constant times

160
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,020
them is also a solution.

161
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,590
So you could also say that some
constant times g of x

162
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:10,270
plus some constant times h
of x is also a solution.

163
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,150
And maybe the constant
in one of the

164
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,560
cases is 0 or something.

165
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,290
I don't know.

166
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,350
But anyway, these are useful
properties to maybe

167
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,290
internalize for second order
homogeneous linear

168
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,560
differential equations.

169
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,600
And in the next video, we're
actually going to apply these

170
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,660
properties to figure out the
solutions for these.

171
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,190
And you'll see that they're
actually straightforward.

172
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,690
I would say a lot easier than
what we did in the previous

173
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,070
first order homogeneous
difference equations, or the

174
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,020
exact equations.

175
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,310
This is much, much easier.

176
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,550
I'll see you in the
next video.

177
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,900
