1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:08,005
For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that the current conversion rate is 6 Chinese Yuan per 1 US dollar.

2
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:14,023
And at that exchange rate, China is exporting 50 million dollars worth of goods to the United States.

3
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:18,080
And the U.S. is exporting 20 million dollars worth of goods to China.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,033
So clearly, there is a trade imbalance; the U.S. is importing 50 millions dollars worth of goods.

5
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:27,089
And it's exporting 20 million dollars worth of goods.

6
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:31,037
So it has a 30 million dollar trade deficit.

7
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:36,042
Now in this situation, the Chinese manufacturer is going to have 50 million dollars that it's going to

8
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:40,070
want to convert from its revenue in America and convert that to Chinese currency.

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:47,070
The American manufacturer is going to want to convert its Yuan into 20 million dollars.

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,079
So the supply of dollars which is this 50 million right over here is going to be much greater

11
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,051
than the demand which is the 20 million dollars.

12
00:00:57,051 --> 00:01:02,008
So if the currencies were allowed to float, the dollar would weaken.

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,092
The cost of the dollar would go down, it's supply is so much bigger than the demand.

14
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:11,020
But let's say that the Chinese central bank does not want that to happen.

15
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:18,085
So this is the People's Bank of China.

16
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:26,019
They do not want the Chinese currency to strengthen because if that were to happen then Chinese goods

17
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:30,018
would become more expensive in the United States and it would be harder to maintain this trade imbalance - they want it.

18
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:36,059
So what they do is essentially make up for the difference in the demand for the dollar.

19
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:41,093
Right here, there is only demand for 20 million dollars, there supply of 50.

20
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:45,079
So what they do is create demand for 30 million dollars.

21
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:50,020
And the way that they create demand for 30 million dollars at that exchange rate is that

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:02:00,083
they can literally print (create) 180 million Yuan,

23
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:07,019
and then at an exchange rate of 6 to 1 they can go out into the open markets.

24
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:09,034
And try to convert this into dollars.

25
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:15,029
And so this would create demand for an incremental 30 million dollars.

26
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:21,017
And so when they do that the total demand for dollars is their 30 million plus the 20 million dollars

27
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:27,007
from the American manufacturer that will completely equal the supply of dollars at that exchange rate

28
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:32,069
and so it will not cause the exchange rate to fluctuate or the balance of trade to change.

29
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,061
So this is clearly a very simplified example;

30
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:44,011
the actual numbers are much larger than in the millions: they are in the hundreds of billions of dollars,

31
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:51,086
but this gives, at least in my mind, a respectable idea of how the Chinese central bank is actually keeping

32
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:56,070
its currency pegged to the dollars and how that's helping to maintain a trade imbalance.

33
00:02:56,070 --> 99:59:59,999
