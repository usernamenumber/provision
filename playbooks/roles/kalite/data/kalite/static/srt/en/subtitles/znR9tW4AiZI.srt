1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
   

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,150
We're now going to do a few
examples to actually show

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,320
you why the trig functions
are actually useful.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,760
So let's get started
with a problem.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,065
Let's say I have this
right triangle.

6
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:15,860
   

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,040
That's my right triangle.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,990
   

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,470
There's the right angle.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,950
And let's say I know that
the measure of this angle

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,710
is pi over 4 radians.

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,980
And I'll just write
rad for short.

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,230
If the measure of this angle is
pi over 4 radians, and I also

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,900
know that this side of the
triangle-- this side right

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:48,080
here-- is 10 square roots of 2.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,970
So I know this side
of the triangle.

17
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,690
I know this angle, which
is pi over 4 radians.

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,420
And now, the question is, what
is this side of the triangle?

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,410
I'm going to highlight that.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,680
And let me make it in orange.

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,190
   

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,900
So let's figure out what
we know and what we

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,390
need to figure out.

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,500
We know the angle,
pi over 4 radians.

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,970
And actually, turns out if
you were to convert that

26
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,290
to degrees, it would
be 45 degrees.

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,120
And we know-- what
side is this?

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,440
This is the hypotenuse
of the triangle, right?

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,130
And what are we trying
to figure out?

30
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,720
Are we trying to figure out
the hypotenuse, the adjacent

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,390
side to the angle, or the
opposite side to the angle?

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,540
Well, this is the hypotenuse,
we already know that.

33
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,430
This is the opposite side.

34
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:39,510
   

35
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,090
This is the opposite side.

36
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,080
And this yellow side is
the adjacent side, right?

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,260
It's just adjacent
to this angle.

38
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,150
So we know the angle, we know
the hypotenuse, and we want to

39
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,060
figure out the adjacent side.

40
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,240
So let me ask you a question.

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,910
What trig function deals
with the adjacent side

42
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,360
and the hypotenuse?

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,620
Because we have the adjacent
side is what we want

44
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,005
to figure out, and we
know the hypotenuse.

45
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:05,770
Well, let's write down
our mnemonic, just in

46
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,390
case you forgot it.

47
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:08,836
SOHCAHTOA.

48
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:16,820
   

49
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,650
So which one uses
adjacent and hypotenuse?

50
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:19,990
Right?

51
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,750
It's CAH.

52
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,770
And CAH, the c is for what?

53
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,150
The c is for cosine.

54
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,980
Cosine of an angle-- let's just
call it any angle-- is equal to

55
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,870
the adjacent over
the hypotenuse.

56
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,460
So let's use this information
to try to solve for this orange

57
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,790
side, or this yellow side.

58
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,350
So we know that cosine of pi
over 4 radians-- so let's say

59
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:55,580
cosine of pi over 4-- must
equal this adjacent

60
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,820
side right here.

61
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,190
Let's just call that
a. a for adjacent.

62
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,030
The adjacent side divided
by the hypotenuse.

63
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,540
The hypotenuse is this side.

64
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,590
And in the problem, we
were given that it's

65
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,730
10 square roots of 2.

66
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:15,250
   

67
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,790
So we can solve for a by
multiplying both sides of

68
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,130
this equation by 10
square roots of 2.

69
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,180
And we will get--
because, right?

70
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,650
If we just multiply times
10 square root of 2,

71
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,580
these cancel out.

72
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,650
And then you get a 10
square root of 2 here.

73
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:37,840
So you get a is equal to 10
square roots of 2 times

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,710
the cosine of pi over 4.

75
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,860
Now you're probably saying,
Sal, this does not look too

76
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,170
simple, and I don't know how
big the cosine of pi over 4 is.

77
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,450
What do I do?

78
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,650
Well, no one has the trig
functions, or the values of

79
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,450
the trig functions memorized.

80
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,730
There's a couple
of ways to do it.

81
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,710
Either I could give you what
the cosine of pi over 4 is.

82
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,270
That's sometimes
given in a problem.

83
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,400
Or you can make sure that your
calculator is set to radians

84
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,400
and you can just type in pi
divided by 4-- which is roughly

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,530
0.79-- and then press
the cosine button.

86
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,960
You finally know
what it's good for.

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,250
And you'll get a value.

88
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,370
Or-- and this is kind of the
old school way of doing it--

89
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,554
there are trig tables where
you could look up what cosine

90
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:22,540
of pi over 4 is in a table.

91
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,430
Since I don't have any of that
at my disposal right now,

92
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,040
I'll just tell you what the
cosine of pi over 4 is.

93
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,760
The cosine of pi over 4 is
square root of 2 over 2.

94
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,970
So a, which is the adjacent
side-- a for adjacent-- is

95
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:46,470
equal to 10 square roots of 2
times square root of 2 over 2.

96
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,750
Remember, to get the square
root of 2 over 2, you might

97
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,330
be a little confused.

98
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,210
You're like, how
did Sal get that?

99
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,420
All I said is, the cosine
of pi over 4 is square

100
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,090
root of 2 over 2.

101
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,010
And that's not something that--
well, actually, this one you

102
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,420
might know offhand, because
of the 45 degree angle.

103
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,490
But this isn't something
that people memorize.

104
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,275
This is something you would
look up, or it's given in

105
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:05,660
the problem, or you'd
use a calculator for.

106
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,610
And a calculator, of course,
wouldn't give you square

107
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,020
root of 2 over 2.

108
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,910
It'd give you a decimal
number that's not obviously

109
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,180
square root of 2 over 2.

110
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,800
But anyway, I told you that the
cosine of pi over 4 is the

111
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,310
square root of 2 over 2.

112
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,050
And so if we multiply, what's
the square root of 2 over 2?

113
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,560
What's the square root of 2
times the square root of 2?

114
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,140
It's 2.

115
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,690
So that's 2, and then that
cancels with that 2.

116
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,570
And so everything cancels
except for the 10.

117
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,340
So the adjacent side
is equal to 10.

118
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,230
   

119
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,140
Let's do another one.

120
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:43,200
   

121
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,230
Let me delete this.

122
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,260
   

123
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,180
Give me 1 second.

124
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,550
I'm actually-- this is one of
the few modules that I'm not

125
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,770
generating the problems on the
fly, because I need to make

126
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,200
sure that I actually have
the trig function values

127
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,920
before I do the problem.

128
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,820
So let's say I have
another right triangle.

129
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,470
I probably shouldn't have
deleted that last one.

130
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,320
So let's see, this is
my right triangle.

131
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,350
How much time do I have--
about 4 minutes left.

132
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,700
Should be enough.

133
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,880
So this is my right triangle.

134
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,470
And I know the angle--
let's call this--.

135
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,970
I know this angle right
here is 0.54 radians.

136
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:38,240
And I also know that this side
right here is 3 units long.

137
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,680
And I want to figure
out this side.

138
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,390
So what do I know?

139
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,300
Well, this side is what side
relative to the angle?

140
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,930
It's the opposite side, right?

141
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,760
Because the angle is here, and
we go opposite the angle.

142
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,110
So this is the opposite side.

143
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,080
And what's this side?

144
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,220
Is this the adjacent side,
or is it the hypotenuse?

145
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,370
Well, this is the
hypotenuse, right?

146
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,600
The long side, and it's
opposite the right angle.

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,070
So this is the adjacent side.

148
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,510
So what trig function uses
opposite and adjacent?

149
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,400
Let's write down
SOHCAHTOA again.

150
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,760
SOHCAHTOA.

151
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,220
   

152
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,160
TOA uses opposite and adjacent.

153
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,420
OA.

154
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,620
   

155
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,540
So T for tangent, right?

156
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,840
TOA.

157
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,280
So tangent is equal to
opposite over adjacent.

158
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,520
So let's use that.

159
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,040
So let's take the tangent
of 0.54 radians.

160
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:44,320
So the tangent of 0.54 will
equal the side opposite to it.

161
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,600
So that's 3, right?

162
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,070
The opposite side is 3.

163
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,750
Over the adjacent side.

164
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,550
Well, once again, the adjacent
side is what we don't know.

165
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,520
So we have to solve for a.

166
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,020
So if we multiply both sides
by a, we get a tan of 0.54--

167
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,860
we could do that because we
know it's not 0-- equals 3.

168
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:18,240
Or a is equal to 3 divided
by the tangent of 0.54.

169
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,500
So once again, I don't have
memorized what the tangent of

170
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:29,770
0.54 is, but I will tell you
what it is because you also

171
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,480
don't have it memorized.

172
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,990
Or you could use a calculator
to figure it out if you

173
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,060
had a radian function.

174
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,730
The tangent of 0.54 is equal
to-- let me make sure

175
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,080
I have this right.

176
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,960
Oh, right.

177
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,270
The tangent of 0.54 is 3/5.

178
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:51,830
So then a is equal
to 3 over 3/5.

179
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,500
   

180
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,850
Right, the adjacent side--
now, once again, how

181
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,810
did I get this 3/5?

182
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,820
Well, I just told you.

183
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,200
Or you can use a calculator
to know that the

184
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,250
tangent of 0.54 is 3/5.

185
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,130
And of course, I'm using
numbers that work out

186
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,400
well, just so that the
fractions all cancel.

187
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,580
So we know that the adjacent
side is equal to-- when you

188
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,550
divide by fractions, it's like
multiplying by the numerator.

189
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,420
Multiplying by the inverse.

190
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,430
So times 5/3.

191
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,370
So the adjacent side
is equal to 5.

192
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,120
There.

193
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,930
There you go.

194
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,870
So let's just think
about what I always do.

195
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,190
I think about what I have,
what sides I have, and what

196
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,210
side I want to solve for.

197
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,130
And in this case, it was the
opposite side I had, and I

198
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,740
wanted to solve for
the adjacent side.

199
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,170
And I said, what trig function
involves those 2 sides?

200
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,940
The opposite and the adjacent.

201
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,880
I wrote down SOHCAHTOA.

202
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,410
I said, oh, TOA.

203
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,370
Opposite and adjacent.

204
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,320
That's tan.

205
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,500
So I took the tan of the angle.

206
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,960
And then I said, the tan of the
angle is equal to the opposite

207
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,820
side divided by the
adjacent side.

208
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,780
That's right here.

209
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,430
And then I just solved
for the adjacent side.

210
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,740
And of course, I used a
calculator, or I told you

211
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,880
what the tangent of 0.54 is.

212
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,110
I think I'll do a couple more
of these problems in the next

213
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,960
module, but I'm out
of time for now.

214
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,480
Have fun.

215
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,500
