1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,133
let r be the region of the first quadrant enclosed by the graphs of f of x is equal to 8 x to the third,

2
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:11,333
and g of x is equal to sine of pi x as shown in the figure above, and they drew the figure right over

3
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:17,133
here. Part A: Write the equation for the line tangent to the graph of f if x is equal to 1/2. So let

4
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:21,293
me just redraw it here, just so that, I like drawing on a black background, I guess that's the main reason im

5
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:29,304
why I'm redrawing it, so the function f of x is 8, is equal to 8 x to the third, looks like this, it looks

6
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:37,000
like that, this is our f of x axis this is our x axis, and we want an equation for the line tangent at

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,067
x is equal to 1/2, so this is x is equal to 1/2, go up here, if you evaluate f of 1/2, you get you f-you

8
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:50,712
get 8 times 1/2 to the third, which is 8 times one-eighths, which is 1, they actually gave us

9
00:00:50,712 --> 00:00:57,667
that already on this point, which is 1/2, comma 1, and we need to find the equation for the tangent line.

10
00:00:57,983 --> 00:00:58,483
The tangent line will look something like that, and to figure out its equation, we just really figure

11
00:00:58,483 --> 00:00:59,061
out its slope, and then we know a point that its on, and we can either use point-slope, or you can just

12
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:14,165
use your kind of standard slope intercept form to give an equation for that line. So the first part,

13
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:18,739
lets figure out its slope, and the slope of the tangent line is going to be the same slope as the slope

14
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:25,867
of our function at that point, or another way to think about it, it is going to be f prime, f prime of

15
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:33,067
1/2, or the derivative evaluate at 1/2. The derivate gives us the slope of that line at any point, so

16
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:41,425
what is f prime of x? F prime of x is just the derivative of this, so 3 times 8 is 24, times x squared,

17
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:53,533
24 x squared, f prime of 1/2 is equal to 24 times 1/2 squared, which is equal 24 times 1/4, which is

18
00:01:53,533 --> 00:02:01,162
equal to 6. So the slope of this line is equal to 6, I'll use m for slope which will be, we mentioned

19
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:07,152
that we would be using algebra, we first learned it in algebra, so the slope is going to be 6, so the

20
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:14,933
general equation of this line is y is equal to mx plus b, this is the slope, this is the y-intercept,

21
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:20,400
we already know that the slope is 6, and then we can use the fact that the line goes through the point

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:30,133
1/2, 1 to figure out what b is, so when y is 1, 1 is equal to our slope times x, x is 1/2, or another way

23
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:37,067
to say it, when x is 1/2, y is 1 plus some, plus some y-intercept, or if I take x is 1/2, I multiply

24
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:44,235
it by the slope, plus the y-intercept, I should get 1. So I get 1 is equal to 3 plus b, I can subtract

25
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:51,533
3 from both sides, and I get negative 2 is equal to b. So the equation of the line is going to be y is

26
00:02:51,533 --> 00:03:03,229
equal to 6 x minus 2. That is the equation of the tangent line. Now part B: Find the area of r. So r

27
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:09,893
is this region right over here, is this region right over here, it's bounded on-above by g of x, which

28
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:19,158
is the sine of pi x, it's bounded below, it's bounded below by f of x, or 8 x to the third. So the area,

29
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:25,933
the area is going to be, so I'll just scroll down a litle bit, I still want to be able to see this graph

30
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:38,467
over here. Part b, part b. The area of r is going to be equal to the integral, from 0, from 0, that's

31
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:47,800
this point of intersection right over here, to 1/2, so I'll make it here, this is 0 to 1/2, 0 to 1/2,

32
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,662
and then the function on the top, so we could just take the area of that, but we'll have to subtract

33
00:03:53,662 --> 00:04:00,141
from that the area underneath the function below, or one way to think about it, the integral from 0 to

34
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:09,800
1/2 of the top function is g of x, which is sine of pi x, so the sine of pi x, the sine of pi x, but

35
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,906
if we just evaluated this integral, let me just put a d x over here, if we just evaluted this we would

36
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:23,570
get the entire area of this entire region, but what we need to do is subtract out the area underneath

37
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:30,814
the second, underneath f of x, let me just subtract the area under that, so we just subtract from that

38
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:39,733
f of x, and f of x we already saw is 8 x to the third, is 8 x to the third power. And now we can just

39
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:45,533
evaluate this, so let me draw a little line here, it's getting a little messy, it's getting a little bit messy,

40
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:51,867
I'll just do it down here, so we need to take the anti-derivative of sine of pi x. Well, the derivative

41
00:04:51,867 --> 00:05:00,652
of, the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine x, the derivative of cosine of pi x is negative pi

42
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:08,600
cosine of pi x, so the derivate- the anti-derivative of sine of pi x is going to be negative 1 over pi

43
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:16,200
cosine, cosine of pi x. And you can verify it for yourself, and you might say, "How do you know it was

44
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,400
a negative?" Well, I put the negative there, so that when I take the derivative of the cosine of pi x,

45
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,867
I would get a negative sign, but that negative will cancel out the negative to get a postive here, and

46
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,770
you say, "Why did you put a one over pi here?" Well, when you take the derivative of this this, using

47
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,273
the chain rule, you take the derivative of the pi x, you'll get pi, and you would multiply everything

48
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:41,101
by, and then you would get negative sine of pi x, and that pi doesn't show up here, so I need something

49
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:46,467
for it to cancel out with, and that's what this one over-one over pi is going to cancel out with. And

50
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:51,200
you can do u substitution, and all the rest, if, if, if you found that, if you found something like that

51
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:58,867
useful, but it's in general a good habit, or I guess it's a good-it's good to be able to do this almost,

52
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:01,667
almost by sight, so...

53
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,467
and you can verify that this derivative is equal to sine of pi x

54
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,806
so the anti-derivative of sine of pi x is this,

55
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:12,933
the anti-derivative of negative 8x to the 3rd power is negative 8

56
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:17,333
I'm going to divide it by 4, so negative 2x to the 4th power

57
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:21,333
and I just, all I did is I incremented the 3 to a 4

58
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,867
and then I divided the 8 by the 4

59
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,333
and you can take the derivative of this

60
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:29,267
to verify that it is the same thing as negative 8x to the 3rd power

61
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:33,400
Now we're going to have to evaluate that from 0 to 1/2.

62
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,501
When you evaluate at 1/2...so I'm going to get...I'm going to get

63
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:43,006
negative 1 over pi, cosine of pi over 2

64
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:50,831
cosine of pi over 2 minus 2 times 1/2 to the 4th power is 1/16

65
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:53,600
so that's it evaluated at 1/2

66
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,267
and then from that I'm going to subtract negative 1 over pi cosine of 0

67
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:00,800
let me just write it out...

68
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:09,533
so minus negative 1 over pi, negative 1 over pi cosine of pi times 0

69
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:15,333
cosine of pi, let me just write, cosine of 0 pi I could write or pi times 0

70
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,133
minus 2 times 0 to the 4th

71
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,670
so that's just going to be minus 0

72
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,933
so let's evaluate this...

73
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:26,267
so to simplify it, we have a cosine of pi over 2

74
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:31,200
cosine of pi over 2, is just going to be 0. So this whole thing just becomes 0

75
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,832
and then you have a negative 2 divided by 16, that's negative 1/8

76
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:36,467
negative 1/8...

77
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:40,133
and then from that I'm going to subtract this business here

78
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:47,673
cosine of 0, this is 1. So this is just a negative 1 over pi, a negative 1 over pi

79
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:49,507
and then I have a 0 there, so I can ignore that

80
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:55,600
so this is equal to negative 1 over 8, plus, plus 1 over pi

81
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,200
and we are done.

82
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,067
This part of it, you're not allowed to use a calculator

83
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,333
so this is about as far as I would expect them to get

84
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:06,600
to, to, for, eh... about as far as I would expect them, to expect you, uh, to get

85
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
and so I'll leave you there

86
00:08:08,000 --> 99:59:59,999
in the next video we will do part... we will do part C
