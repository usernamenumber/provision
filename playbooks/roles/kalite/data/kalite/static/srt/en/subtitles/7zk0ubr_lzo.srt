00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,170
Sal: This is Sal here, and I have Dr. David Agus visiting the office,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,848
and I want you to introduce yourself, because you have kind of an interesting life.

3
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:13,082
Dr.: "Interesting Life," is scary, but I'm a Professor of Medicine and Engineering

4
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:15,559
at the University of Southern California.

5
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,316
I treat cancer patients and I have a lab that looks at new ways

6
00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:21,847
and technologies to understand, and treat cancer.

7
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:25,697
Sal: And that's what's really interesting- the fact that you're a professor of both medicine and engineering.

8
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:27,597
And I guess that's kinda what we're gonna touch on a little bit here.

9
00:00:27,597 --> 00:00:28,415
Dr.: Yeah.

10
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:32,111
Sal: And so, this is clearly a picture of eggs. Why are we looking at eggs?

11
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:37,221
Dr.: Well, if I gave you those eggs, and I put them in your office, and I say "Come back in three weeks",

12
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:38,337
what would you have?

13
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:43,433
Sal: If I . . . they would go bad. I'm not putting one in a fridge, I'm assuming.

14
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,886
Dr.: You have a rotten egg, exactly.

15
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:52,062
But, If I was clever and I changed the temperature of your office to 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit

16
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:56,190
and I rotated those eggs three times, it has to be an odd number,

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,572
and at the end of three weeks, I'd have a chicken.

18
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:01,986
Sal: And a chick, you'd have this,

19
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:07,268
so, you could either have a rotten egg, so this kind of crazy-mess-smelly-thing;

20
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:10,088
or you have this cute, adorable, chicken.

21
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:12,333
Well, though, they call babies "chicks".

22
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,828
Chicks. A babe-oo, uh, a chick. <i>laugh</i>

23
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:21,247
Dr.: Yes, so a small change in temperature and gravity goes from chaos to order.

24
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,298
Sal: Right, right.

25
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:27,336
And so, we're going to talk in a minute about cancer and all the chaos that's involved with it,

26
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:31,596
but realize that, that egg, I changed the temperature and the gravity,

27
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:33,308
and I went from chaos to order.

28
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:37,620
so, while it will seem incomprehensible and unable to model cancer,

29
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,449
you're going to start to see little changes can have major effects.

30
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:45,228
Sal: I see. And this is what's a little bit un-intuitive. So when we think about things like cancer,

31
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:51,220
I mean cancer's not the only one, we imagine that we just kinda kill it.

32
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,614
We just gotta take it out, but what you're saying is that, "Hey, maybe there's these subtle things,

33
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:59,687
that's analogous to rotating an egg, 3 times, and to get the temperature just right,

34
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:02,459
that can make it automatically do different things

35
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:04,998
Exactly. To me, cancer is a verb, not a noun.

36
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,039
So, you're cancering...

37
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,005
..when you have cancer. It's not that you have cancer, you're cancering.

38
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:18,052
So, my goal is to change your state of your body from a cancering to a healthing.

39
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:22,323
and so the fisrt question is - how do you quantitate the state? How do we say

40
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:23,653
who and what you are?

41
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:28,111
And so, technology is giving us the opportunity to do that as we go forward.

42
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:30,989
Right, I just get my head around that because that's just, you know,

43
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,293
word cancering, I think, you've probably invented that word, and so healthing

44
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:40,615
and it's from the idea - once again, when I imagine cancer, and I think it's the way most researchers think about cancer

45
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:43,139
?????????????????

46
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:46,863
and you have to remove them or kill them somehow, stop them from spreading

47
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:51,708
and what you're saying is not that something is going on systemically in your body

48
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,544
that it's cancering it's allowing cancer to thrive.

49
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:59,580
That's it. Your first definiton - you something have to cut out , the different organism

50
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,212
That's bacteria. That's an infection.

51
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:06,042
Something from the oustide comes inside of you

52
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:10,994
I give you the right antibiotic - it doesn't care if you are a man or a woman, you're six feet or three feet.

53
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:14,143
If that antibiotic targets the bacteria, it goes away.

54
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:18,264
The difference in cancer it's your own cells that have gone a little bit crazy

55
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:23,991
a so we have to change the interaction of the body and the cells and order to make the patient better.

56
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:27,991
Very different that something without, this is within.
