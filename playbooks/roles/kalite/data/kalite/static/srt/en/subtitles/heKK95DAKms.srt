1
00:00:00,184 --> 00:00:01,685
So you're me and you're in math class

2
00:00:01,685 --> 00:00:02,898
and you're learning about graph theory,

3
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:04,349
a subject too interesting to be included

4
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:05,662
in most grade school curricula.

5
00:00:05,662 --> 00:00:06,877
So maybe you're in some special program

6
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:07,846
or maybe you're in college

7
00:00:07,846 --> 00:00:09,705
and were somehow not scarred for life

8
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:10,498
by your grade school math teachers.

9
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:11,721
I'm not sure why you're not paying attention

10
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:12,990
but maybe you have an incompetent teacher

11
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,251
and it's too heart-breaking to watch him

12
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,651
butcher what could be a fun subject,

13
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:16,739
full of snakes and balloons.

14
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:19,107
Snakes aren't really all that relevant to the mathematics here.

15
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:20,655
But being able to draw them will be useful later,

16
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:22,378
so you should probably start practicing now.

17
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:24,936
I've got a family of 3 related doodle games to show you,

18
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:27,098
all stemming from drawing squiggles all over the page.

19
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:28,605
The first one goes like this:

20
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:31,022
draw a squiggle- a closed curve that ends where it begins.

21
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,528
The only real rule here is to make sure

22
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:34,047
that all the crossings are distinct.

23
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:35,956
Next, make it start weaving-

24
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:36,968
follow the curve around and

25
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:38,594
that each crossing alternate going under and over

26
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:40,471
until you've assigned all the crossings.

27
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:42,148
Then put on the finishing touches, and voila!

28
00:00:42,148 --> 00:00:44,822
You try it again, adding a little artistic flair to the lines.

29
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:47,155
The cool part is that the weaving always works out perfectly,

30
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:49,226
when you're going around alternating over and under

31
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:50,788
and get to a crossing you've already assigned,

32
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:52,462
it will always be the right one.

33
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:55,037
This is very interesting, and we'll get back to it later.

34
00:00:55,037 --> 00:00:57,749
But first I'd like to point out 2 things: one is that

35
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,654
this works for any number of closed curves on the plane.

36
00:01:00,654 --> 00:01:01,812
So go ahead and link stuff up

37
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,943
or make a weaving out of 2 colors of yarn.

38
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:04,881
The other is that

39
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:07,279
this doodle also works out for snakes on a plane

40
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,274
as long as you keep the head and tail on the outside

41
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:10,435
or on the same inside face.

42
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:12,716
because mathematically it's the same as if they linked up

43
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:15,346
or just actually link up the head and tail into an Ouroboros.

44
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:18,261
For example, here's 3 Ourobori in a configuration

45
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:19,746
known as the Borromean Rings

46
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,479
which has the neat property that

47
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,865
no 2 snakes are actually linked with each other.

48
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,448
Also because I like naming things,

49
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:27,556
this design shall henceforth be known as

50
00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:29,237
the "OuroBorromean Rings".

51
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:30,461
But you are me, after all,

52
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:31,805
so you're finding a lot to think about

53
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:34,082
even with just drawing one line that isn't a snake.

54
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:35,812
Such as, "What kinds of knots are you drawing?"

55
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:37,220
"And can you classify them?"

56
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,388
For example, these 3 knots all have 5 crossings

57
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:42,374
but 2 are essentially the same knot and one is different.

58
00:01:42,374 --> 00:01:45,258
Knot theory questions are actually really difficult and interesting

59
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:47,055
but you're going to have to look that one up yourself.

60
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:48,848
Oh, and you should also learn how to draw rope

61
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:50,829
because it's an integral part of knot theory.

62
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:51,687
So integral, in fact, that

63
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,774
if you draw a bunch of integral signs in a row,

64
00:01:53,774 --> 00:01:56,234
a sight which is often quite daunting to a mathematician,

65
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:58,526
you can just shade it in, and TA-DA.

66
00:01:58,526 --> 00:02:01,490
But, being able to draw snakes is also super useful

67
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,346
especially as this doodle game is excellent for

68
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,157
producing Dark Mark tattoo designs.

69
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:06,860
Also, this doodle game can be combined

70
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,020
with the stars doodle game.

71
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,505
For example, if this pentagram gets knighted,

72
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,331
it will henceforth be known as "Serpentagram"

73
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:16,319
Also notice that this snake is a 5 twist Mobius strip

74
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,946
so you could also call it a "Mobiaboros"

75
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:19,784
but we'll get back to one-sidedness later.

76
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:21,921
Or, if you want to draw something super complicated

77
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:23,438
like the 8th square star,

78
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:26,948
combining snakes and stars is a great technique for that too.

79
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:29,328
Here's a boa that ate 8 8gons.

80
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:31,808
The creativity that your mind is forced into

81
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,736
during these boring classes, is both a gift and a burden.

82
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:37,016
But here's a few authentic doodles using these techniques

83
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:38,457
that I did when I was in college.

84
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:40,079
Just to show you I'm not making all this up.

85
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,895
These are from a freshmen music history class,

86
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,963
because I happen to be able to find this notebook.

87
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,807
But this is a doodle I actually did most often

88
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,336
during my 9th grade Italian class.

89
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:48,518
Language being another subject

90
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:51,163
usually taught by unfathomably stupid methods.

91
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:53,951
For example, these snakes are having trouble communicating

92
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,369
because one speaks in Parseltongue

93
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:56,798
and the other speaks in Python.

94
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:59,022
And their language classes, much like math classes,

95
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:02,193
focus too much on memorization and not enough on immersion

96
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:03,380
But just pretend you're in math class,

97
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,515
learning about graph theory so that I can draw the parallels

98
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:07,227
because here's the 2nd doodle game

99
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:08,987
which is very much mathematically related.

100
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:10,983
Draw a squiggle all over the page

101
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,679
and make sure it closes up.

102
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,393
Pick an outside section and color it in.

103
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:15,728
Now you want to alternate coloring

104
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,426
so that no 2 faces of the same color touch.

105
00:03:18,426 --> 00:03:19,419
Curiously enough,

106
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:20,923
much like the weaving game,

107
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:23,325
this game always mathemagically works out.

108
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:26,126
It also works really well if you make the lines spiky

109
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:27,309
instead of a smooth curve

110
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:29,188
and once again, it works with multiple lines too.

111
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:30,364
It probably has something to do with

112
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:32,332
the 2 colorability of graphs of even degree,

113
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:33,611
which might even be what your teacher is trying to

114
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,708
teach you at this very moment

115
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,009
for all you're paying attention.

116
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:37,524
But maybe you can chat with him after class about snakes

117
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:38,692
and he'll explain it to you

118
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:40,424
because I'd rather move on to the next doodle game.

119
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:42,164
This is a combination of the last 2

120
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:44,523
Step 1: draw a smooth closed curve

121
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:46,374
Step 2: assign overs and unders

122
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:48,423
Step 3: shade in every other face

123
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:51,232
After that, it takes a little artistic finesse

124
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,302
to get the shading right,

125
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:53,372
but you end up with some sort of really neat surface.

126
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:56,772
For example, this one only has one edge and one side

127
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,117
but if you're interested in this,

128
00:03:58,117 --> 00:03:59,372
you should really be talking to

129
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,924
your resident topology professor and not me.

130
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:02,539
But here's the thing:

131
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:03,840
if someone asked you 5 minutes ago

132
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,702
what tangled up snakes, demented checkerboards,

133
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:07,652
and crazy twisty surfaces have in common?

134
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:08,955
what would you have answered?

135
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:11,295
This is why I love mathematics:

136
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:12,726
the moment when you realize that

137
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:14,384
something seemingly arbitrary and confusing

138
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:16,659
is actually part of something.

139
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:18,739
It's better than the cleverest possible ending

140
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:20,194
to any crime show or mystery novel,

141
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,413
because that's only the beginning.

142
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:24,691
Anyway, have fun with that.
