1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We will now begin our journey into the world of Statistics, which is really a way

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to understand, or get our head around, data.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So Statistics is all about data.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And as we begin our journey into the world of Statistics,

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we will be doing a lot of what we can call "Descriptive Statistics."

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we have a bunch of data and want to tell something about all of that data, without giving them all of the data--

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Can we somehow describe it with a smaller set of numbers?

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's what we're going to focus on.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then once we build our tool kit on the Descriptive Statistics,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then we can start to make inferences about that data, start to make conclusions, start to make judgements, and we'll start to do a lot of "Inferential Statistics" -- make inferences.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So with that out of the way, let's think about how we can describe data.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say we have a set of numbers, we can consider this to be "data".

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe we're measuring the heights of our plants in our garden.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say we have 6 plants and the heights are:

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4 inches, 3 inches, 1 inch, 6 inches, and another one is 1 inch and another is 7 inches.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say someone in another room, not looking at your plants, asks:

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"How tall are your plants?" And they only want to hear one number that somehow represents all the different heights of your plants.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How would you do that?

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, you'd say how can I find that? Maybe I want a typical number? Maybe I want the number that somehow represents the middle?

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe I want the most frequent number? Maybe I want a number that represents the center of all of these numbers?

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you said any of those things, you would actually have done the same things

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the people who came up with the descriptive statistics said.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They said, "Well... how can we do it?"

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll start by thinking of the idea of Average. In every-day terminology, "average" has a very particular meaning, as we'll see. When many people talk about average they're talking about the "arithmetic mean", which we'll see shortly.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But in Statistics, average means something more general:

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It really means, give me a "typical" or give me a "middle" number, or... these are "or"s. It's really an attempt to find a measure of "Central Tendency".

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So once again, you have a bunch of numbers, you're somehow trying to represent these with one number (the average) that is somehow typical or middle or center of these numbers.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And as we'll see, there are many of types of averages.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The first is the one, which you are probably most familiar with. It's the one when people talk about the average on this exam or the average height, and that's the arithmetic mean.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll write it in yellow. "Arithmetic mean".

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When Arithmetic is a noun, we call (pronounce) it Uh-rith'-me-tik. When it's an adjective like this, we call (pronounce) it Eh'-rith-me'-tik.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is really just the sum of all the numbers divided by....

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
- And this is a human-constructed definition, that we've found useful -

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of numbers we have.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, what is the arithmetic mean of this data set?

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, Let's just compute it. it's going to be 4 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7 over the number of data points we have. So, we have 6 data points, so we're gonna divide by 6.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we get: 4 +3 = 7 +1 = 8 +6 = 14 +1 = 15 +7 = 22. Let me do that one more time... we have 7, 8, 14, 15, 22. All of that over 6.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we could write this as a mixed number. 6 goes into 22 3 times with a remainder of 4. So it's 3 and 4/6ths which is the same as 3 and 2/3rds. We could write this as a decimal : 3.6 repeating.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We can write it any one of those ways 
but this is kind of a representative number,
this is trying to get at a "central tendency".

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Once again these are human constructed. 
It's not like someone just found some

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
religious document that said, "This is the way 
that the Arithmetic Mean must be defined."

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is not as pure of a computation as say, as in the discovery of the circle resulting from the observation of the Weltlalls.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is a human construction that we consider useful.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, there are other ways to measure an average to find a "typical" or average.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The other, very typical way is the median value), and I write in pink median.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And median means for the average number.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you arrange all your numbers and find the mean, which is the median.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what is the median of this data set?

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what is the median of this data set?

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We haben1 another 1, 3, 4, 6, and a seventh What is the middle number?

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We see that we have to pay an even number of, as there is no middle number, there are two middle numbers.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
, the 3 and the 4

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And in the case where you have two middle numbers, you take the middle between the two figures,

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ie the arithmetic mean of these two numbers, in order to find the median.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The median is in the middle DVON 3 and 4, that is 3.5. In this case, the median is therefore 3.5.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you have an even number of numbers, the median is the arithmetic mean of the two middle numbers.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you have an odd number of numbers, it is somewhat easier.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this I'll give you a different amount of data.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the amount of data and I have already ordered:

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Our data volume is 0,0,7, 50,10.000, and 1,000,000.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A crazy amount of data. In this situation, which is the median?

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have 5 numbers, an odd number. It's easy to dig out the We have 5 numbers, an odd number. It's easy to dig out the middle number.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The mean is the number that is greater than two of the numbers, and smaller than the other two.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is exactly the middle. In this case our median 50th

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, the third measure of a central cover is the least frequently used: the mode.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It sounds very complex, but it appears that it is the most fundamental idea: The mode is the most frequently occurring number in a data set.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what is the mode? If all values ​​occur only once, there is no modal.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But what is the mode in our data-set? We only have a 4, a 3, but we have 2 ones, we have a 6 and a 7

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The most frequently occurring number is the first So is the mode of the first

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We see that the different types to determine eien average, in very different ways and we will see in the study of statistics,

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that it is good for different things.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the most widely used for many different things,

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
, the median is important when you have a lot of crazy numbers to calm the arithmetic mean.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The mode can also be useful in such situations where a value occurs more than once.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, the time being it would be. In the next video we will explore the deeper statistics.
