1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,070
I will now introduce you to
the concept of tension.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,390
So tension is really just the
force that exists either

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,760
within or applied by
a string or wire.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,280
It's usually lifting something
or pulling on something.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,040
So let's say I had a weight.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,080
Let's say I have
a weight here.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,450
And let's say it's
100 Newtons.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,575
And it's suspended from this
wire, which is right here.

10
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:34,920
Let's say it's attached to
the ceiling right there.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,010
Well we already know that the
force-- if we're on this

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,390
planet that this weight is being
pull down by gravity.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,370
So we already know that there's
a downward force on

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,730
this weight, which is
a force of gravity.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,130
And that equals 100 Newtons.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,090
But we also know that this
weight isn't accelerating,

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,850
it's actually stationary.

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,040
It also has no velocity.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,570
But the important thing is
it's not accelerating.

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,080
But given that, we know that the
net force on it must be 0

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,950
by Newton's laws.

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,820
So what is the counteracting
force?

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,840
You didn't have to know about
tension to say well, the

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,300
string's pulling on it.

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,490
The string is what's keeping
the weight from falling.

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,920
So the force that the string or
this wire applies on this

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,460
weight you can view as
the force of tension.

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,400
Another way to think about it
is that's also the force

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,350
that's within the wire.

30
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,020
   

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,320
And that is going to exactly
offset the force of gravity on

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,700
this weight.

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,190
And that's what keeps this point
right here stationery

34
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,800
and keeps it from
accelerating.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,040
That's pretty straightforward.

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,640
Tension, it's just the
force of a string.

37
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,270
And just so you can
conceptualize it, on a guitar,

38
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:58,830
the more you pull on some of
those higher-- what was it?

39
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,820
The really thin strings that
sound higher pitched.

40
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,040
The more you pull on it,
the higher the tension.

41
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,780
It actually creates a
higher pitched note.

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,210
So you've dealt with
tension a lot.

43
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,260
I think actually when they sell
wires or strings they'll

44
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,730
probably tell you the tension
that that wire or string can

45
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,650
support, which is important if
you're going to build a bridge

46
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,980
or a swing or something.

47
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,170
So tension is something that
should be hopefully, a little

48
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,600
bit intuitive to you.

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,710
So let's, with that fairly
simple example done, let's

50
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,980
create a slightly more
complicated example.

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,900
So let's take the same weight.

52
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,720
Instead of making the
ceiling here, let's

53
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,510
add two more strings.

54
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,660
Let's add this green string.

55
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,770
   

56
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,010
Green string there.

57
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,610
And it's attached to the
ceiling up here.

58
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,970
That's the ceiling now.

59
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,530
And let's see.

60
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,630
This is the wall.

61
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,710
And let's say there's another
string right here

62
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,240
attached to the wall.

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,600
So my question to you is, what
is the tension in these two

64
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:08,620
strings So let's call
this T1 and T2.

65
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,470
Well like the first problem,
this point right here, this

66
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,430
red point, is stationary.

67
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,820
It's not accelerating in
either the left/right

68
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,570
directions and it's not
accelerating in the up/down

69
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,260
directions.

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,400
So we know that the net forces
in both the x and y

71
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,560
dimensions must be 0.

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,950
My second question to
you is, what is

73
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,950
going to be the offset?

74
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,770
Because we know already that
at this point right here,

75
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,330
there's going to be a downward
force, which is the force of

76
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,270
gravity again.

77
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,220
The weight of this
whole thing.

78
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,490
We can assume that the wires
have no weight for simplicity.

79
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,300
So we know that there's going
to be a downward force here,

80
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,920
this is the force of
gravity, right?

81
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,560
The whole weight of this entire
object of weight plus

82
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,200
wire is pulling down.

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,470
So what is going to be the
upward force here?

84
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,880
Well let's look at each
of the wires.

85
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,200
This second wire, T2, or we
could call it w2, I guess.

86
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,070
The second wire is just
pulling to the left.

87
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,335
It has no y components.

88
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:08,680
It's not lifting up at all.

89
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,590
So it's just pulling
to the left.

90
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,910
So all of the upward lifting,
all of that's going to occur

91
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,500
from this first wire, from T1.

92
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,430
So we know that the y component
of T1, so let's

93
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,395
call-- so if we say that
this vector here.

94
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:28,510
Let me do it in a
different color.

95
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,470
Because I know when I draw these
diagrams it starts to

96
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,720
get confusing.

97
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,460
   

98
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,940
Let me actually use
the line tool.

99
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,480
So I have this.

100
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,920
Let me make a thicker line.

101
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,120
So we have this vector
here, which is T1.

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,110
   

103
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,070
And we would need to figure
out what that is.

104
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,200
And then we have the other
vector, which is its y

105
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,890
component, and I'll draw
that like here.

106
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,640
   

107
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,890
This is its y component.

108
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,780
   

109
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,900
We could call this T1 sub y.

110
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,920
And then of course, it has an
x component too, and I'll do

111
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,360
that in-- let's see.

112
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,160
I'll do that in red.

113
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,170
Once again, this is just
breaking up a force into its

114
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,250
component vectors like we've--
a vector force into its x and

115
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,350
y components like we've been
doing in the last several

116
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,100
problems. And these are just
trigonometry problems, right?

117
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,990
   

118
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,920
We could actually now, visually
see that this is T

119
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,620
sub 1 x and this is
T sub 1 sub y.

120
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,130
Oh, and I forgot to give you an
important property of this

121
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,780
problem that you needed to
know before solving it.

122
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,820
Is that the angle that the
first wire forms with the

123
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,370
ceiling, this is 30 degrees.

124
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:58,470
So if that is 30 degrees, we
also know that this is a

125
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,240
parallel line to this.

126
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,880
So if this is 30 degrees,
this is also

127
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,290
going to be 30 degrees.

128
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,240
So this angle right here is also
going to be 30 degrees.

129
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,370
And that's from our-- you know,
we know about parallel

130
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,690
lines and alternate
interior angles.

131
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,870
We could have done
it the other way.

132
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,745
We could have said that if this
angle is 30 degrees, this

133
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:22,900
angle is 60 degrees.

134
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,620
This is a right angle,
so this is also 30.

135
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,620
But that's just review
of geometry

136
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,290
that you already know.

137
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,280
But anyway, we know that this
angle is 30 degrees, so what's

138
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,600
its y component?

139
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,460
Well the y component,
let's see.

140
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,090
What involves the hypotenuse
and the opposite side?

141
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,640
Let me write soh cah toa at the
top because this is really

142
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,920
just trigonometry.

143
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,670
soh cah toa in blood red.

144
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,730
So what involves the opposite
and the hypotenuse?

145
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,770
So opposite over hypotenuse.

146
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:55,310
So that we know the sine-- let
me switch to the sine of 30

147
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:05,630
degrees is equal to T1 sub y
over the tension in the string

148
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,610
going in this direction.

149
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:15,730
So if we solve for T1 sub y we
get T1 sine of 30 degrees is

150
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,870
equal to T1 sub y.

151
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,210
And what did we just say
before we kind of

152
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,990
dived into the math?

153
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,600
We said all of the lifting on
this point is being done by

154
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,550
the y component of T1.

155
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,310
Because T2 is not doing any
lifting up or down, it's only

156
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,920
pulling to the left.

157
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,590
So the entire component that's
keeping this object up,

158
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,770
keeping it from falling
is the y component of

159
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,040
this tension vector.

160
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,930
So that has to equal the force
of gravity pulling down.

161
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,840
This has to equal the
force of gravity.

162
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,710
That has to equal this
or this point.

163
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,260
So that's 100 Newtons.

164
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,185
And I really want to hit this
point home because it might be

165
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:06,140
a little confusing to you.

166
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,810
We just said, this point
is stationery.

167
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not moving up or down.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,720
It's not accelerating
up or down.

169
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,540
And so we know that there's a
downward force of 100 Newtons,

170
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,480
so there must be an upward force
that's being provided by

171
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,800
these two wires.

172
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,150
This wire is providing
no upward force.

173
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,140
So all of the upward force must
be the y component or the

174
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,350
upward component of this force
vector on the first wire.

175
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,309
So given that, we can now solve
for the tension in this

176
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:39,409
first wire because we have
T1-- what's sine of 30?

177
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,050
Sine of 30 degrees, in case you
haven't memorized it, sine

178
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,990
of 30 degrees is 1/2.

179
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:52,640
So T1 times 1/2 is equal
to 100 Newtons.

180
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,200
Divide both sides by 1/2
and you get T1 is

181
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,350
equal to 200 Newtons.

182
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,800
So now we've got to figure out
what the tension in this

183
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,870
second wire is.

184
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,790
And we also, there's
another clue here.

185
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,640
This point isn't moving left
or right, it's stationary.

186
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,970
So we know that whatever the
tension in this wire must be,

187
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,120
it must be being offset by a
tension or some other force in

188
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,260
the opposite direction.

189
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,150
And that force in the opposite
direction is the x component

190
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,220
of the first wire's tension.

191
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,140
So it's this.

192
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,200
So T2 is equal to the
x component of the

193
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,990
first wire's tension.

194
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,410
And what's the x component?

195
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,520
Well, it's going to be the
tension in the first wire, 200

196
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,250
Newtons times the cosine
of 30 degrees.

197
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,900
It's adjacent over hypotenuse.

198
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,320
And that's square root
of 3 over 2.

199
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,410
So it's 200 times the square
root of 3 over 2, which equals

200
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,590
100 square root of 3.

201
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,940
So the tension in this wire is
100 square root of 3, which

202
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,590
completely offsets to the left
and the x component of this

203
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,540
wire is 100 square root of
3 Newtons to the right.

204
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,446
Hopefully I didn't
confuse you.

205
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:19,250
See you in the next video.
