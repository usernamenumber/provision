99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's now use what we know about the Chain rule and the Product rule

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
To take the derivative of an even weirder expressions.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are going to take the derivative of e^cos(x) times cos(e^x)

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's take the derivative of this.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we can view this as the product of two functions,

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the product rule tells us that this is going to be the derivative with the respect to x

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of e^cos(x) times cos(e^x) plus the first function

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just e^cos(x) times the derivative of the second function cos(e^x)

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so we just need to figure out what these two derivatives are.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we can use the Chain Rule here.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just to make it clear, we got this from the Product Rule.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But then to evaluate each of these derivatives, we need to use the Chain Rule.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's think about this a little bit.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's think about what the derivative of this function is.
