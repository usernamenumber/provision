1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,700
A bead artist drills a tiny hole
from the top corner of a

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,110
cube bead to the opposite bottom
corner of that bead.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,450
It's a cube bead.

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,130
Each edge of the bead
is 1/2 centimeters.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,910
How long is the hole
that she drilled?

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,280
So if I'm interpreting this
properly, let me draw that

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,590
cube bead, which I will
just draw as a

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,080
cube, a big cube here.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,750
Nicer cubes have been drawn in
the history of cube drawing,

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,540
but I'll try my best.
So let's see.

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,140
This is my best shot
at a freehand cube.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,730
I think that does the
job reasonably well.

14
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,170
If this cube was transparent,
you could even imagine kind of

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,030
that backside over there, and
the base of the cube if this

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,680
was a transparent cube.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,050
They tell us that each edge of
this cube bead-- they call

18
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,910
this a cube bead-- each edge
of the cube bead is 1/2

19
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,450
centimeter.

20
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,080
So this is 1/2 centimeters, this
is 1/2 centimeters, and

21
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,030
that is 1/2 centimeters.

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,480
And then they say that they
drilled a hole from the top

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,680
corner of a cube bead to
the opposite bottom

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,590
corner of the bead.

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,430
From the top corner to
the opposite bottom.

26
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,160
So I think they're talking about
the longest diagonal

27
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,530
that can fit in the cube.

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,480
Going from the back, right top
corner, over here, to the

29
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,100
front, left bottom corner, right
over there, that's the

30
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,640
longest diagonal
that could fit.

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,670
So let me draw that.

32
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,130
So it would look something
like this.

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,100
This is the distance
in question.

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,810
How long is the hole
that she drilled?

35
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,390
That is the distance that
we have to figure out.

36
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,120
And let's see how we can
think about that.

37
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,330
And this is a bit of a
classic in terms of

38
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,210
figuring out a distance.

39
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,650
The longest diagonal of
a cube or some type of

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,050
a rectangular prism.

41
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,180
And the trick here is to see
that this is the hypotenuse of

42
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,560
a triangle, although the
triangle isn't completely

43
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,270
obvious to you just yet.

44
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,660
And to think about this as
the hypotenuse of a right

45
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,770
triangle, what you have to do
is visualize the diagonal of

46
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,440
the bottom face of this cube.

47
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,400
Think about this diagonal right
here that I'm drawing.

48
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,850
So the diagonal of the bottom
face of this cube.

49
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,720
If you think of it that way,
then all of a sudden we have a

50
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,790
right triangle that's kind of
going across this cube.

51
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,560
This is a right angle
over here.

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,070
We know what this length is.

53
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,380
This is 1/2 centimeters.

54
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,030
If we could figure out the
length of this orange side

55
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,020
right here, this part that's
going diagonally across the

56
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,370
base of the cube, then we could
use the Pythagorean

57
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,080
theorem to figure out what the
distance in question is, this

58
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,930
longest diagonal of the cube.

59
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,960
Now, to figure out this orange
side, you just have to

60
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,830
visualize the base
of this cube.

61
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,700
Let's look at this base.

62
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,600
If we were just in the cube
looking straight down at the

63
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,380
base, it would look something
like this.

64
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,600
You'd have this side-- let me
color code them; it will make

65
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,470
it easier to visualize I think--
you have this side

66
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,155
right here, which I will
do in this blue color.

67
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:47,920
So I'll draw it over here.

68
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,100
You have this side in
that blue color.

69
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,000
And then you have this side over
here, which I'll do in

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,650
the magenta color.

71
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,470
You have the side over there
in the magenta color.

72
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,310
They're both of length 1/2, so
I'll draw them with roughly

73
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,650
the same length.

74
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,070
And then you have this orange
side that goes across to the

75
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,220
bottom of the base
of the cube.

76
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,080
And I'll do it as the same
orange dotted line right

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,175
there, just like that.

78
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,400
Let me extend this side
a little bit.

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
And we know this is
a right angle.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,987
This is a cube we're
dealing with, so

81
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:19,000
this is a right angle.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,690
We know that this side
is 1/2 centimeter.

83
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,000
We know that this side right
over here is 1/2 centimeter.

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,810
So if we wanted to figure out
this diagonal or this length

85
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,540
right here, we can just use
the Pythagorean theorem.

86
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,780
We know that 1/2 squared-- if we
called this, I don't know,

87
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,730
if we called this right here
x-- we know that x squared,

88
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,860
the hypotenuse squared, is equal
to the the sum of the

89
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,640
squares of these two guys,
is equal to 1/2

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,890
squared plus 1/2 squared.

91
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,890
Or if we want to solve for x, we
could say x is equal to the

92
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,535
square root-- what's
this going to be?

93
00:03:56,535 --> 00:04:01,210
The square root of 1/4, That's
1/2 squared, plus 1/2 squared,

94
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,680
which is 1/4.

95
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,530
Or, what's 1/4 plus 1/4?

96
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,100
So x is equal to the square root
of 1/4 plus 1/4, that's

97
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,770
2/4, or 1/2.

98
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,910
Or you could write that as 1
over the square root of 2.

99
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,990
Now, we could rationalize this,
but I'll leave it like

100
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,589
that for now.

101
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,990
It'll keep things simple.

102
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,550
So this distance right here is
1 over the square root of 2,

103
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,780
or we could say this distance
right over here is 1 over the

104
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,620
square root of 2.

105
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,900
So if we were to draw the
right triangle where the

106
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,810
hypotenuse is the length of that
hole, let me draw that

107
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,910
right triangle.

108
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,070
So we have our hypotenuse,
which is this

109
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,660
long thing over here.

110
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,980
Let me just draw it like this.

111
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,490
That long thing over there.

112
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,780
We have this side over
here in yellow.

113
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,600
This side right here.

114
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,970
We have that side right there.

115
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,510
It is of length 1/2
centimeters.

116
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,840
And then we have the side we
just figured out, this side

117
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,250
right here, that x side.

118
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,500
This right over here.

119
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,460
   

120
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,690
This side over here, it
is a right angle.

121
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,490
We just figured out
this length.

122
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,510
It is 1 over the square
root of 2 centimeters.

123
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,750
   

124
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,250
Now, to figure out the length of
the hole, we can apply the

125
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,370
Pythagorean theorem again.

126
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,360
This is, let me say
h for hole.

127
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,050
Length of hole.

128
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,720
Actually, even better,
let's say l.

129
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,500
l for length.

130
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,070
Then we can say that l squared
is going to be equal to 1 over

131
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,510
the square root of 2 squared--
we're just applying the

132
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,920
Pythagorean theorem--
plus 1 squared.

133
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,370
And once again, we know that
this is the longest side.

134
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,220
It's opposite the right angle.

135
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,200
So it's going to be the
sum of the squares of

136
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,730
the other two sides.

137
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,480
And so that's going to be equal
to-- so we get l squared

138
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,500
is equal to-- what's 1 over the
square root of 2 squared?

139
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,785
Well, 1 squared is 1, over the
square root of 2 squared is 2.

140
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:02,070
And then you're going to
have plus 1/2 squared.

141
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,860
1/2 squared is plus 1/4.

142
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,020
So l squared is equal
to 1/2 plus 1/4.

143
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,140
1/2 plus 1/4 is what?

144
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,920
Let's do it over here.

145
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,570
1/2-- we can write it as 2/4--
plus 1/4 is equal to 3/4.

146
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,000
So this right here
is equal to 3/4.

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,200
So we have l squared-- I changed
the shades of green

148
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,240
just there-- is equal to 3 over
4, so l is equal to the

149
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,330
square root of 3 over 4.

150
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,480
So we take the square root of
both sides, you get l is equal

151
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,930
to the square root of 3 over
the square root of 4.

152
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,240
What's the square root of 4?

153
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,660
The square root of 4 is 2.

154
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,910
And we're done.

155
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,910
The length of the hole that was
