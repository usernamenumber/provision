1
00:00:01,017 --> 00:00:03,077
PROBLEM: Choose the right number of each

2
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:07,668
place value to make 8129.123.

3
00:00:07,668 --> 00:00:12,266
So for the .123 part, we could say it is 123 thousandths.

4
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:13,042
Or we could say it is

5
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:17,526
1 tenth, 2 hundredths, and 3 thousandths.

6
00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:19,350
So let's just go place by place.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,606
So first, we have 8.

8
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:22,386
This 8 right over here is in the thousands place.

9
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:24,757
It represents 8 thousands.

10
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:25,823
So we're going to have 8,000.

11
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:31,362
So let's select (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) 8 thousands.

12
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:33,032
Then we have 1 hundred.

13
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:33,841
So we literally just have

14
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:35,867
only 1 hundred right over there.

15
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:37,125
Then we have 2 tens.

16
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,249
This 20 is 2 tens.

17
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:40,186
So we're going to need 2 tens.

18
00:00:40,186 --> 00:00:42,457
Then this 9, well that's just 9 ones.

19
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:48,188
So it's (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ) 9.

20
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:50,328
And now we're going into the tenths place.

21
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:52,582
This is only 1 tenth. So 1 tenth.

22
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:53,917
We'll write it like that.

23
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:56,387
Now this is 2 hundredths.

24
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:57,982
So we're going to put 2 hundredths there.

25
00:00:57,982 --> 00:01:00,132
Then finally, 3 thousandths.

26
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:02,384
(1, 2) 3 thousandths.

27
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:03,134
And we check our answer.

28
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:05,109
And we got it right.
