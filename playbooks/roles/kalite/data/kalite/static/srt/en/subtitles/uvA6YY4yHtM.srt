00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,449
There's nothing subtle about 17th century Dutch genre painting.

2
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:14,367
So often we're shown interactions that are wonderfully bawdy and wonderfully explicit.

3
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:22,301
There is an exception, however: Jan Vermeer's paintings often are riddles, they give us suggestions of narratives.

4
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:27,715
And in this painting it's true, we're not really sure exactly what's about to unfold.

5
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:32,468
What we're seeing is a man who is still wearing his hat and outer cloak.

6
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:37,706
He stands beside a table with a beautiful carpet on it, and he has his hand on a jug of wine.

7
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:41,399
He looks like he's ready to refill the young woman's glass.

8
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,772
She's got it up to her mouth and she's just finishing it off.

9
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:51,585
Well, and he looks impatient to pour her another glass, as though the goal of this whole interaction is to get her drunk.

10
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:55,064
But across from her, at the window that is ajar,

11
00:00:55,064 --> 00:01:03,837
we can actually see a rendering in the stained glass of temperance, of moderation, in a sense an instruction to her to watch her step.

12
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:15,104
And so the painting is about possibility, it's about her choice, and the man whose face is shadowed by his hat is a little bit sinister in that way.

13
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:21,654
There's a sense of distance between the two figures, a sense that they're not terribly familiar with one another

14
00:01:21,654 --> 00:01:25,375
and I almost wonder whether the wine is gonna make that happen.

15
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:33,072
One of the reasons that the flirtation doesn't have an opportunity to be represented is because he's in shadow, we can just barely make out his eyes

16
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:40,769
and her eyes are completely obscured by the shine in the beautifully delicate glass that she holds in front of her face.

17
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:46,573
She can't speak now, she's drinking, and she can't even see behind that glass, or at least, we can't see.

18
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:51,859
And yet that shine is all about vision, and it's held right at her eyes.

19
00:01:51,859 --> 00:02:00,359
This is an early Vermeer, but already we can see his fascination with soft light: look at the way it infuses the space, comes through that blue curtain

20
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:08,860
and the delicacy that he's lavished on the tonality of the back wall and the other forms in this room, it's just spectacular.

21
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,345
Well, Vermeer is interested in light. We also have that characteristic geometry in the composition:

22
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:18,660
the square of the window that's open,

23
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,590
the rectangle of the frame on the back wall,

24
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,512
the square on the back of the chair,

25
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:29,727
and the squares that move back and the perspective on the floor.

26
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:37,449
There is this kind of checkerboard pattern that does create a clear, structured interior, and then we have objects that are placed askew of that

27
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:45,172
so, you've got the line the window should trace, but the window is open, so that there's a diagonal that interrupts it.

28
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:52,956
You've got the careful rectilinear tiles on the floor but then you've got the chair, again, that's at an angle, and is offset from it.

29
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:57,279
In some ways this painting is about the disruption of order

30
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:04,895
and the way objects are placed in this space are about the tension that's created when things are not aligned.

31
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:08,956
Perhaps that functions of a kind of metaphor for the interaction between the two figures.

32
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:12,175
Or a kind of foreboding about what may happen.

33
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,439
There are ways that the figures are linked.

34
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:20,475
Look at the concentric rings that fall from the man: you have his collar,

35
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:27,527
then you've got a series of folds in the drapery that catch the light and sort of expand as they move down towards his arm.

36
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:35,744
And then that motion is picked up by the beautiful gold brocade in the woman's dress, and then the folds on her hip.

37
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:45,438
And so there really is a kind of harmony between those figures, and in some ways this painting is about harmony and disharmony, it's about alignment and things being askew.

38
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:56,162
And that's also symbolized in the musical instrument which is used in Vermeer's paintings to suggest both harmony and frivolity, so which way is this gonna go?

39
00:03:56,162 --> 00:04:00,677
I'm not sure! I think Vermeer is leaving that question open for the viewer.

40
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:06,974
By leaving this question open, Vermeer creates an image that is really poetic.
