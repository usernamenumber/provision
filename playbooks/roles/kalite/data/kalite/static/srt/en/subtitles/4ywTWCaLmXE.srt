A recipe for oat meal cookies calls for 2 cups of flour

2
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:09,800
for every 3 cups oatmeal. How much flour is required

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,467
for a big batch which uses 9 cups of oatmeal.

4
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:31,800
So 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of oatmeal.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:45,000
Now we are going to a situation where we are using

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:58,400
9 cups of oatmeal. I will let you know a couple

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,133
of different ways we can think about it. One way to think

8
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:08,933
about this is we know if we use 3 cups of oatmeal ,

9
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:11,267
we need 2 cups of flour. We do not know

10
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,067
how much is required if we use 9 cups of oatmeal

11
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:19,733
If we are going from 3 cups to 9 cups of oatmeal

12
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:22,733
how much more oatmeal we are using?

13
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:32,000
we are using 3 times more , 3 x 3 = 9

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,667
If we want to use flour in the same proportion

15
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:38,467
we need to use, 3 times the flour

16
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:53,267
we need flour times 3 ; 2x3 = 6 cups of flour

17
00:01:53,267 --> 00:02:00,533
Another way to think about it

18
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:16,067
You can say 2 cups of flour over 3 cups of oatmeal

19
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:36,400
is equal to ? cups of flour over

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:45,267
9 cups of oatmeal. I like the first way of doing it

21
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:54,333
It is common sense. If you triple the oatmeal, you have to triple the flour.

22
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,000
Once youset up an equation like this, is

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,600
to use a little bit of algebra.

24
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,000
In cross multiplication, whenever you set a proportion

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:43,400
like this, 2 x 9 = ? x 3 or we get 18 = ? x 3

26
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,200
so the number of cups of flour we need to use

27
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,333
times 3 needs to be 18. You divide both

28
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,667
sides by 3 to get the answer which is 6

29
00:03:55,667 --> 00:04:03,267
So we get ? = 6 cups of flour.

30
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:07,200
You might we wondering cross multiplication does not

31
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,733
make sense. If you have setup a proportion like this,

32
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:20,133
why should cross multiplication work. That comes from algebra.

33
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:25,733
I am going to rewirte this part as x to simplify

34
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:32,667
we have 2/3 = x/9.

35
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:36,067
In algebra, all we are saying this quantity over here

36
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,467
is equal to this quantity over there.

37
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:44,133
If you do anything to the left , we need to do the

38
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:50,533
same thing to the right to keep it equal.

39
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:53,133
So what can we multiply this by, so that

40
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:56,800
we are left with just "x".

41
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,733
So we multiply this times 9, If you multiply right side

42
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:12,733
by 9, you need to multiply the left by 9

43
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:15,000
for both sides to be equal.

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,467
on the right hand side the 9 cancel out, you are

45
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:27,467
left with x. On the left hand side, 9*2/3 = 18/3 = 6

46
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:36,333
So these are all legitimate ways of doing this.

47
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,400
For really simple problems like this

48
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,133
you can use common sense. If you are increasing

49
00:05:41,133 --> 99:59:59,999
oatmeal by 3 times, increase flour also by a factor of 3
