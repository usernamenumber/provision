3
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:06,977
We're in the Altes Museum in Berlin and

4
00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:12,251
we're looking at their incredible Medea sarcophagus.

5
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:16,095
Now, this is one of the earliest heavily carved sarcophagi,

6
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:20,463
at a time when burials were just beginning in ancient Rome.

7
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:24,909
Before that usually the bodies of the deceased were cremated.

8
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:27,645
So this is a really early carved sarcophagus,

9
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:29,483
and it's a real show-stopper.

10
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:31,537
So it's marble, and it's deeply carved.

11
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:35,695
It's relief sculpture, but the figures are almost carved in the round in many places.

12
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:39,854
The sarcophagus tells the tragedy of Jason and Medea.

13
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:43,450
And this comes down to us from a play by Euripides.

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,770
The story is read from left to right,

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,035
and it tells the story in four parts.

16
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:52,609
On the extreme left is this magnificent rendering of Jason.

17
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,390
You might be familiar with the story of Jason and the Argonauts,

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,890
and Jason stealing the Golden Fleece -- with the help of the king's daughter,

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,436
and the king by the way was the owner of the Golden Fleece,

20
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,332
Jason is able to make off with it.

21
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:08,352
In the meantime the king's daughter, Medea, fell in love with Jason,

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,489
and she fled with him back to Greece with the Golden Fleece.

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,087
and they lived happily together for 10 years.

24
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:18,731
The problem came when Jason decided he wanted to leave Medea

25
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:21,452
and marry someone else - Creusa.

26
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:25,914
We see Jason on the far left, looking down at his two children,

27
00:01:25,914 --> 00:01:30,768
who are bringing Creusa, his new bride, their bridal gift from Medea -

28
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:33,915
a beautiful crown and a sumptuous gown.

29
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:38,615
The problem was that Medea was extremely jealous of Jason's new wife.

30
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:42,788
And although she seems to accept this new fate,

31
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:47,725
and in fact gives Jason these presents, she was plotting her revenge.

32
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:50,709
And so Creusa looks down at the two children.

33
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:53,027
She's in her father's palace.

34
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:55,853
We see some garlands and columns in the background.

35
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:58,546
She looks regal. She is enthroned.

36
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:00,162
And just look at the beautiful carving

37
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,995
and the way in which her body is revealed by the almost wet drapery there,

38
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,693
which might recall an earlier Greek style.

39
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,411
Her left arm reaches back behind her

40
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:14,061
and overlaps with the next scene where we see Jason again.

41
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:16,844
And in this scene we see the climax of the story.

42
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:17,344
The garments that the children have brought to Creusa are really a present from Medea.

43
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:26,678
And as soon as Creusa puts them on they burn Creusa to death.

44
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:30,578
Her father tries to save her and is burned to death as well.

45
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:34,896
So we have the unfolding of this terrible plot, this terrible kind of revenge.

46
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:41,627
And Jason looks on from the left. The father pulls his hair out as he watches his daughter burn.

47
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:52,360
Creusa forms this remarkable figure. Her arms lifted. her hair streams behind her. Her drapery almost reads as flames enveloping her.

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,662
There's a real sense of desperation. And look at the way her palms are opened up towards us.

49
00:02:56,662 --> 00:03:02,972
Her mouth opens a little bit wider, and there really does seem to be this sense of horror, this sense of desperation.

50
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:10,001
Parts of this are carved so deeply, for example her arm is completely removed from the background.

51
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:14,179
And so she really emerges as an almost complete three-dimensional figure.

52
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:20,682
It's exceptional carving. The sense of emotion. The sense of intensity. The sense of action, even though this is a piece of stone.

53
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:28,889
In the third scene out of four, we see Medea looking down at her two children, who are carelessly playing ball.

54
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:34,023
But this is not an innocent moment for Medea because she's already plotting to kill them.

55
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:38,675
In her revenge for Jason she kills her own children.

56
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:42,236
So we really see the tragedy deepening here.

57
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:49,660
Look at her face. There is this sense of action in her hands as she pulls the sword from its sheath.

58
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,454
But she seems to cock her head down in a mournful way.

59
00:03:53,454 --> 00:04:02,907
In this last scene we see Medea. She's able to escape thanks to the intervention of the God Helios, who lends her his chariot and flies her away.

60
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:15,005
And you can see her actually being lifted off the ground, her body forming a diagonal, with one of her dead children over her left shoulder and the other child's legs are visible in the chariot below.

61
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:21,989
You know, the story is so intense. One wonders why this would be chosen for a sarcophagus.

62
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,553
It was common for Greek mythology to be illustrated on sarcophagi.

63
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:29,423
But this tragic story of Medea. Why would you choose that?

64
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:39,768
One thought is that the person who died, whose sarcophagus this was, had died before her own marriage and would be unable to have children herself.

65
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:47,390
And so perhaps a kind of personal tragedy that can be expressed in mythological form in this classic narrative from Euripides.

66
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:55,996
