1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,841
SAL KHAN: So first of all,

2
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:03,873
I just want to thank Elon for coming – hungry.

3
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:04,566
ELON MUSK: Absolutely.

4
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:05,353
SAL: You didn't even have dinner,

5
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:06,528
and we didn't even feed you properly.

6
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:07,722
ELON: Sorry to be a bit late.

7
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:08,275
SAL: Oh, no.

8
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,538
ELON: I just came from the Tesla factory in Fremont.

9
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:13,354
SAL: Yeah? Was something wrong? [LAUGHTER]

10
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:14,619
ELON: There's always something wrong.

11
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:15,548
SAL: Did you have to like –

12
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,198
ELON: At any given point,

13
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:17,369
there is always something wrong –

14
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:17,744
SAL: Yes.

15
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:19,981
ELON: – because there are just too many things going on.

16
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:20,428
SAL: Yeah.

17
00:00:20,428 --> 00:00:23,173
ELON: So, one of the trickest things about a car

18
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:26,167
is that there are thousands of individual components –

19
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:27,623
there are thousands of unique components.

20
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:29,011
And even if one of those things is missing,

21
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:31,020
you can't make cars.

22
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,490
SAL:Yes.

23
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,758
ELON: So – I mean today's fiasco was -- I kid you not –

24
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:39,690
we were missing three-dollar USB cables.

25
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,611
So we cannot complete cars because –

26
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:45,401
SAL: Basically, the whole line was stopped.

27
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:46,862
ELON: Yeah. Essentially –

28
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:50,002
because it's part of the wiring harness.

29
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:54,049
So you can't put the interior in without this cable.

30
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:57,183
And so we can either make a whole bunch of cars –

31
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:58,161
minus the interior –

32
00:00:58,161 --> 00:00:59,540
which means that you got to stick them up in the yard –

33
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,263
SAL: The resale value would be no good.

34
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,933
ELON: It can be done, but --

35
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:07,405
the damned things go out of sequence –

36
00:01:07,405 --> 00:01:08,191
SAL: Right. Right.

37
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:10,838
ELON: and it's way more inefficient.

38
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,119
You don't have a moving production line,

39
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,626
so then you have to send people out

40
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:19,438
to hundreds of cars that are sort of sitting in the storage yard.

41
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:20,716
And so we –

42
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:22,579
This happens to be a particularly pernicious cable

43
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:27,564
that's kind of routed under the carpet and in a difficult place.

44
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:30,788
And it's literally three dollars.

45
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:35,370
So, we basically had to send people

46
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,868
throughout the Bay Area to go and buy USB cables.

47
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:38,937
SAL: Like, literally, Radio Shack –

48
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:40,590
ELON: At Fry's.

49
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,031
SAL: Oh. Fry's. That's better.

50
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:43,473
ELON: You could have a hard time getting

51
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:44,036
a USB cable right now at Fry's.

52
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:44,317
SAL: Oh, really?

53
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:44,599
ELON: We just bought every one of them.

54
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,854
SAL: That's good.

55
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:51,731
ELON: And so we were able to continue production.

56
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:52,428
I don't want to belabor the anecdote.

57
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:56,910
But essentially, the supplier is in China.

58
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,369
And we had Plan A and Plan B.

59
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,996
And Plan A was like the normal supply chain process.

60
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:07,240
But what the supplier did was,

61
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,941
instead of sending our parts in their own package,

62
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:12,860
they grouped it together

63
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,776
with a bunch of other stuff for other companies,

64
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:17,618
and sent that all via

65
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:21,472
some extremely slow boat from China to LA.

66
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:25,596
And when it got to LA, the other stuff didn't pass customs.

67
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:26,341
SAL: Ohhh.

68
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,902
ELON: So they wouldn't let our stuff through, because –

69
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:30,009
SAL: They put in like a barrel of fruit or something,

70
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,079
ELON: I don't know what they put it in.

71
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,829
It's something that Customs didn't like.

72
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,769
The paperwork wasn't in order, or wWhatever.

73
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,943
So it got stuck there for, like, a couple of weeks.

74
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:41,870
And then we had Plan B.

75
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,838
So we call them and say,

76
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:46,438
"Look, you've got to airfreight some of these cables –

77
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:49,039
some of these little cables – to us."

78
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,069
And we talked to their US subsidiary,

79
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,489
and ordered them from the US subsidiary,

80
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:56,489
who then communicated with [the supplier in] China.

81
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,796
But then, because this was another batch of parts –

82
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:02,409
so it was kind of double the [usual] order –

83
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:06,298
it exceeded the credit limit that we had.

84
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:06,969
SAL: Oh! Yeah. You've gotta –

85
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:07,640
ELON: So it bounced off their credit limit.

86
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,060
So they didn't ship it.

87
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,329
SAL: Fascinating! So someone's losing their job now.

88
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,859
Nah, I'm kidding. [LAUGHTER]

89
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:16,889
You shouldn't fire anyone.

90
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:17,920
ELON: I mean, it's pretty farcical.

91
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,782
Anyway, so It's coming, like, tonight at 11PM or something.

92
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:25,737
SAL: Wow.

93
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:30,757
And these things are, happening, like, all the time?

94
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:31,614
– or this is an unusual circumstance?

95
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:33,269
ELON: That's like one example but there are many things like that.

96
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,309
SAL: I guess I mean that's a really good example because that kind of leads into

97
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:39,009
what I've always been fascinated by a lot of what you're doing

98
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,709
is well I guess I will start with

99
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,113
how did you get into this? I mean you know..

100
00:03:46,113 --> 00:03:49,250
ELON: into cars?

101
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,763
SAL: Into cars, into taking over NASA?

102
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,276
into... well NOT taking over NASA...

103
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:54,385
of being a contractor for NASA...

104
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,510
ELON: Just for the record, we are not taking over NASA

105
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,778
SAL: Yes you are not taking over NASA.

106
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:59,143
They're an independent organization.

107
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:03,716
But you are becoming a major provider of services for NASA.

108
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:07,420
Obviously kind of internet payment and payments generally

109
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,092
I mean these are very... three completely different spaces

110
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:13,707
I think a lot of people would not take someone seriously

111
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:15,873
if they had a business plan in one of these.

112
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:17,462
ELON: Right.

113
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:19,110
SAL: Oh yeah, you can take your time

114
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,129
What was your...

115
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:25,089
I mean did you always think you're going to be doing this?

116
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,008
When did it dawn on you that

117
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:30,930
you would try to revolutionize three industries ?

118
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,550
ELON: Well, when I was in college

119
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,300
I didn't actually expect to do it.

120
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,669
So it was not like this is some long fulfilled expectation.

121
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,979
But when I was in college, I thought about

122
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,052
what were the areas that we most affect the future of humanity

123
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:46,371
and, in my opinion, and the three areas were

124
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:49,742
the internet, sustainable energy and space exploration.

125
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:51,889
Particularly if humanity would become multi planet species.

126
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,995
It's kind of like a pretty substantial bifurcation in our sort of future

127
00:04:56,995 --> 00:05:01,566
if we are either out there among stars from local planets

128
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:03,420
or if we're confined to a...

129
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,979
until some obviously eventual extinction.

130
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:07,802
Not that I am pessimistic about life on earth...

131
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:11,697
Things are likely to be good ... even more likely to be good by far

132
00:05:11,697 --> 00:05:14,934
SAL: Yellowstone's due for an explosion every 100s several 1000 years.

133
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:18,580
Someone knows about that ...

134
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,819
It's been 700,000 since ...

135
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,023
Right ...yeah...super volcano for those you don't know: it would envelope (the world).

136
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:27,674
ELON: Yeah exactly... I know exactly what you talked about...

137
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:29,503
SAL: We read the same books, I can tell.

138
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,062
ELON: Absolutely.

139
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:33,367
Something bad is bound to happen

140
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,687
if you give it enough time.

141
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:35,885
And civilization has been around

142
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:39,420
for such a very short period of time, that –

143
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,158
These time scales seem very long.

144
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:44,104
But on an evolutionary time scale

145
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:46,420
they're very short.

146
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,259
A million years on an evolutionary time scale

147
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,595
is really not much.

148
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:53,300
And the Earth's been around for 4 and 1/2 billion years.

149
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,870
So, that's a very tiny tiny amount of time, really.

150
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,909
But for us, that would be -

151
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,229
I mean, can you imagine if human civilization continued

152
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,297
at anything remotely [resembling] the current pace

153
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:05,002
of technological advance for a million years,

154
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:07,672
where would we be?

155
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:10,061
I think we're either extinct or on a lot of planets.

156
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:11,854
SAL: Yes. We should be.

157
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:13,014
ELON: These are our two options...

158
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:14,890
SAL: But given that. One: that's kind of as epic

159
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,750
as one can think about things – I mean, literally.

160
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,369
How did you make that concrete?

161
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:26,611
How does that turn into SpaceX, Tesla and PayPal?

162
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,778
ELON: Well, so I thought about these things

163
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:38,043
kind of in the abstract – not from the expectation

164
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:40,693
that I would actually have careers in those arenas.

165
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:45,726
But I wanted to be involved in at least one of them.

166
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:49,748
At first, I thought the best bet was going to be electric cars.

167
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:52,432
And so the area that I was studying

168
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:55,257
was advanced capacitors, right?

169
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:57,418
So essentially, those are capacitors that have

170
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,610
an energy density exceeding that of batteries –

171
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,898
because batteries have a very high-power density,

172
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:01,694
but low energy density.

173
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:02,430
SAL: Yeah.

174
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,628
[Maybe you should] have a lecture to that effect.

175
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:07,268
SAL: Oh yeah. We should do that – a little later –

176
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,248
ELON: [LAUGHS] Exactly.

177
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:12,203
So, obviously if you could make a capacitor

178
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:14,266
that had anywhere near the energy density of a battery –

179
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,176
with its incredibly high power density,

180
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:18,441
quasi-infinite cycle and calendar life,

181
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,763
then you'd have an awesome solution

182
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:23,762
for energy storage and mobile applications.

183
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:26,086
So, I was going to sort of work on that and try to

184
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:29,860
leverage the equipment that was developed

185
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,490
for advanced chip making and [??] –

186
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:38,654
to create ultra precise capacitors at the molecular level.

187
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:39,791
SAL: And this is when you were

188
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,370
going to go into grad school?

189
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,949
ELON: Yeah.

190
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:44,530
SAL: You had a brief stint at Stanford ...a PhD in Applied Physics

191
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,039
ELON: Applied Physics and Material Sciences... SAL: right this is what you were ...

192
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,680
even then you were thinking of kind of trying to do something in this space.

193
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,660
ELON: Well...actually this was

194
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,017
to work on energy storage solutions for electric cars.

195
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:55,529
SAL: Yeah.

196
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:59,596
ELON: And I actually worked at a company in Silicon Valley called Pinnacle Research

197
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:03,069
which did advanced capacitors.

198
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:10,192
There were electrolytic capacitors

199
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:14,150
and actually were pretty good. They had the energy density of a LED acid battery

200
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,799
which, for a capacitor, is a big deal.

201
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:20,359
But they used ruthenium titanium oxide.

202
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:22,199
And I think at the time

203
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,501
there was maybe one or two tons of ruthenium mined per year in the world.

204
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,877
So it's not a scalable solution.

205
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:31,389
But I thought there could be some solid state solution -

206
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:34,589
just like what I said - using chip-making equipment.

207
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:35,540
That was going to be the basic idea.

208
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,290
It was one of those things where

209
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,330
I wasn't sure if success was one of the possible outcomes.

210
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,823
You know... like you can't...

211
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,850
It's difficult to bound that problem exactly and say, "Okay..."

212
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,060
SAL: So you're saying, "I felt like this was a destined failure..."

213
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,851
It's another way to parse that sentence but anyway -

214
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,991
ELON: No I didn't think it would [necessarily] fail.

215
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,366
But I wasn't sure that success was a possibility.

216
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:59,130
SAL: OK yes.

217
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,772
ELON: You know, and generally,

218
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:06,343
[if] you want to embark on something, it's desirable to figure out

219
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:08,358
if success is at least one of the possibilities.

220
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:10,638
SAL: Right, exactly.

221
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,156
ELON: Because, for sure, failure is one of the possibilities.

222
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:13,696
SAL: Yes.

223
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:17,217
ELON: But ideally, you want to try to bracket it and say

224
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,229
success is in the envelope of outcomes.

225
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:21,697
SAL: Yeah

226
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:24,840
ELON: and I wasn't quite sure if that was the case.

227
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,700
I think success on an academic level would have been quite likely

228
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,904
because you can publish some useless paper.

229
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,080
And most papers are pretty useless.

230
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,655
SAL: We have a few: don't take offense.

231
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:40,130
ELON: I mean how many PhD papers are actually used

232
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,710
by someone ever?

233
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,577
SAL: That's a good point...

234
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:47,489
ELON: I mean, percentage wise it's not good

235
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:50,344
And so.... it could be one of those outcomes

236
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:56,033
where you add some leaves to the tree of knowledge.

237
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:59,619
And that leaf is: no it's not possible.

238
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:00,720
SAL: Right.

239
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,434
ELON: There goes 7 years of my life.

240
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:07,910
So that was sort of one path. I was prepared to do that.

241
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,520
But then the Internet was... the Internet came along it was like:

242
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,600
"Ok, the internet, I'm pretty sure success is one of the possible outcomes."

243
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,827
I could either do sort of a PhD and watch the Internet happen.

244
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:23,470
Or I could participate and help build it in some fashion, you know.

245
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,978
I just couldn't stand the idea of watching it happen.

246
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:27,814
Yeah,

247
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:30,936
So I decided to put things on hold

248
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,930
and start an Internet company.

249
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,020
And that was kind of...

250
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,577
We worked on Internet publishing software,

251
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:42,070
maps, directions, yellow pages kind of things.

252
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,058
We had as investors and customers

253
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:48,440
the media companies like New York Times company, Knight Ridder.

254
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,830
SAL: This was just the early stages. ELON: This was '95.

255
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:58,420
SAL: So its really early stages... so this [was] really out of the gate. ELON: Absolutely

256
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,110
So then we ...

257
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,849
The reason that we worked with the media companies is

258
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:03,851
because we didn't have money.

259
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:07,037
Like there was no advertising money in '95. SAL: Right

260
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:10,800
ELON: In fact, the idea of advertising on the Internet seemed like ridiculous to most people.

261
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,000
Obviously it's not ridiculous anymore. But

262
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,960
at the time it seemed like a very unlikely proposition.

263
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,600
A lot of the media companies weren't even sure that they should be online.

264
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,260
Like what's the point of that?

265
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,390
SAL: And did you all think that PayPal was going to be, you know, a simple little Internet way

266
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,680
Or did you think it was going to turn into

267
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,630
the major kind of transaction processing engine that it is right now?

268
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,707
ELON: I didn't expect PayPal's growth rate to be what it was.

269
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,510
That actually created major problems.

270
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,020
We started PayPal on University Avenue.

271
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,870
After the first month or so of the website being active,

272
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,992
we had 100,000 customers.

273
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:48,690
SAL: Really that ... well wow I didn't realize that.

274
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,980
And how did it start? How did people even know to use it?

275
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,240
And, I mean, both buyer and seller have to be involved.

276
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,070
ELON: Yeah

277
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,210
Well we started off first by offering people $20 if they opened an account,

278
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,402
and $20 if they referred anyone.

279
00:12:04,402 --> 00:12:07,313
And then we dropped it to 10 dollars.

280
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:08,894
And the we dropped it to 5 dollars.

281
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,639
As the network got bigger and bigger,

282
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,828
the value of the network itself exceeded any sort of carrot that we could offer.

283
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:19,220
SAL: How much money did you spend with that kind of $5, $10, $20

284
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,740
incentive to get the critical mass going?

285
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,670
ELON: That was a fair amount ...I think it was probably

286
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,350
60 or 70 million dollars ... SAL: oh well so it was substantial.

287
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,264
So we're not talking peanuts here. This is ...

288
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:34,437
ELON: Yeah it depends on your relative scale.

289
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,092
It is a peanut to Google.

290
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:39,678
SAL: Yes well that's right, yes

291
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:42,125
ELON: I mean Google has got 50 billion.

292
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,092
Apple's got, I don't know, 150 billion some crazy amount of money.

293
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:47,261
That's cash... SAL: Yeah.

294
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:50,040
So that is not outlandish ... I didn't realize that was so core.

295
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,040
ELON: 1% of that would be 500 million dollars so it you know.

296
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,829
That's 0.1% of Google.

297
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,984
SAL: That's true. You are right. That's inexpensive.

298
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,029
ELON: Relative to that

299
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,440
proven pretty inexpensive.

300
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,050
SAL: That's right.

301
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,412
ELON: And then we did...we just did a bunch of things

302
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:07,510
to decrease the friction because -

303
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:14,120
and it's just like bacteria in a Petri dish -

304
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,219
what you want to do is try to have

305
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:22,559
one customer generate like two customers... SAL: yeah

306
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,576
ELON: Okay or something like that - or maybe 3 customers ideally.

307
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:29,500
And you want that to happen really fast,

308
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,686
and you can probably model it just like bacteria growth in a Petri dish.

309
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:39,569
It will just both expand very quickly until it hits the sides of the Petri dish.

310
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,000
And it slows down.

311
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,189
SAL: After PayPal then, I mean,

312
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:47,849
to some degree, especially in SiliconValley, you can understand the Internet.

313
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:53,786
We know people, I mean, PayPal is obviously onto the scale that is noteworthy.

314
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:57,080
But then Space X seems really, you know...

315
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,780
Well one, how did you decide, "I am definitely going to do that."

316
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,217
And then what's the first thing that you do?

317
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,060
Like how do you even like go out?

318
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,980
I don't even know how to start

319
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,050
trying to make a rocket company.

320
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,830
ELON: Neither did I really.

321
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,470
And in fact, the first 3 launches failed.

322
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,023
So it was[n't] like, you know, spot on -

323
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,260
did not hit the bull's eye.

324
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,410
SAL: But even getting to the point you're launching rockets. I don't even know how to

325
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,110
like how do you get there?

326
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,330
What did you do...like (1) what did you decide and what did you do on day one?

327
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,775
Like who would you call or did you write a plan, did you start...I don't even know.

328
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:36,960
ELON: Actually the urge of PayPal is ...oh Space X is that

329
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,000
I was trying to figure out why

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,650
that we have not sent any people to Mars

331
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,720
because the obvious next step after Apollo

332
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,060
was to send people to Mars.

333
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,540
But what in fact happened was that we sent a few people to the Moon

334
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,460
And then we didn't send anyone after that

335
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,890
to the Moon or Mars or anything.

336
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,150
But if you'd asked people in 1969

337
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,959
what would 2013 look like, they would have said

338
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,400
there'll be a base on the Moon.

339
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,240
There will be we would have at least sent some people to Mars

340
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,210
and maybe they'd even be a base on Mars offering space hotels

341
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,067
and there would be some stuff in space...Yeah.

342
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:13,535
And that's what people expected.

343
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:14,670
And if you said, well actually,

344
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,640
Unites States in 2013 will not be able to send anyone to orbit.

345
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,374
But I'll tell you what will exist is that there'll be this device in your pocket.

346
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:24,999
That's like the size of the...it's smaller than a deck of cards.

347
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,940
That has access to all the world's information.

348
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,252
You can talk to anyone on the planet Earth.

349
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:31,730
And even if you like in, you know,

350
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,479
some remote village somewhere, so long as...

351
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,482
something we called the Internet.

352
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:37,436
They wouldn't know what that means, of course.

353
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,470
Then you'd be able to communicate to anyone instantly

354
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,970
and have access to all of humanity's knowledge.

355
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,062
It's like bullshit. There is no way that's going to be.

356
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:48,608
SAL: Right right right

357
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:50,620
ELON: And yeah we already have that.

358
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,180
And space is not happening so

359
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,480
I was trying to figure out: what's the deal here?

360
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,860
This was 2001.

361
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,340
This friend of mine asked me what would I do after PayPal.

362
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,420
I said well you know I was always interested in space

363
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,536
but I don't think anything that an individual can do in space

364
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:07,610
because the province of government is usually large government.

365
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,573
But I'm curious as to when we're going to send someone to Mars.

366
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:12,540
so I went to NASA's website try to figure out

367
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,570
where is the place that tells you that.

368
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,807
I couldn't find that.

369
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:20,220
Either I'm bad at looking at the website or they have a terrible website.

370
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,179
Becasue surely ... SAL: that must be a big day

371
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:25,690
ELON: Yeah, this should be on the front page

372
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,709
And then I discovered actually that

373
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,690
NASA has no plans to send people to Mars

374
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,902
and or even really back to the Moon.

375
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,290
So this is really disappointing. I thought well maybe

376
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:44,000
this is a question of national will.

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,330
Do we need to

378
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,710
get people excited about space again?

379
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,780
And try to get NASA a bigger budget and

380
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,050
then we would send people to Mars?

381
00:16:53,056 --> 00:16:59,800
And so I started researching the area

382
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,330
becoming more familiar with space

383
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,740
reading lots of books

384
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,863
I came with this idea to do something called 'Mars Oasis'

385
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:10,550
which was to send a small green house

386
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,600
It was seasoned dehydrated gel, upon landing, you hydrated the gel

387
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,770
You have green plants in a red background

388
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,919
and the public is

389
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,910
the public response to precedents and superlatives.

390
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,536
It's the ... it would be the first life on Mars...

391
00:17:23,536 --> 00:17:25,359
The furtherest life has traveled

392
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,020
And you have this money shot green plants on the red background

393
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,890
That seem like

394
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,580
it would get people pretty excited

395
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,620
So that, I started getting into this

396
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,300
try to figure out okay

397
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,345
can I afford to build a spacecraft?

398
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:45,863
I had some money from PayPal

399
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,549
But it had to fit within that budget

400
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:50,860
I figure we have to do two missions because

401
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,075
if we only do one and fail

402
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:55,515
then it might have the opposite effect

403
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:58,744
SAL: You are willing to bet the farm so to speak on this...

404
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,570
ELON: yeah well

405
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,549
Yeah I figured like,

406
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:05,269
I was willing to spend half the money that I got from PayPal

407
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:06,961
with no expectation of return

408
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,631
SAL: Right

409
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:10,560
ELON: because i thought this was just something

410
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,230
that was pretty important and

411
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,260
I'm like

412
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,076
seem like I could spend half the money I made at PayPal on this

413
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:21,520
And if that got NASA a bigger budget...the result in us going to Mars

414
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,650
that would be a good...pretty good outcome

415
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,988
SAL: When your friends came and your family came up to you and said

416
00:18:24,988 --> 00:18:27,235
look you know there're nations that can't do this you know,

417
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:29,406
You are a guy and you have some resources

418
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:34,877
What did you say or do or think

419
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:38,900
ELON: I had a lot of friends of mine trying to talk me out of

420
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,870
starting a rocket company because they thought it was crazy

421
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,616
One of my friends maybe watch a video of rockets blowing up

422
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:50,450
There are just lots of people thought it was a real crazy idea

423
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,320
Some people tring to start rocket companies had not succeeded

424
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,039
And that they tried to talk me out of it and

425
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:56,899
but the thing is that

426
00:18:56,899 --> 00:18:59,311
the premise to talk me out of it was

427
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:01,514
"We think you're going to lose the money that you invest."

428
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:04,169
I was like yeah, well, that was my expectation anyway

429
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,160
So I don't really mind if I lose

430
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,480
I mind, but I mean it

431
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,592
It is not like I was trying to figure out

432
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:16,000
the rank or the best way to invest money right on that basis

433
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,440
So I chose space... thoughts like that

434
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,270
SAL: You weren't looking like the money market bonds

435
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:27,740
triple-A bonds, rocket company... ELON: real estate

436
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,600
invest in pew making or anything

437
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:37,791
Well the chase is just the highest ROI...that was not what I...what the fun is

438
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,820
I still thought that it was important that humanity expands beyond earth and

439
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,460
we weren't doing that. So maybe there are something I can do to

440
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,214
kinda spur...spur that on

441
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:52,546
I was able to compress the costs of the spacecraft and everything

442
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:54,659
down to a relatively manageable number

443
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,770
and I got stuck on the rocket

444
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,929
The US rockets were way too expensive

445
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:01,450
I ended up going to Russia and flew to Russia three times

446
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,429
to negotiate purchase of a ICBM

447
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:07,470
I tried to buy two of the biggest ICBMs in the Russian fleet

448
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,750
in 2001 and 2002

449
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,330
And actually the negotiator...

450
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:17,245
SAL: I just let those statements stand and I'm not even

451
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:18,690
ELON: That's...

452
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,124
SAL: Actually who did you call?

453
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:26,982
ELON: You open the yellow pages. Go to ICBMs

454
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:29,100
SAL: Like I mean how does this

455
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,461
And I don't get too much in the way..

456
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:32,510
And I am just curious about this one particular thing..you are...

457
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,409
You decided at some point you need to buy an ICBM

458
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:38,419
ELON: Yeah well actually at first I try to buy just the normal launch equipment

459
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,210
they use to launch satellites. Those were too expensive.

460
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,208
SAL: I see

461
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,340
ELON: The Boeing Delta II would have cost 65 million dollars each

462
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,128
and two would have been 130

463
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:52,270
and then I said well that breaks my budget right there

464
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,520
SAL: Yeah

465
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,912
ELON: And I tried to negotiate with them. I was not...

466
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:58,714
SAL: How much does an ICBM go for?

467
00:20:58,714 --> 00:21:03,055
I am curious about market rate for one of those.

468
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,000
This is right after the fall. It might have gone up.

469
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,039
ELON: It's gone up a lot since then.

470
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,560
In 2001 it would've been about ten million dollars each.

471
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,130
Two would be twenty and then

472
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,824
And I thought I could get the rest of the mission

473
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:21,800
down to also around 10 per.. so we would have

474
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,210
a dual mission with like two identical launches, two identical spacecrafts

475
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,623
for like roughly forty million dollars

476
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,695
So I thought that ok I can do that and

477
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:35,325
SAL: But you must have had some like you know

478
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:37,585
rocket scientists advising you at this point

479
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:39,654
I mean this sounds like you were serious

480
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:40,429
ELON: yeah

481
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:45,178
I engaged a bunch of circuit consultants.

482
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:50,300
I kind of start to get familiar with the space industry.

483
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,356
But then after the third trip to Russia

484
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:55,260
I came to realize that I was actually wrong about

485
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,670
my first premise -- that there was a lack of will.

486
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,050
In fact, I think that there is a tremendous amount of will

487
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,270
in the United States for outer space exploration.

488
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,162
Because the United States is essentially

489
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:08,536
a nation of explorers.

490
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,910
It's a distillation of the human spirit of exploration.

491
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,959
So of course, it was quite so silly of me to think

492
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:16,444
that people lack motivation.

493
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:19,590
But what people don't want to think is that

494
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,081
sending people to Mars is going to be so expensive

495
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:23,717
that they'll have to give up healthcare or something

496
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,445
SAL: Right

497
00:22:24,445 --> 00:22:28,434
ELON: They're not gonna do that.

498
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:29,997
So it's got to be [done in such a way] that

499
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:31,560
going to mars is not going to cause some

500
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:35,007
meaningful drop in their standard of living.

501
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:35,832
SAL: Right.

502
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:37,380
ELON: So it's like maybe

503
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,630
.25% to .5% of GDP – something like that is palatable.

504
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,931
Anyway so I thought ok it is not really gonna maybe matter that much

505
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,620
if I do this mission because

506
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,560
What really matters is having a way.

507
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,020
I was wrong, I thought I hope there was

508
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,250
there was enough will but actually there was plenty of will

509
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,960
if people thought there was a way.

510
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,790
So then I said, "Okay. I need to work on a way."

511
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,770
How hard is it really make a rocket?

512
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,600
"In history or historically all rockets have been expensive.

513
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,260
Therefore in the future, all rockets will be expensive."

514
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,050
But actuall, that's not true.

515
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,095
If you say, "What is a rocket made of?"

516
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,990
and say, "it's made of aluminum, titanium –

517
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,410
some copper –

518
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,419
carbon fibers, if you want to go that direction –

519
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:27,580
And you break it down and say,

520
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,018
"What is the raw material cost of all these components?"

521
00:23:30,018 --> 00:23:32,525
And if you have them stacked on the floor,

522
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,250
and could wave a magic wand,

523
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,470
so that the cost of rearranging the atoms was zero,

524
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,980
then what would the cost of the rocket be?

525
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,045
As I was like, "Wow. It's really small.

526
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,511
It's like 2 percent of what a rocket costs."

527
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,160
SAL: Right.

528
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,810
ELON: So clearly, [most of the cost comes from how expensive

529
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,317
it is to arrange those] atoms.

530
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:51,825
You got to figure out – sort of – how can we [go about getting]

531
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:55,906
the atoms [assembled] in the right shape

532
00:23:55,906 --> 00:24:01,756
much more efficiently.

533
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,693
SAL: Yeah.

534
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,606
ELON: So I had series of meetings

535
00:24:05,606 --> 00:24:06,973
on Saturdays with people, some of whom were working

536
00:24:06,973 --> 00:24:08,340
at the big aerospace companies,

537
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,289
just try to figure out if there is some catch here

538
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:12,159
that I am not appreciating.

539
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,029
SAL: Yeah.

540
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,864
ELON: I couldn't [find one].

541
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:14,700
It [didn't] seem that there [was] any catch, so ...

542
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,370
I started Space X.

543
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,564
SAL: And you ended up – you had some failures.

544
00:24:19,564 --> 00:24:21,460
But obviously some huge successes.

545
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,430
What was the cost that you were able

546
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,845
to build this rocket for –

547
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:27,260
relative to what they were being built for before?

548
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,559
ELON: So, let's see.

549
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,300
For the Falcon One –

550
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,218
which was the first rocket we built –

551
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:34,918
the first three fights did not make it. in fact –

552
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:39,116
Yeah. I mean we got progressively further,

553
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,109
But, like, the first rocket came in and [crashed] –

554
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,740
– landed maybe a couple of hundred yards

555
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,168
away from the launch site – in tiny fragments.

556
00:24:52,596 --> 00:24:53,820
So, anyway –

557
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,690
That rocket ended up costing around six million dollars –

558
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,184
SAL: Wow.

559
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,452
ELON: – compared to other rockets in that class –

560
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:05,438
which were about 25 million dollars.

561
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:06,756
SAL: Wow. That's [a] significant [saving].

562
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:11,555
ELON: Yeah. Like a quarter.

563
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:12,926
SAL: Wow. Wow.

564
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:14,298
ELON: But there is an even better step beyond that –

565
00:25:14,298 --> 00:25:16,179
which is to make rockets reusable.

566
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:19,220
So ... right now ... that is around

567
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,370
what our

568
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,210
comparison prices is, excluding the refurbished ICBMs

569
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,130
If you say

570
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,841
building rocket from new

571
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:31,086
how does this Space X rocket compared to a rocket from Boeing or Lockheed?

572
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:34,655
It's about a quarter of the price

573
00:25:34,655 --> 00:25:37,267
However if we make it reusable

574
00:25:37,283 --> 00:25:39,720
then it can be two orders of magnitude cheaper

575
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,600
SAL: Two orders of magnitude cheaper...100th the price... ELON: that is right

576
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,930
SAL: So I mean... ELON: for you

577
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,730
SAL: Only today ... Memorial Day sale (laughter)

578
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,419
What ...

579
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,669
I have seen some ..you are doing those vertical landings

580
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:58,291
yeah...like literally out of the 1950s

581
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:00,010
like sci-fi movies ELON: yep

582
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,140
SAL: and that's what you're talking about.

583
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,781
ELON: Essentially the rockets need to come back and land in the launch site

584
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:09,895
and then reload propellant, take off again like an airplane.

585
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:11,880
SAL: How far do you think we are from that?

586
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,315
When do you think like you know your best guess is

587
00:26:14,315 --> 00:26:16,068
when will we actually see that happening?

588
00:26:16,068 --> 00:26:18,088
ELON: And I hope we can do it next year.

589
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:19,590
SAL: Okay yeah that's...

590
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,398
We've got some ambitious stuff at the Khan Academy for next year too (laughter)

591
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:24,421
Just we can compare.

592
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:27,332
We're redesigning the site you know.

593
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,999
Right

594
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:33,500
ELON: We have been working for a long time

595
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,546
Space X has been around for 11 years

596
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:37,505
And thus far we have not recovered any rockets.

597
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:40,201
We've recovered the spacecraft from orbit.

598
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,570
So, that was great.

599
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:47,100
But none of our attempts to recover the rocket stages have been successful

600
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,720
The rocket stages have always blown up basically on reentry

601
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,553
Now we think we've figured out why that was the case.

602
00:26:55,553 --> 00:27:00,039
And it's a tricky thing because Earth's gravity is really quite strong

603
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:07,710
and with advanced rockets you can do maybe 2 to 3% of your lift off mass to orbit

604
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,630
typically

605
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,340
then reusability subtracts 2 to 3%

606
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,280
Then you go like nothing toward or negative

607
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,010
and

608
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,230
That's obviously not helpful

609
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,437
So the trick is to try to shift that from

610
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,120
say two-three percent

611
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,010
in and expendable configuration

612
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,510
put them to make the rocket

613
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,814
mass efficiency, engine efficiency and so forth

614
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:37,110
so much better that it moves to

615
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,843
around maybe 3.5 or 4% in an expendable configuration

616
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:43,191
And then try to be clever about the reusability elements

617
00:27:43,191 --> 00:27:47,320
Try to drop that to around the 1.5 to 2% level

618
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,139
So you have a net payload to orbit of about 2%

619
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:53,179
SAL: But you're doing it one...two orders of magnitude cheaper

620
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:55,260
ELON: Yeah absolutely because ...

621
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,210
our Falcon line of rocket costs about 60 million dollars

622
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,072
But the propellant cost which is mostly oxygen

623
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,830
it's two thirds oxygen one third fuel

624
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,290
is only about 200 000 dollars.

625
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,210
SAL: Wow.

626
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,130
It's much like a –

627
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:18,309
I guess 747. It costs about as much to refuel our rocket as it does to refuel 747

628
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:19,740
You know within

629
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,309
We are pretty close essentially

630
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:23,240
SAL: What happens, assuming you are all successful

631
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,720
you all prove yourself to be successful on these audacious things in the past

632
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,240
I mean what happens and that seems likeit's

633
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,710
What happens in the next 5-10 years in this space industry

634
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,620
if you all are successful there?

635
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,357
I mean, do we get to Mars?

636
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:38,086
Do we have kind of market forces

637
00:28:38,086 --> 00:28:41,250
commercialization of space starting to happen?

638
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,110
ELON: Yeah

639
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,633
Well the first step is that

640
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:50,495
we need to earn enough money to keep going as a company

641
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:55,496
So we have to make sure that we're launching satellites

642
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:59,510
commercial satellites so it's like

643
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,830
broadcast, communications, mapping

644
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,340
government satellites that do scientific missions –

645
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,032
earth-based or space-based missions, GPS satellites

646
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,653
that kind of thing.

647
00:29:11,653 --> 00:29:15,610
And also service space station transfer cargo to and from space station

648
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,880
which we have done a few times.

649
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,330
Then taking people to and from the space station

650
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:28,293
So we've got to service the earth-based needs to launch satellites

651
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,810
and that pays the bills

652
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,400
but in doing that

653
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,370
keep improving the technology

654
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:39,430
to the point where we can make full reusability work

655
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,900
and we have sufficient scale and sophistication

656
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,050
to be able to take people to Mars.

657
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,490
SAL: Wow, so you think this is going to be a reality.

658
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,392
What's your best guess

659
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:51,351
when we're going to have someone on Mars?

660
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:52,740
ELON: I think probably about twelve years

661
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,810
SAL: twelve... and you think it'll be a round trip

662
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,990
It will be to have some type of permanent colony on Mars that

663
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,409
ELON: I think it's probably a roundtrip

664
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:02,620
SAL: Wow

665
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,709
So... ELON: it's not for sure.... SAL: I could talk about this for...I mean

666
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:09,490
People know I am... ELON: aspirational to be a round trip.

667
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,598
SAL: This is mind-blowing.

668
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:13,523
And I mean on Tesla,

669
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:16,937
Tesla is obviously from our, from my vantage

670
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:18,770
It's a huge success and it's...

671
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,072
What do you think is in that industry...

672
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:25,840
I want to be asking the same question what do you think, you know

673
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,099
This is something GM, Toyota

674
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:31,360
these massive multi-billion dollar organizations have been trying

675
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,120
you know, what gave you the confidence to kind of pursue it?

676
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,145
And now that it seems to be a huge success

677
00:30:37,145 --> 00:30:40,380
where do you think this industry's going to be the next 5-10 years?

678
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,110
ELON: Yeah with Tesla

679
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:47,000
the goal is to try to accelerate

680
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,970
the advent of sustainable transport.

681
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,940
I think it would happen anyway

682
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,320
because it's just out of necessity

683
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,700
Because we have an unpriced externality

684
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,580
in the cost of gasoline

685
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,669
we weren't pricing in the environmental effects

686
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:02,224
of CO2 in the oceans [and] atmosphere,

687
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:05,421
that's causing the normal market forces

688
00:31:05,421 --> 00:31:07,682
not to function properly.

689
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:13,374
So the goal of Tesla is to try

690
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:14,982
to act as a catalyst to accelerate

691
00:31:14,982 --> 00:31:16,590
those normal forces, the normal sort of market reaction

692
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,070
that would occur.

693
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,616
We are trying to have catalytic effect on that

694
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:25,399
and try to make it happen – I don't know –

695
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:28,980
maybe 10 years sooner than it would otherwise occur.

696
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,667
Yeah that's the goal of Tesla.

697
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:33,750
So that's the reason I am making electric cars,

698
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,180
and not any other kind of car.

699
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:41,000
We also supply power trains to Toyota and to Mercedes

700
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,003
and maybe to other car companies in the future

701
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:49,110
to accelerate their production of electric vehicles.

702
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,700
So, that's the sort of goal there.

703
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,850
And so far it's working out pretty well.

704
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,000
SAL: I just saw in the news report the other day

705
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,206
that you sold more (Tesla) Model S-es than –

706
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:01,240
you're leading that segment of the industry –

707
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,999
that the Mercedes S class, the BMW 7 series,

708
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:06,720
the Lexus LS400 or whatever it is.

709
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,790
ELON: Yeah, actually, that seems to be the case.

710
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,530
And that's a

711
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,309
I didn't realize they sold so few cars in that segment.

712
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,803
SAL: That's

713
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:18,193
ELON: We are not selling that many cars.

714
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:19,888
We sold 5000 a quarter 12,000

715
00:32:19,888 --> 00:32:22,370
SAL: Well out here they seem like you know every ...

716
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,690
ELON: Yeah but this is our home team you know

717
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,860
So it's...

718
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,799
We better sell a lot out of the Bay Area

719
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,290
SAL: Yeah...no but that ...and

720
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,403
What I mean it seems similar thing. I mean what would...

721
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:36,415
How did you start?

722
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:37,914
What gave you the confidence?

723
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,295
And do you see yourself, I mean, is

724
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:42,119
kind of major automotive mainstream brand in 5 or 10 years?

725
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:46,985
all the way down to kind of competing with the Honda Accords and Civics?

726
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:50,851
ELON: Yeah I mean the goal is not to...

727
00:32:50,851 --> 00:32:54,622
it's not sort of to become a big brand

728
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:58,807
or to compete with Honda Civics.

729
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:02,440
We'd rather to advance the cause of electrical vehicles.

730
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,330
So, we're just gonna keep making

731
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,960
more and more electric cars

732
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,570
and driving the price point down.

733
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:14,920
So the industry is very firmly electric, you know.

734
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,749
Like maybe half of all cars made are electric –

735
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:18,894
or something like that.

736
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:20,039
Which is not to say we expect half of all cars.

737
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:24,016
We want to just have that catalytic effect

738
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:25,018
until at least that occurs.

739
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:26,020
I think the point which this

740
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,080
we're approaching half of all new cars made are electric,

741
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,030
then I think that's –

742
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,980
I'll consider that to be the kind of victory condition.

743
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,305
SAL: Wow.

744
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,630
ELON: And if so, the faster we can bring [about] that day,

745
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,019
the better.

746
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,409
SAL: When would be your guess when that happens?

747
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:46,100
ELON: I made a bet with someone about 3 years ago

748
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,148
that it would be sooner than 20 years.

749
00:33:48,148 --> 00:33:51,600
So it's 17 years from now.

750
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,534
But that's – I think – that's conservative.

751
00:33:54,534 --> 00:34:02,523
I think is probably maybe 13 or 14 years.

752
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:04,760
SAL: Wow, right about time – what happened

753
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,050
SAL: Right when we're going to Mars.

754
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,323
And it will be exciting times... yeah.

755
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:12,470
ELON: Absolutely true...it just could...

756
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,763
I also have been thinking about that:

757
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:17,059
it was like: those time frames are kind of a coincident

758
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:18,399
SAL: Yeah.

759
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,069
ELON: It's but yeah

760
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:24,129
I mean the nature of new technology adoption is it tends to follow an S curve

761
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,839
so what usually happens is people underpredict it in the beginning

762
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,659
because people tend extrapolate on a straight line.

763
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:32,759
And then they'll over predict that kind of midpoint

764
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:35,509
because there was late adopters and then

765
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:38,369
It'll actually take longer than people think

766
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:39,719
at the midpoint but

767
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,195
much shorter than people think at the beginning yeah

768
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,142
I am pretty excited about how things are going

769
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:48,689
It's...and in fact I think

770
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:52,849
that the pace of technology improvement is in energy storage

771
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:55,249
It is really

772
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:58,279
moving faster than anyone thinks ... SAL: wow

773
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:01,709
I got one or more ... what are we doing on time

774
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:04,580
9 o'clock how much time do you have?

775
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,269
ELON: I guess maybe another 15 minutes.

776
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:06,949
SAL: Okay

777
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:09,020
I'll finish with one last question before I open it up

778
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,714
What advice do you have for us at Khan Academy?

779
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:14,070
ELON: You guys are doing really great.

780
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,400
I was wondering if you had advice for me.

781
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,246
SAL: No

782
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:24,169
ELON: Yeah it seems like you are doing an amazing job of

783
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:27,637
really super leveraged, I mean, of this small team

784
00:35:27,637 --> 00:35:29,493
you have a dramatic effect upon

785
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:33,309
SAL: Half the people don't even work here ... right it's right

786
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:37,588
ELON: So it's a very impressive thing you are doing

787
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:43,005
to spread knowledge and understanding throughout the world

788
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:44,592
SAL: The universe soon –

789
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:47,559
if you hold up your end of the bargain here

790
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:48,639
ELON: Yeah.

791
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,819
I mean it's actually kind of funny ...

792
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:52,770
You know, if you think what is education?

793
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,988
You're basically downloading data and algorithms

794
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,536
into your brain.

795
00:35:59,536 --> 00:36:02,084
It's actually amazingly bad in conventional education.

796
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:04,609
It's like it shouldn't be this huge chore.

797
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:10,349
So you're making it way better.

798
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:13,206
But I think a lot of things I would say,

799
00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:19,288
you've probably heard a hundred times.

800
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:22,408
And, in fact, if not doing.

801
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:25,529
The more you can gamify the process of learning, the better.

802
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:28,729
For my kids,

803
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,044
I do not have to encourage them to play video games.

804
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:31,359
I have to like pry them from their hands –

805
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,559
like crack (illegal drugs).

806
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,869
"Drop that crack needle."

807
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:38,100
SAL: You have that problem at your house, too.

808
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:43,030
The crack is addictive.

809
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,450
ELON: You know it's the degree to which you can

810
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,609
somehow make learning like a game.

811
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:50,149
Then that's better.

812
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:54,723
And I think unfortunately a lot of education

813
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:56,767
is very vaudevillian.

814
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:58,799
You've got someone standing up there

815
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,129
kind of lecturing at people.

816
00:37:00,129 --> 00:37:01,459
And they've done the same lecture 20 years in a row.

817
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:03,520
And they're not very excited about it.

818
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,040
And that lack of enthusiasm is conveyed to the students.

819
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,150
Such that they're not very excited about it.

820
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,334
They don't know why they're there.

821
00:37:10,334 --> 00:37:11,460
Like, "Why we are learning the stuff?

822
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,304
We don't even know why."

823
00:37:13,304 --> 00:37:14,268
In fact, I think a lot of things people learn –

824
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:17,228
probably – there is no point learning them –

825
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,249
because they never use them in future.

826
00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:21,098
SAL: Because who's going to launch a rocket into space?

827
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:25,149
That's just like – exactly – that never happens.

828
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:28,061
ELON: Well, you have to say, like, if you'll go, stand back,

829
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:30,889
and say, "Why are we teaching people these things?"

830
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:31,910
And – we should tell them, probably,

831
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,779
why we are teaching these things.

832
00:37:33,779 --> 00:37:37,117
Because a lot of kids in school

833
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:40,690
kind of puzzled as to why they're there.

834
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,189
I think if you could explain the why of things

835
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:46,029
then that makes a huge difference to people's motivation.

836
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:47,589
They understand...

837
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:51,039
They understand purpose.

838
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:53,656
So that's pretty important.

839
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:54,849
Just make it entertaining.

840
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:58,187
But I think, just in general,

841
00:37:58,187 --> 00:38:00,445
conventional education should be massively overhauled.

842
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,704
And I'm sure you very much agree with that.

843
00:38:02,704 --> 00:38:04,869
The analogy I sometimes use is,

844
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:08,922
you've seen like Batman – like the Chris Nolan movie –

845
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:10,133
like the original one.

846
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:14,049
And it's pretty frickin awesome. Right?

847
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:15,429
You've got incredible special effects, great script

848
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:20,908
multiple takes, amazing actors, and great sound.

849
00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:23,128
It's very... is very engaging

850
00:38:23,128 --> 00:38:28,269
But if you would instead say okay that you have the same script

851
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:31,829
so at least the same script and you said ok now that script

852
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:34,749
instead of having movies, we're going to have

853
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:37,549
that script performed by the local town troupe.

854
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:40,839
Okay and so in every small town in America,

855
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:42,494
if movies didn't exist,

856
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,150
they'd have to, then, recreate the Dark Knight.

857
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,309
SAL: Right.

858
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,215
ELON: Like with home-sewn costumes, and, like

859
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:51,122
jumping across the stage –

860
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,627
not giving their lines quite right,

861
00:38:52,627 --> 00:38:56,909
and not really looking like the people in the movie.

862
00:38:56,909 --> 00:39:03,129
And no special effects – that would suck.

863
00:39:03,129 --> 00:39:04,244
It would be terrible.

864
00:39:04,244 --> 00:39:06,751
SAL: That's right. Very, very –

865
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:10,009
ELON: That's education.

866
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:13,450
SAL: So with that –

867
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,484
And I apologize to all of you guys for hogging up all the time.

868
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:15,519
Because obviously, I could talk for hours about this stuff.

869
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,299
But we do have time – I think 5 or 10 minutes – for a handful of questions.

870
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:23,329
If none of you all have any, I have about nine more. But yes –

871
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:27,882
QUESTION: So I noticed –

872
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:29,245
I picked up two kinds of themes from what you're discussing.

873
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:30,609
One was somewhat audacious goals.

874
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:34,229
And the other was

875
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:35,409
I don't think I heard you use the word 'profit'

876
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:36,589
in anything you spoke about.

877
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:40,659
You seemed to be – each thing is pointed at, like –

878
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:42,569
reinvigorating industry or

879
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:44,779
bringing back space missions –

880
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:49,893
How much of your success do you attribute to having really audacious goals

881
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:55,644
or versus just not being focused on the short term

882
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:59,376
you know money coming in or investors

883
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:02,427
ELON: Unfortunately, one does have to be focused on

884
00:40:02,427 --> 00:40:05,989
short term money coming in when creating company

885
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,959
because otherwise company would die.

886
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:13,019
So, a lot of times people think

887
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:15,369
creating companies is going to be fun.

888
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:17,869
I would say it's not. It's really not that fun

889
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:19,612
There are periods of fun

890
00:40:19,612 --> 00:40:23,289
and there are periods of where it's just awful.

891
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:26,459
Particularly if you're the CEO of the company

892
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:29,000
you actually have a distillation of all the worst problems

893
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,349
in the company

894
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:34,619
There is no point in spending time on things that are going right.

895
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:38,188
So you only spend your time on things that are going wrong.

896
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:39,839
And the things that are going wrong that

897
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,502
other people can't take care of... you're like the worst

898
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:46,889
You have a filter for the crappiest problems from the company

899
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:51,369
the most pernicious and painful problem.

900
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:57,916
So I wouldn't say .. I think you have to feel quite compelled to do it

901
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:00,529
and have a fairly high pain threshold and as a friend of mine

902
00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:02,699
who says like starting companies is like

903
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:06,939
staring into the abyss and eating glass.

904
00:41:06,939 --> 00:41:10,749
There is some truth to that.

905
00:41:10,749 --> 00:41:15,749
The staring into the abyss part is that you're gonna be constantly facing

906
00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:17,279
the extermination of the company

907
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:19,619
because most startups fail.

908
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:23,815
90% or 99% of startups fail.

909
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,589
So ...

910
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:29,909
That's the staring into the abyss part because you constantly say

911
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:34,879
if I don't get this right, the company will die.

912
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:36,935
Should be quite stressful

913
00:41:36,935 --> 00:41:41,379
And then the eating glass part is

914
00:41:41,379 --> 00:41:42,899
You've got you've got to do

915
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:44,541
You got to do the problems....

916
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,651
You got to work on the problems of the company needs to work on

917
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:49,366
not the problems you want to work on

918
00:41:49,366 --> 00:41:52,539
So you end up working on problems

919
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:55,709
that you really wish you weren't working on

920
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:59,129
So, that's the eating glass part.

921
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:00,609
And that goes on for a long time

922
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:03,825
QUESTION: So how do you keep your focus on the big picture

923
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:05,643
when you constantly face with

924
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:09,946
you could be out of business in a month?

925
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:15,017
Well it's just a very small percentage of mental energy is on the big picture,

926
00:42:15,017 --> 00:42:18,739
like you know where you are generally heading for

927
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:24,265
And the actual path is going to be some sort of zigzagy thing in that direction

928
00:42:24,265 --> 00:42:29,081
You try not to deviate too far from the path that you want to be on,

929
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:33,159
but you're gonna have to do that to some degree

930
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,208
But I don't want to diminish, I mean

931
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:38,180
I think the profit motive is a good one

932
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,979
if the rules of an industry are properly set up

933
00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:42,679
So there is nothing fundamentally wrong with profit.

934
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:46,229
Profit just means that people are paying you more

935
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:48,069
for whatever you're doing

936
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:51,019
than you're spending to create it.

937
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:52,439
That's a good thing.

938
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:55,529
If that's not the case

939
00:42:55,529 --> 00:42:59,199
then you'll be out of business and rightfully so

940
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,549
Sure you're not adding enough value

941
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:04,149
But now there are cases of course

942
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:06,602
where people will do bad things

943
00:43:06,602 --> 00:43:09,267
in order to achieve profit.

944
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:13,159
But that's actually quite unusual

945
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,389
because usually the rules are set up

946
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:20,569
mostly correctly like not completely, but mostly correctly.

947
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:23,674
SAL: Well we have time for one more question. Joe?

948
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,509
QUESTION: I have an important one... SAL: ok very good yes

949
00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:29,602
QUESTION: So a few months ago you teased Hyperloop

950
00:43:29,602 --> 00:43:32,536
and we haven't heard anything since.

951
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:35,132
So first of all, a few of us engineers are talking about

952
00:43:35,132 --> 00:43:37,818
and I think we have a few ideas if you need help.

953
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:40,869
But if you feel comfortable

954
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,587
maybe you could tell us a little bit more.

955
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,805
ELON: I was reading about the California high-speed rail.

956
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:49,014
It was quite depressing

957
00:43:49,014 --> 00:43:53,853
because California taxpayers

958
00:43:53,853 --> 00:43:58,076
are going to be on the hook to build

959
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:02,299
the most expensive high-speed rail per mile in the world –

960
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:03,857
and the slowest.

961
00:44:03,857 --> 00:44:08,525
Those are not the superlatives you want.

962
00:44:08,525 --> 00:44:11,897
And it's like: Damn, like we're in California we make super high-tech stuff

963
00:44:11,897 --> 00:44:16,699
Why are we gonna be spending 100 billion dollars

964
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:20,287
for something that will take two hours

965
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:23,030
to go from LA to San Francisco

966
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,579
Like okay why can't I get a plane to do that in 45 minutes

967
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:28,429
It doesn't make much sense.

968
00:44:28,429 --> 00:44:32,623
Isn't there some better way to do it than that?

969
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:39,249
So if you just say ok, well, what would you ideally want

970
00:44:39,249 --> 00:44:42,013
in a transportation system you take?

971
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:46,136
Well, you'd want something that –

972
00:44:46,136 --> 00:44:48,546
relative to existing modes of transportation –

973
00:44:48,546 --> 00:44:52,510
is faster, twice as fast, costs half as much per ticket

974
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,406
can't crash –

975
00:44:54,406 --> 00:44:56,649
is immune to weather –

976
00:44:57,399 --> 00:44:59,232
You can make the whole thing like self powered --

977
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:01,024
with solar panels, or something like that.

978
00:45:01,024 --> 00:45:04,949
That would be great...a good outcome.

979
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:08,039
And so what would do that

980
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,139
and what's the fastest way,

981
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:12,869
short of inventing teleportation that you could do something like that.

982
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:16,139
Some of the limits to that solution are fairly obvious

983
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:19,499
and some are not so obvious.

984
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:21,259
And then the details...

985
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:24,999
the devil's in the details of actually making something like that work.

986
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:30,365
But I came into conclusion that there is something like that could work

987
00:45:30,365 --> 00:45:32,889
and would be practical.

988
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:36,169
SAL: Is this around the vacuated tubes?

989
00:45:36,169 --> 00:45:38,529
The vacuum tubes well the old bank....

990
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:41,608
ELON: It's something like that

991
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:44,989
SAL: We haven't been more public with what this is?

992
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:47,823
ELON: No. Although I did say that once Tesla was profitable,

993
00:45:47,823 --> 00:45:51,159
that I would talk more about it.

994
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:54,079
But we haven't done our earning's call yet.

995
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:59,250
So I think I'll probably do it after the earning's call... SAL: yeah

996
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,746
ELON: The thing is,

997
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:03,006
I’m kind of strung out on the things that I am doing.

998
00:46:03,006 --> 00:46:04,123
So adding another thing –

999
00:46:04,123 --> 00:46:06,129
SAL: Yeah.

1000
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:06,995
ELON: It's like -- It doesn't --

1001
00:46:06,995 --> 00:46:07,799
You know, that’s a lot.

1002
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:09,338
SAL: Learning the guitar.

1003
00:46:09,338 --> 00:46:11,061
You could pick up all sorts of things.

1004
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:13,470
ELON: Right. I tried learning the violin.

1005
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,665
That’s, by the way, a hard thing to learn. LAUGHS.

1006
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:19,442
SAL: Yes. Launching rockets – electric cars,

1007
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:19,880
ELON: Yeah.

1008
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,750
SAL: revolutionizing transportation. Yeah. That’s easy.

1009
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,602
ELON: I cannot play the violin at all.

1010
00:46:23,602 --> 00:46:26,364
I'm very horrible.

1011
00:46:26,394 --> 00:46:27,604
If you think about the future,

1012
00:46:27,604 --> 00:46:29,626
you want a future that’s better than the past.

1013
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:32,350
And so if we had something like the Hyperloop,

1014
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:33,700
I think that would be, like, “Cool!”

1015
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,461
You’d look forward to the day that was working.

1016
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,791
And if something like that –

1017
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:41,912
even if it were only in one place –

1018
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:46,162
from LA to San Francisco, or New York to DC,

1019
00:46:46,162 --> 00:46:47,490
or something like that –

1020
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,155
Then it would be cool enough

1021
00:46:50,155 --> 00:46:51,454
that it would be like a tourist attraction.

1022
00:46:51,454 --> 00:46:51,992
SAL: Yeah.

1023
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:53,831
ELON: It would be like a ride or something.

1024
00:46:53,831 --> 00:46:57,411
So even if some of the initial assumptions didn’t work out –

1025
00:46:57,411 --> 00:47:00,709
the economics didn’t work out quite as one expected –

1026
00:47:00,709 --> 00:47:02,516
it would be cool enough that [people would say]

1027
00:47:02,516 --> 00:47:04,878
“I want to journey to that place just to ride on that thing.”

1028
00:47:04,878 --> 00:47:06,465
That would be pretty cool.

1029
00:47:06,465 --> 00:47:07,329
SAL: Wow.

1030
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:09,905
ELON: And, so that’s, I think, how,

1031
00:47:09,905 --> 00:47:11,451
If you come up with a new technology,

1032
00:47:11,451 --> 00:47:12,569
it should feel like that.

1033
00:47:12,569 --> 00:47:13,991
You should really –

1034
00:47:13,991 --> 00:47:15,604
If you told it to an objective person,

1035
00:47:15,604 --> 00:47:16,500
would they look forward to the day

1036
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,339
that thing became available?

1037
00:47:19,354 --> 00:47:22,395
It’d be pretty exciting to do something like that.

1038
00:47:22,395 --> 00:47:23,773
Or an aircraft.

1039
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:25,077
like, I thought it was really disappointing

1040
00:47:25,077 --> 00:47:26,909
when the Concord was taken out of commission,

1041
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:29,492
and there was no supersonic transport available.

1042
00:47:29,492 --> 00:47:30,964
SAL: Yeah.

1043
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,791
ELON: And of course, the 787 has had some issues.

1044
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:35,853
SAL: Yeah.

1045
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,253
ELON: So. But the thing is, the 787,

1046
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:40,586
even in the best case scenario,

1047
00:47:40,586 --> 00:47:42,668
is only a slightly better version of the triple seven (777).

1048
00:47:42,668 --> 00:47:44,041
SAL: Yeah.

1049
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:47,086
ELON: And it’s like, OK. It’s not that exciting.

1050
00:47:47,086 --> 00:47:50,566
SAL: So this is something that you are working on.

1051
00:47:50,566 --> 00:47:52,127
ELON: I wouldn’t say “working on.”

1052
00:47:52,127 --> 00:47:53,664
SAL: And one day, in the not-too-far-[off] future --

1053
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:55,913
or there are some plans or consultants involved or something.

1054
00:47:55,932 --> 00:47:57,489
ELON: LAUGHS.

1055
00:47:57,489 --> 00:47:59,992
SAL: You’ve made some phone calls to Russia?

1056
00:47:59,992 --> 00:48:03,746
ELON: Every now and then, it's sort of percolating away.

1057
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:06,083
I’m not actively thinking about it.

1058
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,940
But then there is some new element of that –

1059
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,372
I’ll think, “Oh well, you know, this would make it better.”

1060
00:48:09,372 --> 00:48:10,289
SAL: Fascinating.

1061
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:12,998
SAL: No. Well, thanks.

1062
00:48:12,998 --> 00:48:15,063
I think I’m speaking for everyone [when I say]

1063
00:48:15,063 --> 00:48:17,880
This is like the most epic possible conversation

1064
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,301
one could have over about the course of an hour.

1065
00:48:20,301 --> 00:48:22,393
And I think all of us would love to chat with you

1066
00:48:22,393 --> 00:48:23,559
for hours on end.

1067
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:24,538
But thank you so much.

1068
00:48:24,538 --> 00:48:26,012
I mean, I know you have a lot of free time,

1069
00:48:26,012 --> 00:48:27,303
and so, it probably wasn’t that big of a deal

1070
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:28,447
for you to come here.

1071
00:48:28,463 --> 00:48:28,833
ELON: Yeah.

1072
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:30,710
SAL: But yeah, it was a huge honor.

1073
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,136
And I think that it inspired all of us to go out

1074
00:48:32,136 --> 00:48:34,236
and change the world and the universe.

1075
00:48:34,236 --> 00:48:34,898
ELON: Cool. All right.

1076
00:48:34,898 --> 00:48:39,375
SAL: Thank you very much.
