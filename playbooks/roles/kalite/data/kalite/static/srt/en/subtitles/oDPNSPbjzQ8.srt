1
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:07,502
We're in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine

2
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:10,269
in a chapel within the church

3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:12,472
which is called the Brancacci chapel.

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:17,002
it is completely filled with fresco and also tempa painting

5
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:22,705
and on the left in the upper register,
is a painting by Masaccio

6
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:26,002
It's actually two paintings.
One is the "Expulsion from Eden"

7
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:29,370
and to its right, is a much larger painting,
"The Tribute Money"

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:35,772
And the chapel is filled with people here
to see Masaccio's great masterpeice.

9
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:40,669
Masaccio painted a few of the scenes here
of the life of Saint Peter,

10
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:45,604
but the rest of the chapel was largely
painted by one of his contemporaries, Masculino.

11
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:48,334
But it's Masaccio that we are here to see.

12
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:50,871
So let's talk about the "Tribute Money" first

13
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:55,822
It's a pretty complicated scene. It's a story from the
New Testament that tells of Christ

14
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,470
being confronted by a tax collector who works for Rome.

15
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,178
The problem is Christ has renounced
all worldly possessions;

16
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:03,780
he doesn't have any money to pay.

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,969
Right, Christ and the apostles have no money to pay the tax collector who we see here in the center

18
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,111
in orange with his back to us.

19
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:14,501
And with a short skirt, unlike the
other figures which are more fully clothed.

20
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:18,871
And Christ and the apostles have helos,
and we can identify the tax collector

21
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,505
because he doesn't have a halo.

22
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:23,038
And he's making gestures demanding money.

23
00:01:23,038 --> 00:01:26,915
The tax collector is standing in the lovely contrapposto.

24
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:31,105
And some art historians have suggested that they may have been painted from a Roman sculpture.

25
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:34,838
The contrapposto could have also
have come from Donatello.

26
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:35,704
Absolutely.

27
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:41,771
Christ directs Saint Peter to go get money
to pay the tax collector from the Sea of Galilee,

28
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:46,500
from the mouth of a fish. So Christ performs a miracle, the apostles will indeed be able to pay

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,270
the tax collector because the money
will appear in the mouth of a fish,

30
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,970
that we see Saint Peter getting on the far left,

31
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,203
and then on the far right,
we see Saint Peter paying the tax collector.

32
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:59,891
So we have three difference moments of time.

33
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:02,516
In the New Testament, Christ says:

34
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:05,504
"Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's,
render unto God what is God's."

35
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:09,337
In a sense saying, Caesar minted this money - 
we can give it back to him -

36
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,803
it's not important. What's important is the soul.

37
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:15,998
There's a really specific Florentine context for this.

38
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:19,747
The Florentine government had just initiated a new tax

39
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:23,470
called the 'Catasto' which was an income tax.

40
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,704
I think this was seen by the Florentines as an idea

41
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:30,840
that Christ was condoning that kind if civic responsibility.

42
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,869
I'm really interested in how complicated that story is,

43
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:36,437
and yet how clearly Masaccio was able to convey it.

44
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:39,970
Our eye goes not to the left of the scene first,

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,837
which presumably would be where we would start -
we read from left to right.

46
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:46,570
But instead goes to Christ in the center.

47
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,671
All of the apostles attention and the tax collector's attention

48
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,080
is on Christ. And so our eyes go to Christ as well.

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,578
Christ points to Peter who in turn points, almost incredulously, to the Sea of Galilee

50
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:03,472
Right, you want me to go to get the money from where?

51
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:05,505
And that of course moves our eye left,

52
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:07,708
over to where we see Peter again.

53
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:11,204
We can recognize it's Peter,
even though his face is so foreshortened.

54
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:15,569
He has taken off the red garb, presumably
not to get it dirty or wet as he kneels.

55
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:19,161
You can see him just opening up the
mouth of the fish.

56
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,495
I love it. It's so literal.

57
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:21,745
It's very sweet.

58
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:23,728
Masaccio is also separating
that scene on the left,

59
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:25,537
so we read it as a separate scene.

60
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:28,745
Because he has put Saint Peter
way into the background.

61
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:30,204
And there really is a background.

62
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:33,743
And it's been accomplished in a
number of different ways.

63
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:36,727
This is lovely atmospheric perspective that allows

64
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:39,273
us to move back from mountain to mountain

65
00:03:39,273 --> 00:03:40,912
as the sky gets lighter.

66
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:43,535
Masaccio has created a deep illusion of space here.

67
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:47,771
So the figures are really in a very believable landscape.

68
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,773
Not only the atmospheric perspective,

69
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:52,766
but linear perspective is employed on the right.

70
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:57,242
We can see the orthogonals in the rather
classical looking building on the right.

71
00:03:57,242 --> 00:04:00,242
In fact, sometimes I've suspected the only reason

72
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:02,408
that there's a building in this painting at all,

73
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,671
is because Masaccio is so interested in linear perspective.

74
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:10,408
This is one of the first surviving examples of employment of linear perspective in a painting.

75
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:13,810
And we have the "Holy Trinity" just a year or so earlier.

76
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,604
Christ's head is the vanishing point
in his use of linear perspective

77
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:20,574
so not only is all of the attention
paid to Christ by his apostles,

78
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:23,970
but the very structure of the painting brings our eye there.

79
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,207
So you look as Christ - he looks very calm.

80
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:28,871
You follow his gesture over to Saint Peter

81
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:33,171
and Saint Peter looking agitated and annoyed.

82
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:35,036
He does look grumpy, doesn't he?

83
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:36,804
And in disbelief.

84
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:42,005
And then you see this circular gathering
of the apostels around them and

85
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:44,490
you start to register their reactions.

86
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,149
Some of them looking
"Oh, what's going to happen next?"

87
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,035
Apprehensive.

88
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:50,204
Some of them looking a little bit more calm.

89
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:55,857
But in all of that, Christ remains central
and calm in this moment

90
00:04:55,857 --> 00:04:57,586
when he performs a miracle.

91
00:04:57,586 --> 00:04:59,537
It really is a kind of conversation.

92
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:01,729
It's all this gesturing to tell the story.

93
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,437
Really activating the story. Absolutely.

94
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:06,883
I really love also, the contrast between certain apostles.

95
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:08,643
For instance, you're absolutely right.

96
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:11,205
Peter looks like he's angry.

97
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:13,241
And is not sure if he is not sure if he should actually

98
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,037
be protecting Christ from the tax collector or not.

99
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:19,323
Whereas John, next to him with blonde hair,
is such a passive face.

100
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:20,705
Very calm.

101
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:23,237
So calm. I can't help but think Masaccio put

102
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:25,072
those faces together in order to achieve

103
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:26,590
the greatest contrast.

104
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,013
I think there is no question.

105
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:31,902
I mean Masaccio is thinking about every possible way

106
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:34,454
he can make this image seem real.

107
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:37,822
And I think that the space, to a 15th century viewer,

108
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:39,604
looked incredibly realistic.

109
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:42,370
The use of light and shadow really
picking up on Giotto's achievement

110
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,070
of the previous century.
And pushing it forward dramatically.

111
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,386
To me, the element that adds the
greatest realism are those cast shadows on the ground.

112
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:51,635
Yes, they're amazing.

113
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:53,855
They're so believable. I mean you really get a sense of

114
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:57,884
of these figures standing in a landscape.
The light hitting them from the right,

115
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:01,904
which is by the way, the same direction
as the real light in the chapel.

116
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,737
There's a window over to the right.

117
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:05,087
Just over the alter.

118
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:08,037
If you follow those shadows back,
if you look down at the ground,

119
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:10,703
they give you an alternation of light and dark

120
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,980
that helps establish a foreground and background.

121
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,063
I have to say I'm really taken with
the representation of the feet.

122
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:20,755
We talked about the sense of mass
and volume in the figures.

123
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,106
All of these figures seem so planted.

124
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:24,829
Oh, I love their feet.

125
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:27,381
There're so grounded. If you, look for example

126
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,571
at the left of the tax collector, you'll see

127
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,903
that the left side of his ankle is in shadow, but the front

128
00:06:32,903 --> 00:06:36,239
part of his left foot is in the sunlight.

129
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:40,521
So, Masaccio is paying such careful
attention to light and shadow.

130
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:44,638
And look at those foreshortened halos
that Masaccio puts in place

131
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,817
so that they're not those flat gold circles that...

132
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:50,674
Well, they're foreshortened, just like
Peter's face on the left of the painting.

133
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:52,957
Right, except a halo isn't a real thing.

134
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:57,184
So in a sense, taking this symbol of spirituality and

135
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,277
treating it as if it were a solid in the world.

136
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:05,307
It is this funny moment in the 15th century when the symbolic traditions of representation

137
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:09,069
that have been handed down from the Medieval,
are coming into contact

138
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:13,669
with a kind of naturalistic facility,
and an interest in naturalism.

139
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:16,603
And so you get these very funny relationships.

140
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,351
So Masaccio really is giving us a masterpiece of

141
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:24,837
illusionism, of the illusion of space,
of the illusion of volume.

142
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:27,537
To me, the figures are just fully
human in the way

143
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:30,471
I think about Donatello's figures or,
and San Michele.

144
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:33,352
They have psychological depth.

145
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,970
What is it about Florentine culture that is allowing

146
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,870
for this kind of fully human expression?

147
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,297
And this is one of the great centers of humanism,
that's looking back to classicism

148
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,537
and certainly we see that in a number of direct ways.

149
00:07:45,537 --> 00:07:49,137
But more than that,
it's this ennobling of the human experience

150
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:55,504
that I think is so central to the
license that Masaccio was taking here.
