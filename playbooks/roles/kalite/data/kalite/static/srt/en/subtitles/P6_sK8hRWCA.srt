1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:03,590
Let say that you started off with three apples

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:09,173
and then I were to give you another seven apples.

3
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:10,771
So my question to you,

4
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,502
and this might be very obvious

5
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:17,718
is how many apples do you now have?

6
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:21,432
and l'll give you a second to think about that

7
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,448
Well, this is fairly basic:

8
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:24,508
you add 3 apples,

9
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:25,764
now I'm going to give you 7 more

10
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:27,284
you now have 3 plus 7

11
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:29,389
you now have 10 apples.

12
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:32,479
But let say I wanna do the same type of thinking

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,570
but I'm too lazy to write the word apples

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,285
Let say that instead of writing the word "apples",

15
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:39,340
I just use the letter "a".

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,855
and I say... let say...

17
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,370
and this is, say, a different scenario...

18
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,870
you start off with 4 apples

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,063
and to that I add another 2 apples.

20
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:53,507
How many apples do you now have?

21
00:00:53,507 --> 00:00:54,664
And instead of writing "apples",

22
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:56,438
I'm just going to write "a's" here.

23
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:59,036
So, how many of these "a's" do you now have?

24
00:00:59,036 --> 00:00:59,815
And once again,

25
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:04,309
I'll to give you a few seconds to think about that.

26
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:06,723
Well, this also might be a little bit of common sense for you

27
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:08,916
if you had four of these apples,

28
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,820
whatever these a's represented,

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,933
if you have 4 of them and then you add 2 more of them

30
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:15,800
you're now going to have 6 of these apples.

31
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,261
But once again,

32
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,923
we started off assuming that "a's" represent apples

33
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:21,704
but they could have represented anything

34
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:24,602
If you have 4 of whatever "a" represents

35
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:27,220
and then you have another 2 of whatever "a" represents,

36
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,839
you'll now have 6 of whatever "a" represents.

37
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,763
Or if you just think of it as if I have 4 "a's"

38
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:33,033
and then I add another 2 "a's",

39
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,303
I'm going to have 6 "a's".

40
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:40,410
You can think of 4 "a's" as a + a + a + a.

41
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,577
And if to that I add another 2 "a's".

42
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:46,779
So + a + a. That's 2 "a's" right over there.

43
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,902
How many a's do I now have?

44
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:51,971
Well that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

45
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:55,385
I now have 6 "a's".

46
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:59,236
So thinking of it that way, let's get a little bit more abstract.

47
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:04,175
Let say that I have 5 "x's", whatever "x" represents.

48
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:06,176
"x" could be some number...

49
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,715
So I have 5 of whatever that number is

50
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:14,123
and from that I subtract 2 of whatever that number is.

51
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:16,303
What would this evaluate to?

52
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:21,829
How many of these "x's" will I now have.

53
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:27,403
So it's essentially "5x - 2x" is going to be what times "x".

54
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:32,581
And once again, I'll give you a few seconds to think about it.

55
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:34,178
Well, if I have 5 of something

56
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:35,776
and I subtract 2 of those away,

57
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:38,879
I'm going to have 3 of that something left.

58
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,109
So this is going to be equal to 3x.

59
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:44,756
5x - 2x is equal to 3x.

60
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,703
And if you really think about what that means.

61
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:51,942
5 "x's" are just: x + x + x + x + x.

62
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:54,969
And then we're going to take away 2 of those "x's".

63
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,783
We're going to take away 2 "x's".

64
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:59,153
So take away one "x", take away 2 "x's".

65
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:03,153
You are left... you are going to be left with 3 "x's".
