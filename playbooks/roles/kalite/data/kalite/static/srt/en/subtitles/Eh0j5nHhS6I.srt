1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,950
Problem number 18.

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,580
The average arithmetic mean of x and y is k.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,040
So the average, so x plus y/2 is k, right?

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,630
That's the average of x and y is equal to k.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,230
Which of the following is the average of x, y and z?

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,790
So they want to know what x plus y--

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,220
so the average of x, y, and z is,

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,980
you add up all the numbers and you divide by 3.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,440
They want to know in terms of k and z.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,830
So if we could substitute for x plus y, then we'd be done.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,280
So multiplying this equation by 2,

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,790
we get x plus y is equal to 2k, right?

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,460
Just multiply both sides by 2.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,870
And then x plus y is 2k.

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,650
So let's just substitute 2k here for x plus y.

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,460
So then you just get 2k plus z/3.

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,990
That's the average of x, y and z: 2k plus ,

18
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:07,410
and that is choice,2k plus z/3,and that is choice A.

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,960
Problem 19.

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,150
We have a neat drawing here.

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,930
Let me see if I can draw this.

22
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,680
Let's see, we have a circle,

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,320
and then we have a triangle inside of that.

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,350
Well it's not really inside of it,it kind of

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,550
does something like-- let's see,the triangle goes like that.

26
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,870
And the other line kind of goes-- Oh, oh, close enough.

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,600
Close enough.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,990
I think you get the point.

29
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,520
It actually kind of touches at the bottom there.

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,470
This should be touching at the bottom.

31
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,770
And then we have-- oh,

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,340
we have another line that goes down like this.

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,030
All right. OK.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:12,180
This is O, Y, X, W, Z. This is W.

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,560
We can do a better color on W, OK?

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,740
That's O, V, all right.

37
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,510
In the figure above, triangle X, Y, Z is equilateral--

38
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,290
that's good to know-- with side of length 2.

39
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,880
So this side is 2, this side is 2, and this whole side is 2.

40
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,920
If w, y is the diameter of the circle with center O--

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,660
so w, y, this is the diameter of the circle with center O--

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,550
then the area of the circle is-- fascinating.

43
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,210
So essentially, we just need to figure out

44
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,000
what the height of this line is,

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,730
because if we know the length of this

46
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,790
we can figure out the area.

47
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,260
Because that's the diameter,we'd know the radius,

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,320
and we'd use pi r squared.

49
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,700
So how do we figure that out?

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,170
This is an equilateral triangle,

51
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,590
and so that means all of the angles are 60 degrees.

52
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,040
So that's 60, this is 60 degrees.

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,800
And now this whole angle up here is going to be 60,

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,030
but we split it exactly in two, right?

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,240
So this angle is going to be 30 degrees

56
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,870
and this angle is 30 degrees.

57
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,730
And if you don't believe me,how else do we know that?

58
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,740
Well they tell us that this is a right angle, right?

59
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,590
This is a right angle, this is a 90 degree angle.

60
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,520
So that's how we know this was actually split in two,

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
because this is 90, this is 60,

62
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,760
and they have to add up to 180. So this angle up here is 30.

63
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,280
So I think you are going to see now that

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,400
this is a classic 30, 60, 90 triangle, right?

65
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,540
If this side up here is 2,

66
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,340
then we know that the side opposite the 30 degree side

67
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,210
is 1/2 the hypotenuse.

68
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,920
This side is the hypotenuse right here.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,880
The corresponding side to the 30 degree side,

70
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,950
or the opposite to the 30 degree side,is 1/2 the hypotenuse.

71
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,080
So this is 2, this is 1.

72
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,500
And that also makes sense,

73
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,800
because this is a symmetric triangle,

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,210
and this w is the midpoint,

75
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,240
because it's perpendicular and these angles the same.

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,120
So this would also be 1.

77
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,700
So 1, and 1, and 2,1 plus 1 is 2.

78
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,060
So that makes sense as well.

79
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,560
And then we know-- and if you forget this,

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,940
they actually give you the formula

81
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,310
at the beginning of every SAT exam--

82
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,400
that the side opposite the 60 degree side--

83
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,090
which is the side we're trying to figure out--

84
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,020
that square root of 3 times this side--

85
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,660
so square root of 3 times this is what?

86
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,810
Well it's square root of 3 times 1, which is square root of 3.

87
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,460
And if you don't believe this,

88
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,320
you could try the Pythagorean theorem, right?

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,380
Square root of 3 squared plus 1 squared is equal to--

90
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,770
well 3 plus 1, which is equal to 4,

91
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,250
which is equal to 2 squared.

92
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,440
Which is equal to hypotenuse squared.

93
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,850
So we figured out this diameter right here

94
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,780
is square root of 3.

95
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,730
The whole thing is square root of 3.

96
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,790
If the whole thing is square root of 3, what is the radius?

97
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,510
The radius is going to be 1/2 of that.

98
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,690
The radius is 1/2 of that,

99
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,500
so the radius is square root of 3/2.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,670
And now we're ready to figure out the area.

101
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,840
Area is equal to pi r squared.

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,730
And they give you this formula too

103
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,660
at the beginning of the SAT.

104
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,860
So area is equal to pi times the square root of 3/2 squared.

105
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,560
And that equals pi times square root of 3 squared is 3/--

106
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,120
and then 2 squared is 4, so 3/4 pi.

107
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,790
And 3/4 pi is choice C.

108
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,040
Image, clear image, invert colors, all right.

109
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,180
Problem 20.

110
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,120
We're already at the end of this section.

111
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,170
Problem 20, when 15 is divided by the positive integer k,

112
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,080
the remainder 3.

113
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:54,730
So 15 divided by k has a remainder of 3. I'm lazy.

114
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,590
How many different values of k is this true?

115
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:06,700
So when 15 is divided by k,you have a remainder of 3.

116
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,890
Interesting, OK.

117
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:16,920
Actually the easiest thing to do is say well,

118
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:23,490
15 divided by k is going to be, essentially--

119
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,080
Well the easiest way--

120
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,070
I'm just trying to think of

121
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,620
whether we should just do it by brute force.

122
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,660
We can actually just do it by brute force,

123
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,010
because it says k is a positive integer, right?

124
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,140
So what values of k work? Well does k equal 1 work?

125
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,550
When 15 is divided by 1,there's no remainder.

126
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,540
So k 1 does not work.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,510
k equals 2?

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,130
Actually, let's just do it.

129
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:52,690
k remainder 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, right?

130
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,880
It's going to go all the way up to 15.

131
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,120
You know, we could keep trying.

132
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,280
So when 1, the remainder is 0.

133
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,100
2 goes into 15 7 times with a remainder of 1.

134
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,220
3 goes into 15 with a remainder of 0.

135
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,790
4 goes into 15 with a remainder of 3, right?

136
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,070
Because 4 gets to 12, and then you have a remainder of 3.

137
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,440
5 has a remainder of 0.

138
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,620
6, once again, 6 gets to 12,and then it has a remainder of 3.

139
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,870
So 6 works. So 4 and 6 work.

140
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,440
7 has a remainder of 1, right?

141
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,850
7, 14 remainder of 1.

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,140
And then if you just did

143
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:45,410
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 8 has a remainder of 7.

144
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,850
9 has a remainder of 6. 10 has a remainder of 5.

145
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,540
11 has a remainder of 4, right?

146
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,560
15 divided by 11 is 1, remainder of 4.

147
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,200
12 has a remainder of 3, so 12 works.

148
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,530
13 has a remainder of 2. 14 has a remainder of 1.

149
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,240
And then 15 has no remainder again.

150
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,060
So the numbers that work for k are 12, 6, and 4.

151
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,790
So it was essentially the factors of--

152
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,990
well, all right, I can't actually say that.

153
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,510
Well, we just did it by brute force

154
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,340
and those are the 3 k's that work for this problem.

155
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,140
So the answer is choice C.

156
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,590
I'm trying to think if there's a faster,

157
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,430
elegant way of doing this.

158
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,170
But this actually didn't take too much time.

159
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,410
But anyway, that's all for this section.

160
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,270
I'll see you in the next SAT section.
