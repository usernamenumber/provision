1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
   

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,660
I've gotten several requests
to explain or teach the

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,590
mean value theorem.

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,010
So let's do that in this video.

5
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,440
So this is the mean
value theorem.

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,540
   

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,530
And I have mixed feelings
about the mean value theorem.

8
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,490
It's kind of neat, but what
you'll see is, it might not be

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,820
obvious to prove, but the
intuition behind it's

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,860
pretty obvious.

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,010
And the reason I have mixed
feelings about it, is that even

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:34,130
though, as you'll hopefully
see, the intuition is pretty

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,770
obvious, but they stick it in
the math books, and people are

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,890
just trying to learn calculus,
and get to what matters, and

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,710
then they put the mean value
theorem in there, and they have

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,700
all of this function notation,
and they have all of these

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,570
words, and it just
confuses people.

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,890
So hopefully this video will
clarify that little bit,

19
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,360
and I'm curious to see
what you think of it.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:51,880
So let's see.

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,820
What does the mean
value theorem say?

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,890
Let me draw some axes.

23
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,505
I'll do a visual
explanation first.

24
00:00:56,505 --> 00:01:01,340
   

25
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,340
I think this calls for magenta.

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,370
So that's my x-axis.

27
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,050
   

28
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,340
This is my y-axis.

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,000
And let's say I have
some function f of x.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,110
   

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,040
So let me draw my f of x.

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,100
That's as good as any.

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,950
And this is some function f
of x, and I'm going to put

34
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,750
a few conditions on f of x.

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:38,620
f of x has to be continuous
and differentiable.

36
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,380
And I know a lot of you
probably get intimidated

37
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,270
when you hear these words.

38
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,830
It sounds like what a
mathematician would say, and

39
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,420
it sounds very abstract.

40
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,940
All continuous means is that
the curve is connected to

41
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,280
itself as you go along it.

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,300
And here, the conditions are
over a closed interval.

43
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,810
This is another very
mathy term you'll see.

44
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,490
So you'll often say, on a
closed interval from a to b.

45
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,750
All that means is an interval,
let's say a is the low point,

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,510
let's say this is a, we don't
know what number that is.

47
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,155
That could be minus
5, or who knows.

48
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:17,020
And let's say this is b, right
here, let me b right here.

49
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,080
Let's say that's be.

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,720
So when people talk about a
closed interval, defined on a

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,360
closed interval, that means
that the function needs to be

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,460
defined at every number between
a and b, and the function needs

53
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,250
to be defined at a and at b.

54
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,930
If they said over an open
interval between a and b, that

55
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,180
means that it's only defined at
every value between a and b,

56
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,160
but not necessarily at a and b.

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,030
So it has to be continuous,
differentiable, and let's say

58
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,790
it's defined over the closed
interval, and this is just

59
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,480
the notation for it, a b.

60
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,660
So that means, it has to be
defined at all of the x values

61
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,250
from a to b, including a and b.

62
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,660
If it was an open interval,
you would write it like this.

63
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,720
You'd write a and b.

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,350
That means an interval for all
the numbers between a and

65
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,060
b, but not including those.

66
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,580
So let's ignore that for now.

67
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,400
So back to the mean
value theorem.

68
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,060
So you know, hopefully,
what continuous means.

69
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,350
Let me draw here a function
that's not continuous.

70
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,620
So a function that is
not continuous would

71
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,590
look like this.

72
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,320
It would go like this,
and it would start up

73
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,180
here, go like that.

74
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,490
Right?

75
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,430
So this would be an example
of a function, let's say,

76
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,581
same axes, let me draw
it in a different color.

77
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:35,560
If that was our y-- no,
that's not a good.

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,440
If that was our y-axis, and
that was our x-axis, just to

79
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,800
give you the reference
for what I drew.

80
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,470
So if the function is
continuous, continuous,

81
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,560
continuous, and then it jumps,
that disconnect, that

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,240
would make this function
discontinuous, or it would not

83
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,720
be a continuous function.

84
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,670
So a function just has
to be continuous.

85
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,770
And now what does
differentiable mean?

86
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,950
Differentiable means that at
every point over the interval

87
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,940
that we care about, you have to
be able to find the derivative.

88
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,610
That means you can take
the derivative of it.

89
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,030
It's a differentiable.

90
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,050
And what else does that mean?

91
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,150
Well, that means that if you
were to graph the derivative

92
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,460
of this function, that
it is also continuous.

93
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,240
And I'll let you think
about that for a second.

94
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,905
And actually, in this video I'm
going to show you an example of

95
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:22,700
a function that is continuous,
but not differentiable and

96
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,020
because of that, the mean
value theorem breaks down.

97
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,900
But anyway, let's get back
to the mean value theorem.

98
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,120
Most of the functions we
deal with satisfy all

99
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,210
three of these things.

100
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,290
Unless, you know, you're doing
limit problems, and they try to

101
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,960
make these things break down.

102
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,990
Anyway, back to the function.

103
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,560
So this function meets all
of these requirements.

104
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,830
So all it says is, if I were
take the average slope

105
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,120
between point a and point b.

106
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,800
So what is the slope, the
average slope between

107
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,450
point a and point b?

108
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,060
Well, slope is just
rise over run, right?

109
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,610
So what is it?

110
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,810
Let me see if I can draw
the average slope.

111
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,700
So the run would
be this distance.

112
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,565
That'd be the run, right,
and this would be the rise.

113
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:10,400
   

114
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,630
So this is the point,
right here, that's

115
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,270
the point a, f of a.

116
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,450
Over here, this is
the point b, f of b.

117
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,270
So what's the average
slope between a and b?

118
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,240
Well, it's rise over run.

119
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,190
So what's the rise?

120
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,510
What's this distance?

121
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,630
How much have we gone up
from f of a to f of b?

122
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,100
Well, the rise will
just be f of b, this

123
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,640
height, minus f of a.

124
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,190
f of b minus f of a.

125
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,960
And what's the run,
what's this distance?

126
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,530
Well, it's just b minus a.

127
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,070
   

128
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,430
And if I were to draw a line
that has that average slope, it

129
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,890
would look something like this.

130
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,690
We could make it go through
those two points, but it

131
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,750
really doesn't have to.

132
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,130
Let me do it in a blue.

133
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,570
   

134
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,640
So that's the average
slope between those

135
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,090
two points, right?

136
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,030
So what does the mean
value theorem tell us?

137
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,690
It says, if f of x is defined
over this closed interval from

138
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,960
a to b, and f of x is
continuous, and it's

139
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,750
differentiable, that you could
take the derivative at any

140
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:45,560
point, that there must be some
points c f prime of c is

141
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,350
equal to this thing.

142
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,740
So is equal to f prime of c.

143
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,330
I shouldn't have
written it here.

144
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,820
So what is that telling us?

145
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,140
So all that's telling us,
is if we're continuous,

146
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,000
differentiable, defined over
the closed interval, that

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,890
there's some point c, oh, and c
has to be between a and b,

148
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,550
there's some point between a
and b, and it could be at one

149
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,540
of the points, but there's some
point c where the derivative at

150
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,390
c, or the slope at c, the
instantaneous slope at c, is

151
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,700
exactly equal to the average
slope over that interval.

152
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,090
So what does that mean?

153
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,950
So we can look at it visually.

154
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,790
Is there any point along this
curve where the slope looks

155
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,850
very similar to this average
slope that we calculated?

156
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,030
Well, sure, let's see.

157
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,010
It looks like, maybe,
this point, right here?

158
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,650
Just the way I drew it.

159
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,320
This is very inexact.

160
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,520
But that point looks like the
slope, you know, I could

161
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,060
say the slope is something
like that, right there.

162
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,970
So we don't know what,
analytically, this function is,

163
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,280
but visually, you could see
that at this point c, the

164
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,220
derivative, so I just
picked that point.

165
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,160
So this could be our point c.

166
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,220
And how do we just say that?

167
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,360
Well, because f prime of c is
this slope, and it's equal

168
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,610
to the average slope.

169
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,190
So f prime of c is this thing,
and it's going to be equal to

170
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,460
the average slope over
the whole thing.

171
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,230
And this curve actually
probably has another point

172
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,950
where the slope is equal
to the average slope.

173
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,210
Let's see.

174
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,360
This one looks, like,
right around there.

175
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,710
Just the way I drew it.

176
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,460
Looks like the slope there
could look something like,

177
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,110
could be parallel as well.

178
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,000
These lines should be parallel.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,040
The tangent lines
should be parallel.

180
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,630
So hopefully that makes
a little sense to you.

181
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:41,170
Another way to think about it
is that your average, actually,

182
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,450
let me draw a graph just
to make sure that we

183
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,620
hit the point home.

184
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,870
Let's draw my position
as a function of time.

185
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,630
So this is something,
this'll make it applicable

186
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,000
to the real world.

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,610
So that's my x-axis, or
the time axis, that's

188
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,270
my position axis.

189
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,140
This is going back to our
original intuition of what

190
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,470
even a derivative is.

191
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,720
So this is time, and I call
this position, or distance,

192
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,050
or it doesn't matter.

193
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,490
Position.

194
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,910
And if I was moving at a
constant velocity, my position

195
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,190
as a function of time would
just be a straight line, right?

196
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,050
And the velocity is
actually your slope.

197
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,590
But let's say I had
a varying velocity.

198
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,910
And in reality, if you're
driving a car, you are always

199
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,640
at a variable velocity.

200
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,770
So let's say I start at a
standstill at time t equals 0,

201
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:39,810
and then I accelerate, then I
decelerate a little bit,

202
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,150
decelerate a little bit, I keep
decelerating, and then I come

203
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,860
to a standstill, so my
position stays still.

204
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,920
Then I accelerate
again, decelerate,

205
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,450
accelerate, et cetera.

206
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,080
Right?

207
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,145
So this could be, you know, I
have a variable velocity, and

208
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:59,500
this could be my position
as a function of time.

209
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,390
So all this says, let's
say that after, this

210
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,900
is time 0, position 0.

211
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,920
Let's say after 1 hour, let's
say that is 1 hour, this time

212
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,685
equals 1 hour, let's say
I have gone 60 miles.

213
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:20,660
   

214
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,710
So what can you say?

215
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:29,160
You could say that my average
velocity equals just change in

216
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,370
distance divided by
change in times.

217
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,700
It equals 60 miles per hour.

218
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,230
   

219
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,950
So what the mean values
theorem says, is OK.

220
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,780
Your average velocity, so you
could almost view it as the

221
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,430
average slope between this
point and this point with 60,

222
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,410
if your average velocity was 60
miles per hour, there was some

223
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,950
point in time, maybe more, but
there was at least one point in

224
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,290
time, where you were going
exactly sixty miles per hour.

225
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,590
That make sense, right?

226
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,030
If you average 60 miles per
hour, maybe you're going 40

227
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,880
miles per hour some of the
point, but at some point you

228
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,440
went 80, and in between you had
to be going 60 miles per hour.

229
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,300
So let me see if I can
draw that graphically.

230
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,683
So this slope is my average
velocity, and the way I drew

231
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:17,110
it, there's probably two
points, let's see, probably

232
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,050
right around here, I was
probably going 60 miles per

233
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,380
hour, the slope is probably
60 there, the instantaneous

234
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,100
velocity probably
there, as well.

235
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,710
So before I leave, let's do
this analytically, just

236
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,010
to work with numbers.

237
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,280
And the reason why I have mixed
feelings about the mean value

238
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,040
theorem, it's useful later on,
probably if you become a math

239
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,670
major you'll maybe use it to
prove some theorems, or maybe

240
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,290
you'll prove it, itself.

241
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,390
But if you're just applying
calculus for the most part,

242
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,900
you're not going to be
using the mean value

243
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,610
theorem too much.

244
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,200
But anyway, if you've got to
know it, you've got to know it,

245
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,720
and it tells you something else
about the world, so it's

246
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,450
interesting that way.

247
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:04,680
So let's say we have the
function f of x is equal to x

248
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,210
squared minus 4x, and the
interval that I care about

249
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,880
here is between, is a closed
interval, so I'm including

250
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,880
2, from 2 to 4.

251
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,200
Now, the mean value theorem
tells us that if this

252
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,050
function is defined on this
interval, and it is, right?

253
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,380
We could put any number.

254
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,180
The domain of this is actually
all real numbers, I could put

255
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,050
any number here, so obviously
it's going to be defined

256
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,990
over this interval.

257
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,140
But so it's defined over the
interval, this is continuous,

258
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,870
this is differentiable.

259
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,160
You could take the derivative,
and the derivative

260
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,380
is continuous.

261
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,810
So the mean value theorem
should apply here.

262
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,960
So let's see what value of
c is equal to the average

263
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,400
slope between 2 and 4.

264
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,700
So what's the average
slope between 2 and 4?

265
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,780
Well, it's going to be f of 4,
so the change in the function,

266
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:59,900
f of 4 minus f of 2 divided by
the change in x, so 4 minus 2.

267
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,460
So this equal to
the average slope.

268
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,800
So f of 4 is 16
minus 16, right?

269
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
So that's 0.

270
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,370
Let me make sure of that.

271
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,740
4 times 4, 16, minus 4
times 4, 16, right.

272
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,560
Minus f of 2.

273
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,500
f of 2 is 2 squared,
is 4, right, and then

274
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,730
minus 4 times 2.

275
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,630
So minus 8.

276
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,810
   

277
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,390
All of that over 2.

278
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,060
And so this equals minus 4.

279
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,120
So this equals 4 over 2.

280
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,700
So the average slope from
x is equal to 2 to x

281
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,420
is equal to 4 is 2.

282
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,350
And now the mean value theorem
tells us, that there must be

283
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,670
some point that's between these
two, maybe including one of

284
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,340
those, where the slope at that
point is exactly equal to 2.

285
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,900
Let's figure out
what point that is.

286
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,390
That c.

287
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,720
Let's take the derivative,
because the derivative at c

288
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,620
is going to be equal to 2.

289
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,690
So we just take the derivative.

290
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:04,110
So let's say f prime of x
is equal to 2x minus four.

291
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,990
And we want to figure out, at
what x value does this equal 2.

292
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,600
So we say,

293
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,460
2x minus 4 is equal to 2.

294
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,030
Where does the slope equal 2?

295
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:24,000
And you get 2x is equal
to 6, x is equal to 3.

296
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,880
So if x is equal to 3, the
derivative is exactly equal

297
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,630
to the average slope.

298
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,990
But let me see if I can,
let me get the graphing

299
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,540
calculator here.

300
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,910
Let me what I can do.

301
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,980
OK.

302
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,090
So here's the graph of
x squared minus 4x.

303
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,600
Let me see if I can make
it a little bit bigger.

304
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,920
   

305
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,050
The interval that we care
about is from here to here.

306
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,910
So the average slope over
that interval was 2.

307
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,010
So if we were to draw the
slope, it was like that, the

308
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,900
slope would look like that.

309
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,930
And at the point 3, the
slope is exactly 2.

310
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,540
So let me actually draw that.

311
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,320
This isn't too hard
to draw, for myself.

312
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,540
Let me see.

313
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:21,270
So if that's the x-axis, I'll
want that graph out of the way.

314
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,160
That's the y-axis.

315
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,960
   

316
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,820
So the graph goes through
the point 0, 0 as

317
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,010
neatly as possible.

318
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,990
Nope, that's not neat.

319
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,680
   

320
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,610
So the graph goes something
like this, it dips up, then it

321
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,610
goes like that, and actually
it keeps going straight up,

322
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,660
like that, it's a parabola.

323
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,620
So this is point 4.

324
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,210
The point 2 is here.

325
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:56,150
And at 2 we're at negative
4, so the vertex is at

326
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,710
the point 2, minus four.

327
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,390
So what we said, the average
slope, so the closed interval

328
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,280
that we care about, between 2
and 4, it's from 2

329
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,960
here to 4 here.

330
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,160
That's the interval, 2 to 4.

331
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,850
The average slope is 2.

332
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,570
Doesn't look like it, only
because I've kind of

333
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,010
compressed the y-axis.

334
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,090
And we're saying, at the point
x is equal to 3, the slope

335
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,010
is equal to exactly that.

336
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,180
So at x is equal to three,
the slope is equal

337
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,860
to the same thing.

338
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,620
That's all the mean
value theorem is.

339
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,840
I know sounds complicated.

340
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,810
People talk about continuity,
and differentiability, and f

341
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,520
prime of c, and all this, but
all it says is, there's some

342
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,020
point between these two points
where the instantaneous slope,

343
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,690
or slope exactly at that
point, is equal to the slope

344
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,510
between these two points.

345
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,650
Hope I didn't confuse you.
