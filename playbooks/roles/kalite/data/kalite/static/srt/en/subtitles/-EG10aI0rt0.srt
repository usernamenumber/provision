1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,771
Lets say we have the relationship y is equal to cosine of five x minus three y

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:09,571
and what I want to find is the rate of which y is changing with respect to x

3
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:11,036
and we'll assume that y is a function of x

4
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:13,639
So lets do what weve always been doing

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:20,372
lets apply the derivative operator to both sides of this equation

6
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:26,236
On the left side of the equation, right here, we get dy/dx is equal to

7
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:29,835
Now here on the right hand side were going to apply the chain rule

8
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:42,502
The derivative of the cosine of something with respect to that something is going to be equal to negative sine of that something

9
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:46,169
so negative sine of five x minus three y

10
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:50,372
and then we have to multiply that by the derivative of that something with respect to x.

11
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:53,370
So whats the derivative of that something with respect to x?

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,917
Well the derivative of five x with respect to x is five

13
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:08,146
and the derivative of negative three y with respect to x is negative three times dy/dx

14
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:12,305
The negative three times the derivative of y with respect to x

15
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,003
and now we just need to solve for dy/dx

16
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:19,336
As you can see with some of these implicit differentiation problems, this is the hard part

17
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:23,840
Actually let me make that dy/dx the same color, so we can keep track of it easier

18
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:29,762
So this is going to be dy/dx and then I can close the parentheses

19
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:35,009
So how can we do it? Its just going to be a little bit of algebra to work through

20
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:35,224
Well we can distribute the sine of five x minus 3 y, so let me rewrite everything

21
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:47,600
You can distribute the sine of five x minus three y - you get, let me rewrite everything. You're going to get dy/dx. Your distribute the negative sine, youre going to have five x minus three y

22
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:07,971
all of this, so youre going to have negative five times the sine of five

23
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:13,036
x minus three y and then youre going have the negative times the negative

24
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:19,170
You end up with a positive and so youre going to end up with plus three

25
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:26,504
times the sine of five x minus three y

26
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:33,670
dy/dx

27
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:40,104
Now what we can do is subtract three sine of five x minus three y from both sides

28
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:45,102
So, this is essentially one dy/dx

29
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:49,004
So if we subtract this from both sides we are left with

30
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:51,837
So one the left side were going to have a one dy/dx

31
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:56,005
and were going to subtract from that three sine of five x minus three y dy/dx's

32
00:02:56,005 --> 00:03:01,037
Youre going to have one minus three

33
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:03,253
Ill keep the color for three for fun

34
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:10,168
three sine of five x minus three y dy/dx's

35
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:15,037
on the left hand side

36
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:19,042
is going to be equal to

37
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:23,038
well we subtracted thsi from both sides, so on the right hand side this is going to go away

38
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:32,921
So were just going to be left with a negative five sine of five x minus three y

39
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,438
and were in the home stretch now! To solve for dy/dx

40
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:39,669
You just have to divide both sides of the equation by this and we are left with

41
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:44,168
dy/dx is equal to

42
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:48,171
this thing, negative five times the sine

43
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:51,904
of five x minus three y

44
00:03:51,904 --> 00:04:01,770
all of that over one minus three sine

45
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,770
of five x minus three y and we are done
