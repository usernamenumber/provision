99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, every winter a lot of kids come in

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and see me because they've got

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
flu and I've got to make a decision.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For each one of them, I've got to decide

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Am I going to get the flu test in this particular child?

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, when I see a kid that's sick

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here's what I'm thinking

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm thinking, well, the first thing I've got to decide is

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
do I really suspect the flu?

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is when I ask a lot of questions

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the person who's sick or the parents.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I say, "Well, when did it start?"

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Was it abrupt?"

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's my first clue that it really is the flu.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The second clue is, "How long did it last?"

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They might say, "You know, we're in the middle of it.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's been a few days."

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But if they tell me it's been weeks and weeks

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and months and months, then of course I'm thinking

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's something else. It's not the flu then.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And, finally, if they tell me that they're having

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
respiratory symptoms, then that's of course really important.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That sounds like the flu.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But, they also have to have some constitutional symptoms.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They have to have a fever or fatigue to convince me

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that this sounds like the flu.
