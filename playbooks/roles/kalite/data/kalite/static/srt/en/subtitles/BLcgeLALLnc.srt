1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
   

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,420
So let's think about what we
did in that last video and

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,160
maybe do it in a little
bit more of a visual way.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,280
So let's say this rectangle
that I'm about to draw is

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:19,660
the set of all the things
that I guess can happen.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,430
It's a set of all
of the outcomes.

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,990
And we know from the get-go,
and we're still doing that same

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,300
example where I have a bag of
coins and one of them

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,890
only has heads on it.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,880
Two sides are heads, the
other ones are normal.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,090
So, if this is the whole set of
things we know that there's a

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,060
1/10 chance that we pick the
coin that only has heads.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,510
So let me say out of
this area-- I don't

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,370
know-- this is 1/2.

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,690
That's 1/4.

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,960
So 1/10 is going to be
about that much, roughly.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,280
So this area right here.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,880
   

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,520
And let me color it.

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,690
Let me color it a color.

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,410
So that area right there, this
is the chances that we got

22
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,450
the two-sided sided coin.

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,620
   

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,080
And this whole area, this
is all a normal coin.

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,090
   

26
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,800
And then we said, oh, you know,
what are the chances that

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,760
we get 5 heads in a row?

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,350
Well, if we had a normal coin,
there was a 1 out of 32 chance

29
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,880
that we get 5 heads in a row.

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,670
So whatever this area
is, 1 out of 32.

31
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,880
So I'll do it in a column.

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,200
It's roughly there.

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,460
It can be a little messy.

34
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:36,790
And I'm assuming that this
column right here is 1/32

35
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,060
of this normal area.

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,790
   

37
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:46,370
So this is a situation of
normal-- I'll just write this

38
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,090
as n-- and that upside down
U means and in set theory.

39
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,380
Or it's a kind of intersection.

40
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,100
But it means and I got
5 out of 5 heads.

41
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,800
   

42
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,470
And if we think about,
what is the area of this?

43
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,480
Well, it's going to be
the area-- it's 1/32

44
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,550
of the normal area.

45
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,570
And the normal area is 9/10.

46
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,820
So this is equal to the
normal area, which is 9/10.

47
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,400
And then 1/32 of that.

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,710
Times 1/32.

49
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,210
Or you could also, another way
of viewing that area, you could

50
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,930
say that well, that area,
that's the probability-- I'll

51
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,180
do it in the same color.

52
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,240
That's the probability of
me getting-- I'll just

53
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,140
write 5 out of 5.

54
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,120
5 out of 5 means 5
out of 5 heads.

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,590
That's what probability of
getting 5 out of 5 heads

56
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,880
given that I picked
a normal coin out.

57
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,470
   

58
00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:00,450
Times the probability that I
picked out a normal coin.

59
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,770
And so this is 1 out of 32,
and this is 9 out of 10.

60
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,130
And I'm assuming that the
area of this entire magenta

61
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,750
rectangle I already
drew, that's 1 or 100%.

62
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,000
Or however you want to view it.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,150
And so this is 1 out of
32 times 9 out of 10.

64
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,050
So this is 9 out of 32.

65
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,430
So this whole thing, the area
this entire of this entire

66
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,310
magenta rectangle, is 1.

67
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:35,390
Then the area of this that I
just shaded in, this is 9/320.

68
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,760
Another way of viewing this,
this is also the probability--

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,920
this area right here is also
the probability that I got

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,560
5 out of 5 and that I
picked the normal coin.

71
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,820
So that's also equal to.

72
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,430
Both of those things
are true in this area.

73
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,560
In this area, if I have a point
in that area-- this might be a

74
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,210
little abstract for you-- if at
any point, it is true that I

75
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,100
got 5 out of 5, and I have
picked a normal coin.

76
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,630
So that's also going to be
equal to and I'm doing an

77
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,510
arbitrary color change here.

78
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,310
9 out of 320.

79
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,390
So we could say in general,
that the probability of me

80
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:25,920
getting 5 out of 5 coins, given
that I got a normal coin times

81
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,960
the probability that I got the
normal coin-- that is going

82
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,160
to be equal that 5 out of 5
happens and I got the normal.

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,920
That equals probability
of 5 out of 5, and I

84
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,600
got the normal coin.

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,810
Fair enough.

86
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,350
Let's go to the
other side of this.

87
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,670
This kind of yellowish
color here.

88
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,610
There's a probability I
got a two-sided coin.

89
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,125
And then given that, what's
the probability that

90
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,630
I get 5 out of 5?

91
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,800
Well, pretty much,
this entire area.

92
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,930
It's also true that
I get 5 out of 5.

93
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,060
   

94
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:14,190
So the probability that I get 5
out of 5 and two-sided, it's

95
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,640
equal to the probability--
oh sorry, and.

96
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,600
And two-sided, is equal to the
probability of 5 out of 5,

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,290
given the two-sided coin
times the probability

98
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,710
of the two-sided coin.

99
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,200
So this is 1, right?

100
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,610
If I got the two-sided coin I'm
definitely going to 5 out of 5,

101
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,670
That's why this whole
area is filled in.

102
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,410
And then, the probability of
the two-sided coin we know

103
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,410
already is 1 out of 10.

104
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,090
So this area is 1 out of 10.

105
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,980
   

106
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,840
And so what is the total area
where I have 5 out of 5?

107
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,340
Well, it's going to be
this area over here,

108
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,070
which I figured out.

109
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,530
Which was 9/320 of this
entire rectangle.

110
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,250
And then this whole area is
also another area where I

111
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,460
got 5 out of 5 because I
picked the two-sided coin.

112
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,640
And that's 1/10.

113
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,020
In the last video we would
essentially-- if we want to

114
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,770
know the chances of getting
5 out of 5, it's this

115
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,960
total rectangle.

116
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,937
I say this without showing
you anything, so let

117
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,120
me-- it'll be red.

118
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,840
   

119
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
And I think you get the point.

120
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,000
That is the 5 out of 5,
so it's going to be this

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
area plus this area.

122
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:34,340
And that is why it was 9 out
of 320 plus 1 out of 10.

123
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,890
And we had the
answer last time.

124
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,130
Fair enough.

125
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:43,350
So let me pose a slightly
more difficult problem.

126
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,850
I don't know if I should have
just erased that, but I did.

127
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,280
So let's move forward.

128
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,780
What is the probability that I
picked the two-sided coin given

129
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,530
that I got 5 out of 5 heads?

130
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,170
   

131
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,370
And remember, this is different
than the probability that I get

132
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,270
5 out of 5 heads given
the two-sided coin.

133
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,230
What's the difference?

134
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,680
This says I picked the
two-sided coin, now what's the

135
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,340
probability I got 5 out of 5?

136
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,680
Well that's equal to 1.

137
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,230
We're guaranteed to get a
million heads in a row.

138
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,130
But this says I put my hand in
the bag, I didn't look at which

139
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,660
coin I got, I just flipped it
five times and I know that

140
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,860
I got 5 heads in a row.

141
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,720
So now I say, well, what is the
probability without looking at

142
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,070
the coin, what is the
probability that this was

143
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,830
the two-sided coin
that I picked up?

144
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,590
Well, we can go back to
what we said before.

145
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,150
Let me just say it a
little bit abstract.

146
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,920
Before I clear this, we know
that the probability of a

147
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:49,860
given b, or the probability
of-- well, actually.

148
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,000
Let me start over.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,300
The probability of a and b
happening, if you remember that

150
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,270
thing that before I erased it,
is a probability of a given

151
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,050
that b happened times the
probability that b happens.

152
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,820
If both of these things have to
happen then we could say, well,

153
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,300
definitely b has to happen.

154
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,780
And then, whatever the
probability of a happening

155
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,690
given that b happened.

156
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,060
This could be exclusive events.

157
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,790
If these are independent
this could be equal to the

158
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,620
probability of a times
the probability of b.

159
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,390
But we don't know for sure that
they're exclusive events.

160
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,210
So the probability of a given b
could be the probability of a.

161
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,330
It might not be dependent on b
at all, but we don't know that.

162
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,470
Let's ignore that.

163
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,630
So the probability of
a given b is that.

164
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,540
But we also know that the
probability of a given

165
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:45,540
b is equal to-- I mean,
the probability-- sorry.

166
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,350
We also know the probability of
a and b is also the same thing

167
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,580
as the probability of
b and a happening.

168
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
The same thing.

169
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,630
And so that's the probability
of b given that a happened,

170
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,150
times the probability
that a happened.

171
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,670
By the same logic.

172
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,900
Well, we see that this is
equal to this, so this

173
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,500
has to be equal to that.

174
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,212
So let's write that down.

175
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:09,960
And we're going to do a lot of
applications; I know this is

176
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,440
a little abstract right now.

177
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,920
So that tells us the
probability of a given b times

178
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,990
the probability of b, is equal
to the probability of b given

179
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,690
a, times the probability of a.

180
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,810
And then, let's just
divide both sides by a.

181
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,160
And we get this, the
probability of b given

182
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,490
a is equal to this,
probability of a given b.

183
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,390
Times the probability
of b divided by the

184
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,120
probability of a.

185
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,600
And this is called Bayes'
theorem or Bayes' law.

186
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,210
And this is what we will now
use to figure out the

187
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,930
probability that we got the
two-sided coin after seeing

188
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,930
that we rolled or we
got 5 heads in a row.

189
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,870
See you in the next video.
