1
00:00:59,257 --> 00:01:01,394
say "Hey, this is going to be a 2".

2
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,716
But what we'll do in this video is to think

3
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:05,666
How to troubleshoot these problems systematically.

4
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,267
Because what we'll find is that as more and more complicated

5
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:10,728
are these equations, you will not be able to

6
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:12,586
simply think about them and do them in your head

7
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:15,418
So it is very important that you first understand how

8
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:16,733
manipulate these equations, but even more important is

9
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,251
understand what they really represent

10
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:21,920
This literally just says 7 times x equals fourteen

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,753
In algebra, do not write "times" ali

12
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:28,422
When you write two numbers side-by-side or a number close

13
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,419
a variable like this, that means you

14
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:32,090
are multiplying

15
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,087
It is just a shorthand, a notion of shorthand

16
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:36,595
And usually we do not use the multiplication sign because

17
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:41,067
He is confused, because x is the most common variable

18
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,400
used in algebra

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:49,412
And if I had to write 7 times x equals 14, if I write my

20
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:52,400
sign of "times" or my x so a bit strange, it may seem

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,985
as xx "or" times "times"

22
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:57,400
So usually when you're dealing with equations,

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,933
especially when one of the variables is an x, you

24
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:01,255
would not use the traditional sign of multiplication

25
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:05,434
You can use something like this--you can use the point to

26
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:06,595
represent the multiplication

27
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:10,403
Then you can have 7 times is equal to 14

28
00:02:10,403 --> 00:02:13,004
But this is still a little unusual

29
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:14,908
If you have something multiplied by a variable

30
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:16,766
you just going to write 7 x

31
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:19,738
This literally means 7 times x

32
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:22,478
Now, to understand how you can manipulate this equation to

33
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:25,403
solve it, let's see a thing

34
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:27,493
Then 7 times x, what is this?

35
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:29,815
This is the same as--so I'll just rewrite this

36
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,323
equation, but I'll rewrite it in visual form

37
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:35,388
Soon, 7 times x

38
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,081
Soon this literally means x added yourself 7 times

39
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:40,403
This is the definition of multiplication

40
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:48,484
So that's literally x x x x more more more more x--let's see,

41
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:51,735
This is 5 x 's--more x more x

42
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:55,589
Soon this right there is literally 7 x's

43
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:57,168
This is 7 x, right there

44
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:58,143
Let me rewrite it

45
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:03,716
This right here is 7 x

46
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:07,664
Now, this equation tells us that equals 7 x 14

47
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:11,472
Then, just assuming this is equal to 14

48
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:14,072
Let me draw 14 objects here

49
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:19,831
So let me say I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

50
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:23,467
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

51
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:26,936
So literally we're talking 7 x equals 14 things

52
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:29,398
These are equivalent statements

53
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:32,741
Now, the reason why I drew it that way is to

54
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:35,388
you really understand what we will do when we

55
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:37,664
We divide both sides by 7

56
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,800
So let me erase it right here

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,398
Then, the default step every time--I didn't want to do this,

58
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:47,867
Let me do this, let me draw this last circle

59
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:53,407
So in General, whenever you simplify an equation to a

60
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:56,147
â€“ a coefficient is only one number by multiplying

61
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:57,308
the variable

62
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:58,748
So, some number by multiplying the variable or we can call

63
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,837
the coefficient times the variable is equal to

64
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:03,159
something

65
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,249
What you want to do is just divide both sides by 7

66
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,757
in this case, or divide both sides by the coefficient

67
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:12,494
So if you divide both sides by 7, what do you have?

68
00:04:12,494 --> 00:04:16,255
7 times something divided by 7 is only

69
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,252
This original thing

70
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:22,664
7 's if void and 14 divided by 7 is 2

71
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:26,751
Then your solution is x equals 2

72
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,398
But just to make this very tangible in your head, what

73
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:32,742
is happening here is that when we divide both sides of the

74
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:36,410
the equation by 7, we literally we divide both sides by 7

75
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,664
This is an equation

76
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:39,800
If you are saying that this is equal to it

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,469
Anything I do on the left I will have to do on the right

78
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:46,163
If they started being equal, I can't just do an operation

79
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:48,400
on the one hand and in doing so continue being equal

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,482
They were the same thing

81
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:54,986
So if I split the left side by 7, so let me break it

82
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:56,054
in seven groups

83
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:59,816
Soon there are seven x's here, so that's one, two, three,

84
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,813
four, five, six, seven

85
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,460
So that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven groups

86
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,664
Now, if I divide it into seven groups, I also want to

87
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:11,400
divide the right side into seven groups

88
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,999
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

89
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:19,599
So, if this whole thing is equal to this whole thing, so each

90
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:26,008
one of these small pieces that break, these seven pieces,

91
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:28,330
shall be equivalent

92
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,674
So that piece, we can say, is equal to that piece

93
00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:35,064
This piece is equal to this piece--they are

94
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:36,132
all pieces are equivalent

95
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:37,711
There are seven pieces here, seven pieces here

96
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:41,798
Soon, every x must be equal to two of these objects

97
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:46,720
Soon, we have x is equal to, in this case--in this case

98
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,414
We had the drawn objects where there are two

99
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:51,132
of them. x is equal to 2

100
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:54,067
Now, let's just use two other examples here only for

101
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,823
really get into your mind that we are dealing with an equation,

102
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,005
and any operation that you make on one side of the equation

103
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:00,792
You must be on the other side

104
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:04,507
So let me turn down a bit more

105
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:13,656
So let's say that I have, I say, I have 3 x equals 15

106
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:15,931
Now, once again, you may be able to do it in your head

107
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:18,160
You're saying this is saying 3 times some

108
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,467
number is equal to 15

109
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:22,247
You can use your multiplication table 3 and figure out

110
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:25,498
But if you just wanted to do this systematically, and that

111
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:27,820
It is good to understand systematically, you say OK, this

112
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,420
thing on the left is equal to this thing in the right

113
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,742
What should I do with this thing on the left

114
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:33,718
to have only one x there?

115
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:36,504
Well, to have only the x, I need to divide it by 3

116
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:39,801
and my motivation to do this and that ' 3 times

117
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:43,795
anything divided by 3, 3 's Cancel and I stay

118
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:45,400
with only the x

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,742
now, 3 x 15 was equal to

120
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:53,129
If I am splitting the left side by 3, for equality

121
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:57,495
be satisfied, I need to divide the right side by 3.

122
00:06:57,495 --> 00:06:58,749
What this in '?

123
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:01,256
The left side, the left side only

124
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:04,414
an x, then we have just the x

125
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:07,804
and the right side, and ' 15 divided by 3?

126
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:11,752
This and ' 5.

127
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:13,749
Now you could have done this equacao slightly

128
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,257
different, even though they are equivalent

129
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:21,086
If you start with 3 x equals 15, then we can say that

130
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:25,405
instead of dividing by 3, I can just see me free to 3

131
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:28,331
I can stick with the left side only equal to x, if I multiply both sides by

132
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,142
the equacao by 1/3

133
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:34,322
then if I multiply that estimate the equacao on both sides by 1/3

134
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:36,319
This also works

135
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,130
you say, 1/3 of 3 and 1.

136
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,170
When we multiply this part, 1/3 times

137
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,932
3, this and ' x

138
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:51,737
1 x e ' equal to 15 times 1/3 and ' equal to 5

139
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:56,799
and a 1 time x and ' the same as x, and this is the same thing

140
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,656
where x is equal to 5

141
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:02,046
and these two forms are equivalent to solve this

142
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:05,994
If we divide both sides by 3, this and ' equivalent to

143
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:10,916
multiply both side of equacao by 1/3

144
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,588
Now let's do one more and I'll make it a little

145
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:14,467
more complicated

146
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:17,325
I'll modify the ft<u>min</u>word_len a little

147
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:36,923
Let's say I have more 4y 2y = 18

148
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:38,502
now, suddenly it's a little harder and

149
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:39,663
to make this twin

150
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:41,334
We are saying that something twice over 4 times that

151
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:45,839
thing and ' equal to 18

152
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,068
and ' harder to think that number is this

153
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,415
You can try

154
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:52,062
Let's say we have 1 is 2 times 4 times 1, 1 more

155
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:53,409
and it does not work

156
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,174
but let's consider systematically solve this

157
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:56,752
You can try to guess and you can reach

158
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:58,146
the answer, but how do we do it systematically?

159
00:08:58,146 --> 00:09:00,328
Let's show

160
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:02,279
If two y's terms, what does that mean?

161
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:09,152
This means literally that I have two y's summed up with one another

162
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:12,263
IE and ' y y more

163
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:15,003
and so I'm adding 4 y's

164
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:19,137
that I am joining 4 y 's, who literally are four

165
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:20,808
y's added with one another

166
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:24,338
logo and ' y y y y more more more

167
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:29,075
and that has to be equal to 18

168
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:35,251
and that and ' equal to 18

169
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:39,059
now, how many y's I have on the left?

170
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:41,149
How many y's I have?

171
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:45,747
I have one, two, three, four, five, six y's

172
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:48,812
Thus we can simplify this as 6y and ' equal to 18

173
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:51,134
and if you think about it, this makes sense

174
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:56,799
so this here, the more 4 y and 2y ' 6y

175
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,793
then more 4y 2y and ' 6y, and this makes sense

176
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:03,672
If we have two more litters 4 stretchers, I'll

177
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:04,833
have 6 stretchers

178
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,620
If I have more y 2y's 4 ' s, I'll have 6 y's

179
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,174
and this is equal to 18

180
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:15,422
and now, we know how to do this

181
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:18,162
If I have 6 times something equal to 18, if we divide the two sides

182
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:22,481
the equacao by 6, do I solve the equacao

183
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:30,793
then divide the left by 6, and divide the

184
00:10:30,793 --> 00:10:32,744
so I figur by law 6

185
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:39,478
and we then y equals 3

186
00:10:39,478 --> 00:10:40,499
and you can try

187
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:41,985
This and ' and ' cool about a equacao

188
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:44,261
You can always check if you got the right answer

189
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:45,933
Let's see if this works

190
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:52,249
2 times 3 times 3 and 4 more ' to that?

191
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:56,335
2 times 3, this and ' equal to 6

192
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:59,493
and then 4 times 3 and ' equal to 12

193
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,998
6 more ' equal to 12 and 18

194
00:11:03,998 --> 99:59:59,999
soon this works
