1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:02,392
We're asked to solve the equation

2
00:00:02,392 --> 00:00:07,639
"three plus the principle square root of five x plus six is equal to twelve"

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,070
And so the general strategy to solve this type of

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,887
equation, is to isolate the radical sign on one side

5
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:15,488
of the equation, and then you can square it to

6
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:17,624
essentially get the radical sign to go away.

7
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:19,992
But you have to be very careful there, because when you

8
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:22,793
square radical signs you actually lose the information that

9
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:24,822
you were taking the principle square root, not the

10
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:27,051
negative square root or not the plus-or-minus square root.

11
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:29,652
You're only taking the positive square root. And so

12
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:32,299
when we get our final answer, we do have to check

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,828
and make sure it gels with taking the principle square root.

14
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,243
So let's try, let's see what I'm talking about.

15
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:40,240
So the first thing I want to do, is I want to isolate

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,298
this on one side of the equation. The best way to isolate that

17
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:45,302
is to get rid of this three. And the best way to get rid of the

18
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:47,717
three is to subtract three from the left hand side. And of

19
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:49,807
course if I do it on the left-hand side I also have to do

20
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:51,572
it on the right-hand side. Otherwise I would

21
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:55,380
lose the ability to say that they are equal. And so the

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,327
left-hand side right over here simplifies to the

23
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:04,203
principle square root of five x plus six. And this is equal to

24
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:07,965
Twelve minus three. This is equal to nine. And now we can

25
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:12,702
square both sides of this equation. So we can square

26
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:15,163
five, the principle square root of five x plus six

27
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:20,132
and we can square nine. When you do this, when you do this,

28
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:24,126
when you square this, you get five x, five x plus six.

29
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,401
If you square the square root of five x plus six you're

30
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,049
going to get five x plus six! And this is where we actually

31
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,206
lost some information, because we would have also gotten

32
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:35,875
this if we squared the negative square root of five x plus six.

33
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,476
And so that's why we have to be careful with the answers

34
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:40,891
we get, and actually make sure it works when the original

35
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,141
equation was the principle square root. So we get

36
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:47,207
five x plus six on the left-hand side, and on the right-hand side

37
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,550
we get eighty-one. And now this is just a straight-up linear

38
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,244
equation. We want to isolate the x terms. We'll subtract

39
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:57,238
six from both sides. Subtract six from both sides.

40
00:01:57,238 --> 00:02:00,628
On the left-hand side we have five x, and on the right-hand

41
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:05,365
side we have seventy-five. And then we can divide both sides by five.

42
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:11,495
Divide both sides by five, we get x is equal to... Let's see..

43
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:16,231
x it-it's fifteen. Right? Five times ten is fifty,

44
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:19,389
five times five is twenty-five, which is seventy-five.

45
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,315
So we get x is equal to fifteen. But we want - We need to

46
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:25,055
make sure that this actually works for our original equation.

47
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,052
Maybe this would have, maybe this would have

48
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:29,049
worked if we were taking - If this was the negative

49
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,814
square root. So we need to make sure it actually works

50
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:32,578
for the positive square root, for the principle square root.

51
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,365
So let's apply it to our original equation. So we get

52
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:41,216
three plus the principle square root of five times fifteen.

53
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:46,046
So seventy-five plus six, seventy-five plus six

54
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:49,622
plus six, so I just took five times fifteen over here, I've put

55
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:52,733
our solution in, should be equal to twelve. So we get

56
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:56,216
three plus square root of seventy-five plus six is eighty-one

57
00:02:56,216 --> 00:03:00,628
it's equal to twelve. And this is the principle root of

58
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:03,972
eighty-one, so it's positive nine. So it's three plus nine

59
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:07,408
needs to be equal to twelve, which is absolutely true.

60
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:10,148
So we can feel pretty good about this answer.
