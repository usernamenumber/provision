1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,710
I have a problem here
from my cousin.

3
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,410
Let's see what it says.

4
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,450
It says Milwaukee, Wisconsin
is directly west of Grand

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,630
Haven, Michigan, on opposite
sides of Lake Michigan.

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,020
So let me draw that.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:19,535
So if we say that this
right here is Milwaukee.

8
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:23,570
   

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,760
It's due west of Grand
Haven, Michigan.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,110
So if I were to draw-- let
me draw a horizontal line.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,145
We're going over water so
let me do it in blue.

12
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:37,710
It's due west of Grand
Haven, Michigan.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,640
You know, you go straight east.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,240
If I were to go straight
east, I would get to

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,870
Grand Haven, Michigan.

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,430
Which is right here.

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,540
Let me just label that, g.

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,350
All right.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,840
On a foggy night, a law
enforcement boat leaves

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,190
from Milwaukee on a
course of 105 degrees.

21
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,910
   

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,570
The hardest part of these
problems, in my opinion, is

23
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,970
really just trying to figure
out the convention

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,300
they're using.

25
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,560
When they say a course of 105
degrees, what does that mean?

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,860
What direction is it?

27
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,330
And I checked with my cousin,
and her book says that in, I

28
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,710
guess in the boating world,
the course is how many

29
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,800
degrees clockwise you're
going, of due north.

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,230
So due north is 0 degrees.

31
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,370
So 105 degrees.

32
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,590
So due north would
be 0 degrees.

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,310
Due north would be--
that's 0 degrees.

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,100
So he's going 105 degrees
clockwise of that.

35
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,090
So if we 105 degrees-- so
he's going 105 degrees.

36
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,060
So that's like 105 degrees.

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,700
Something like that.

38
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,090
He's going 105 degrees.

39
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,860
And I'll do him in magenta.

40
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,160
His course is 105 degrees.

41
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:53,100
So that's 105 degrees
clockwise of due north.

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,120
And what is that-- oh, it's
like my screen just backed up.

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,030
So what is that angle, in kind
of what we're familiar with?

44
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,970
Well, this would be 90
degrees right here.

45
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,520
Going here.

46
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,220
And then he goes
15 more degrees.

47
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,770
So in kind of unit circle
terms, this would be

48
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,040
negative 15 degrees.

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,540
Or if we wanted to figure out
the angle of this vertex right

50
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,710
here, that would be 90, and
then we'd go another 15.

51
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,530
So this angle right here
is going to be what?

52
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,080
It's going to be 15 degrees.

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,530
Because he said his
course is 105.

54
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,700
So 90 plus 15 is 105.

55
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,610
So how much south he's going
of, kind of, straight

56
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,590
west-east, is 15 degrees.

57
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,990
This whole thing is 105.

58
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,880
OK, let me keep
reading the problem.

59
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,660
He leaves from Milwaukee at a
course of 105 degrees at the

60
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,910
same time that a small
smuggling craft steers a

61
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,820
course of 195 degrees
from Grand Haven.

62
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,710
195 degrees.

63
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,510
So once again, due
north is 0 degrees.

64
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,560
And this guy's going 195.

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,940
So we figure-- this is
just a convention.

66
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,910
You figure out-- well,
he's going 195 degrees

67
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,260
clockwise of due north.

68
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,350
So 195 degrees is going to be--
let's see, it's going to be

69
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,790
a 180 degrees and then some.

70
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,070
It's going to be like that.

71
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,350
So his course is going to
look something like this.

72
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,920
   

73
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,090
His course is going to
look something like that.

74
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,770
And let's see if we can
figure out what this

75
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,870
angle right here is.

76
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,180
Because we, as you can kind of
see where this is going, we're

77
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,820
trying to figure out probably
the size of this triangle,

78
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,330
if I had to guess.

79
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,330
I haven't even read the
whole problem yet.

80
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,490
Let's see.

81
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,150
So he's going 195 degrees.

82
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,690
So if we were to drop,
well, like here.

83
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,450
This right here is a 180
degrees, to go clockwise from

84
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,530
straight up to straight down.

85
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,950
This is 180.

86
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,480
And so he went 195.

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,515
So this is going to be-- that's
going to be 15 degrees.

88
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:48,090
   

89
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,750
And if this angle is 15
degrees, what is this

90
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,960
angle going to be?

91
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,050
Well, this entire angle
is 90 degrees, right?

92
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,790
It's kind of the third
quadrant when we're thinking

93
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,330
in unit circle terms.

94
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,810
So this angle right
here is going to be 90

95
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,100
minus this 15 degrees.

96
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,200
So what's 90 minus 15?

97
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,930
It's 75, right?

98
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,885
75 degrees.

99
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:13,880
   

100
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,890
And if we wanted to convert
his, kind of, course angles

101
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,220
into unit circles-- you know,
with unit circles, you start

102
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,980
here and you go all the
way around this way.

103
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,720
So I think you would get
something like 255 degrees.

104
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,020
But anyway.

105
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,200
So we figured out that this
angle is 15 degrees, this

106
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,100
angle is 75 degrees.

107
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,380
What's this angle going to be?

108
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,260
This angle is going to be--
these all have to add

109
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,290
up to 180, right?

110
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:40,255
So this is going to be
180 minus 15 minus 75.

111
00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:41,250
And what's that?

112
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,550
That's 180 minus 90.

113
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,210
So 180 minus 90 is 90 degrees!

114
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,600
So this angle here
is 90 degrees.

115
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,060
It's a right angle.

116
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,770
It's a right angle.

117
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,610
Interesting.

118
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,210
OK, so what do they tell us?

119
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,660
They tell us the law
enforcement boat

120
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,580
averages 23 knots.

121
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,710
So he's traveling in this
direction at 23 knots.

122
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,790
All right, that's a little bit
faster than 23 miles per hour.

123
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,790
And collides with the
smuggling craft.

124
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,850
What was the smuggling
boat's average speed?

125
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,940
So they both leave their
respective sites at the

126
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,210
same time, and they
both collide, right?

127
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,420
So the time they
traveled is the same.

128
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,200
Let's call that time, t.

129
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,640
Right?

130
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,060
I don't know.

131
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,890
They both left at the same
time and it took some

132
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,780
time for them to collide.

133
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,230
So let's say that the time
between when they left and

134
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,340
the time they collided is t.

135
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,350
So how far did the
patrol boat travel?

136
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,590
Well, he traveled at a speed of
23 knots, and it took him time,

137
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,410
t, to get to the collision.

138
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,105
So the distance he
traveled is 23t.

139
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:47,220
   

140
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,570
Speed times time is
equal to distance.

141
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,900
So the length of
this side is 23t.

142
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,260
Similarly, this guy, we
don't know his speed.

143
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,650
Let's call it, I don't know.

144
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,240
Let's call it x.

145
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,390
His speed is x.

146
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,160
But the distance he
travels is x times t.

147
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,920
x times t, right?

148
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,110
So that's the length
of this side.

149
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,850
So let's see if we can
figure out what x is.

150
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,340
So what do we know?

151
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,900
We know a lot about this.

152
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,510
We know this is a right
triangle, et cetera.

153
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,225
We know this angle.

154
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:23,190
So if we wanted to solve
for xt and use this 23t

155
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,130
information, let's see.

156
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,650
We know-- look at this angle.

157
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,230
If we use the 75 degrees, we
know the opposite angle.

158
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,950
The opposite side, sorry.

159
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,120
Which is 23t.

160
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,600
And we know the adjacent
side, which is xt.

161
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,120
So let me write SOHCAHTOA here.

162
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,480
   

163
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,900
So what deals with
opposite and adjacent?

164
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,480
Well, that's tangent, right?

165
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,500
TOA.

166
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:59,130
So if we say the tan of 75
degrees is going to be equal to

167
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:05,340
the opposite side-- 23t-- over
the adjacent side-- that's this

168
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,170
side, opposite over
adjacent-- xt.

169
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,270
Well, the t's
cancel out, right?

170
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,425
The t's cancel out.

171
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:14,460
And let's see if we
can solve for x.

172
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,320
Multiply x times both sides.

173
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,450
You get x tangent of
75 is equal to 23.

174
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,540
And then divide both sides by
the tan of 75 and you get x is

175
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:33,610
equal to 23 divided by the
tangent of 75 degrees.

176
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,840
And so that's our answer.

177
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,480
And if I had to-- well,
actually, I have-- let's see.

178
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,950
Tangent of 75 degrees.

179
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,350
I don't have a calculator
in front of me.

180
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,285
You could calculate it.

181
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:47,240
It's actually going to be
a pretty high number.

182
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,200
So you could try
to fit, you know.

183
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,760
If you have a calculator,
just type in 75 degrees.

184
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,230
Take the tangent of it, and
perform this calculation.

185
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,790
But we've essentially
solved this problem.

186
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,110
I'll see you in the next video.

187
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,400
