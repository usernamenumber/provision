1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,880
Before I go a into an
explanation of why housing

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,340
prices skyrocketed from 2000 to
2006, I think it's a good

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,250
idea to give a little history of
what the housing market and

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,130
the mortgage market used
to be like before

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,680
things got out of control.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,450
So let's go back to,
say, I don't know.

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,030
Let's go back to
the late '70s--

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,840
maybe mid-'70s, actually.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,340
I remember my parents,
they bought a house.

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,330
We lived in New Orleans.

12
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,390
And the house, if I remember
correctly, it

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,040
cost roughly $60,000.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,370
And back then, to buy a house --
and actually, for a while,

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,390
until more recently -- in order
to buy a house you had

16
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,650
to put 25% down.

17
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,430
So 25% of $60,000
is 1/4 of it.

18
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,966
So you have to put
$15,000 down.

19
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:47,510
So you have to save
up $15,000.

20
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,660
And then you're going to get a
mortgage on $45,000, right?

21
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,300
$45,000, you're going
to borrow.

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,430
And I forgot the exact interest
rates then, but I'm

23
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,830
just going to throw
out a number.

24
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,090
This is really just for
instructive purposes.

25
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,920
Let's say interest rates back
then, they were higher.

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,190
They were like 9%, I think.

27
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,260
So 9% on $45,000.

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,900
How much interest am
I going to pay?

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,750
45,000 times 0.09.

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,100
So I'm going to pay a little
over $4,000 a year in

31
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:30,240
interest. Or if I divide by
12, about $340 a month in

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,320
interest.

33
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,760
And I remember at the time, we
actually moved out of our

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,350
house and we rented it out,
because we needed cash.

35
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,280
And we rented out that exact
same house -- and I this is in

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,310
the late '70s or early '80s-- we
rented out that exact same

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,390
house for $900.

38
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,680
The rent was $900.

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,070
So this raises, I guess,
a couple of questions.

40
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,500
First of all, the big question
is, why did those people who

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,210
rented our house -- I mean,
they paid $900 a month.

42
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,289
They must have had a good
income, for that time.

43
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,970
Why were they willing to pay
rent, when they could have

44
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,380
bought a house, where the
mortgage would have been --

45
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,840
interest plus a little principal
-- it would have

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,750
been no more than
$400 a month?

47
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,350
So why would you just throw away
-- this is the classic

48
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,640
rent-versus-buy argument -- why
would you throw away $900,

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,190
where you could actually build
equity paying $400 a month for

50
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,990
the exact same place?

51
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,640
And you can think about
that a little bit.

52
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,510
But there's a bunch
of reasons.

53
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,550
What was necessary to
buy a house then?

54
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,180
Well, one, you needed a
$15,000 down payment.

55
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,100
Maybe these people had really
good cash flow every month,

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,210
but they just never had the
circumstances, or maybe even

57
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,740
the discipline, to
save up $15,000.

58
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,350
You also needed a really
steady job.

59
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,260
So you needed -- this
is the down

60
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,220
payment, this is one thing.

61
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,470
You also needed a steady job.

62
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,330
   

63
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,130
Maybe the people who were
renting, they were working odd

64
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,290
jobs, or they didn't have
a steady income.

65
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:07,850
Although I doubt it.

66
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,750
I don't think we would have
actually leased the house to

67
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,910
them, had that been the case.

68
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,160
They probably had that.

69
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,690
   

70
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,510
And then the last thing you
needed to get a mortgage, you

71
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,800
needed good credit.

72
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,350
   

73
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,840
And maybe these people
didn't have that.

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,500
Maybe they didn't pay some bills
in the past. And they

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,620
just couldn't find a bank that
was willing to give them a

76
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,990
loan, despite having a steady
job and the $15,000 down.

77
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,220
If you have to ask me, I think
the biggest barrier for this

78
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,080
family at that time
was probably the

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,830
$15,000 down payment.

80
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,420
And frankly, they probably had
trouble saving $15,000 because

81
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,840
they were busy paying
$900 in rent.

82
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,400
So that was the circumstance
throughout, actually, most of

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,390
modern history.

84
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,370
That you had this barrier
towards buying a house.

85
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,590
That it did make sense, that the
conventional wisdom that

86
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,650
it is better to buy
than rent held.

87
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,620
It's just, everyone knew that,
but a lot of people just

88
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,670
couldn't buy, even though they
wanted to, because they didn't

89
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,820
have the down payment.

90
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,090
They didn't have
the steady job.

91
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,360
Or they didn't have
the good credit.

92
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,790
That was a circumstance then,
and that lasted for some time.

93
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,490
What happened in the
early 2000s?

94
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,480
And it actually happened in
California in the mid-'90s.

95
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,899
But it got more and more, I
guess we could say, flagrant,

96
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,380
as we went through the decade--
is that people

97
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,800
started lowering these
standards.

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
And I'll do a whole other video
on possibly why those

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,330
standards were lowered.

100
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:36,700
But let's say that in 1980
you needed 25% down.

101
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,350
Let me just switch colors.

102
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,130
That color is kind of ugly.

103
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,380
You needed a steady job.

104
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,630
   

105
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,200
And you needed a,
I don't know.

106
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,290
Let's say you needed
a 700 credit score.

107
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,620
And that was true from 1980
to, let's say, 2000.

108
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,570
I'm exaggerating a bit.

109
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,460
But this is just to give you
the broad sense of what

110
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,140
actually happened.

111
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,310
But let's say then, in 2001 --
and I'll explain later why

112
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,590
this might have happened -- the
standards were lowered.

113
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,780
That if you wanted to buy a
house, all of a sudden you

114
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,570
could actually find someone who
was willing to give you a

115
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:13,760
house for 10% down, maybe kind
of a steady job, maybe just

116
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,910
need a job.

117
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,000
And maybe you had a
600 credit rating.

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,650
So what happens when the
standards on the mortgage go

119
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,820
from this to this?

120
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,900
Let's go back to these people
who used to rent that house

121
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,510
from us for $900.

122
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,640
Maybe they didn't have
$15,000, right?

123
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,510
That would have been
a 25% down payment.

124
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,450
But maybe back then,
they had 10%.

125
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,810
Maybe they had $6,000.

126
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,430
They just couldn't get up
to $15,000 in savings.

127
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,840
Back when they were doing this,
back in the '80s, if the

128
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,750
standards got a little bit
freer, like they did in the

129
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,390
early 2000s, those people could
have bought a house.

130
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,540
They would have said, man, we
don't have to rent anymore.

131
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,640
We saved up the 10%
down payment.

132
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,490
It's gotten a little easier.

133
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,300
Our job now meets the
requirements.

134
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,820
Our credit now meets
the requirements.

135
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,250
We can go buy that house.

136
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,720
So that would have
increased the

137
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,820
aggregate demand for housing.

138
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,270
Even though, even if no one's
incomes increased, even if the

139
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,570
population didn't increase.

140
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,370
All of a sudden, there's a new
person who could get financing

141
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,390
to buy a house.

142
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,400
And then if we go to,
let's say, 2003.

143
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,290
They say, you know what,
you don't even

144
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,410
need any down payment.

145
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,740
No down.

146
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,260
No money down.

147
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,200
So you can imagine, there's a
whole set of people who maybe

148
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,490
had a decent income, but they
couldn't save any money.

149
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,330
Now all of a sudden there was
no down payment barrier to

150
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,230
buying a house.

151
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,785
Maybe you still needed a job.

152
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:38,340
And maybe you just needed
a 500 credit.

153
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,880
Right?

154
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,950
So all of a sudden, without
people's incomes going up,

155
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,000
without more jobs being
available, without the

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,230
population increase, there
were more people

157
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,870
who could get financing.

158
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,200
Or more people who could
bid up homes.

159
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,010
And the situation actually
got pretty bad.

160
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,410
By 2004, 2005 -- and this isn't
exact, but it gives you

161
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,010
a sense of what happened.

162
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,160
By 2004, 2005, you had a
situation where they had these

163
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,700
stated income -- they had these

164
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,930
things called liar loans.

165
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,610
Maybe I'll do videos
on each of these.

166
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,530
But these were essentially
no down payment.

167
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,260
If you had a job, you could
kind of make it up.

168
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,030
You just said, I have a job.

169
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,060
They wouldn't validate it.

170
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,140
These were stated income.

171
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,970
You could just say
what you made.

172
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,530
So even though the mortgage
might require an income of

173
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,140
$10,000 a month, and your income
is only $2,000 a month,

174
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,300
you could say your income
is $10,000 a month.

175
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,065
So stated income, no
down, maybe a job.

176
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:35,260
And they didn't even
do a credit check.

177
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,660
So what happened from 2000 to
2004 is that credit just got

178
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,320
easier and easier and easier.

179
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,650
And every time credit got
easier, there were more people

180
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,620
who, despite the fact that they
weren't making any more

181
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,140
money, they were able
to get financing.

182
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,560
And so the pool of people who
were able to bid on homes, or

183
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,200
the demand for homes because now
there was this financing,

184
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,600
became larger and larger.

185
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,630
And that's what increased
the prices of homes.

186
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,510
And now you know, the obvious
question is, well, why did

187
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,290
this happen?

188
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,170
First of all, why did they get
easier in 2001, get easier and

189
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,510
easier as we went to 2004?

190
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,510
And why did they get to this
unbelievably absurd level,

191
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,260
where by 2004 and 2005 -- you
hear stories, especially in

192
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,310
California and Florida, of
people who were making maybe

193
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,560
$40,000 a year.

194
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,530
And they were able to buy houses
with no money down.

195
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,560
Some of these people were
migrant laborers.

196
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,260
And they were able to buy
houses for $1 million.

197
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,480
So in the next video, I will
tell you why that happened.

198
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,630
Why were people willing to give
their cash to people to

199
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,480
buy a house that had a very low
likelihood of getting paid

200
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,200
back, and for a house that had a
very low likelihood of being

201
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,750
able to retain its value.

202
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,870
I'll see you in the
next video.

203
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,000
