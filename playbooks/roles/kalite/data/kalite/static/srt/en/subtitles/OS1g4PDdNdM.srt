00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:08,403
Let's see if we can write 0.36 as a fraction.

2
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:11,376
There are several ways of doing it. The way I like to do it is to say, well,

3
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:18,205
0.36, this is the same thing as 36 hundredths. Or, one way to think about it is,

4
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:23,556
This is in the hundredths place..

5
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:30,999
This is in the tenths place, or you could view this as 30 hundredths. You can view this as 3 tenths or 30 hundredths.

6
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:38,669
So we could say that this is the same thing as 36 hundredths or this is equal to "36 over 100."

7
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:46,538
We've already expressed it as a fraction, but now we can actually simplify it, because both 36 and 100 have some common factors.

8
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:58,674
They are both divisible by 4, so if we could divide the numerator by 4, and the denominator by 4 (we're doing the same thing to both, so we're not changing the value of the fraction),

9
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:04,342
36 divided by 4 is 9. And then 100 divided by 4 is 25.

10
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:07,987
And now these two characters don't seem to share any other common factors,

11
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:12,925
so we've written it in simplified form. And we're done.
