1
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:07,690
So today we’re going to talk about a topic that’s very central to the idea of evolution and that’s natural selection.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,568
   

3
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:11,770
But before we get into that I want to talk about what evolution isn’t.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,187
Evolution isn’t when some organism like this monkey magically transforms into a human.

5
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:20,520
And it’s also not when an organism changes in some way when it’s in trouble,

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,769
like a person growing wings after jumping off a building. And I want to clarify that

7
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:28,171
this is not what we are referring to when we think of evolution.

8
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:33,270
Evolution is a process that occurs to populations of an organism not individual members

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,304
and it occurs over huge amounts of time, we’re talking millions and millions of years for even small changes.

10
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:47,639
So, natural selection is one of the forces that ultimately drives evolution, but what is natural selection exactly?

11
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:52,472
Well, why don’t we jump right in and look at an example? Let’s say it’s 10,000 years ago

12
00:00:52,472 --> 00:00:58,405
and people survive by hunting and gathering but they also have to worry about, you know, being chased around by wild animals.

13
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:01,003
So in order to survive, these people need to be able to find food,

14
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:04,239
but they also need to be able to escape from predators.

15
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:11,187
Well let’s say that one of the people of these two has a special genetic trait and has slightly longer legs than the other guy.

16
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:14,518
Now these longer legs put him at an advantage because his legs

17
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:18,273
are longer and he can run 2 times as fast as everyone else.

18
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:23,438
Now because of this, he’s more likely to survive when a predator, like this bear, chases him down.

19
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:29,186
What this also means is that the guy with the long legs is more likely to reach an age where he’s old enough

20
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:36,770
to find a mate, reproduce, and have children, who would also have this special trait of longer legs because it’s genetic.

21
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:45,103
And because he’s more likely to have kids than everyone else, over long periods of time soon more and more of the population will have this special trait.

22
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:50,687
Now let’s look at this idea again but a little more deeply. Let’s say there are 6 people in the world and

23
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:57,237
2 of them have longer legs than everyone else. And let’s say the ones with the longer legs have a 50% chance of surviving and reproducing,

24
00:01:57,237 --> 00:02:03,670
while the shorter legged people have only a 25% chance of surviving and reproducing.

25
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,518
That means one of our two long-legged people and one of our four short-legged people here will reach an age where they can reproduce.

26
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:15,905
So now these people who survived will each have four children and naturally these children will resemble their parents.

27
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:19,138
And the children of long-legged people will also have long legs

28
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:22,020
and the children of short-legged people will have short legs.

29
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,519
So now in our next generation we have four people with long legs and four with short legs.

30
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,005
And you can already see that more of the population has long legs than when we started.

31
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:35,804
But let’s take it another generation further. So half of our long-legged people will reproduce

32
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:39,020
whereas only one quarter of our short legged people will reproduce.

33
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:45,602
And this means that by our third generation we will have eight long-legged kids and only four short-legged ones.

34
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:55,770
Now if we number our generations Generations One, Two, and Three—we can see that in Generation One, 33% of the population was long-legged,

35
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:04,836
in Generation Two, 50% of the population was long-legged, and by Generation Three—67% of our population was long-legged.

36
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:09,470
And this is all because that special trait of having longer legs made those people

37
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:15,687
more likely to survive and reproduce than those with short legs. And this is the crux of how natural selections works.

38
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:20,019
So, why is it called natural selection in the first place?

39
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,187
Well, let’s stay with our example of short and long legged people.

40
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:27,936
Now we use the word selection because one trait is advantageous over another and

41
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:32,438
is “selected to be passed on” to future generations more than other traits.

42
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:37,187
On the other hand, selection can also apply to a disadvantageous trait.

43
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:40,687
If we have people who have really short legs and run really slowly

44
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:46,070
then those people will be selected against and won’t pass on traits to offspring as frequently.

45
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:51,069
Now we use the word "natural" because there isn’t an individual who is physically selecting

46
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:56,806
which traits are good and which ones are bad. It all has to do with who has the greatest probability of surviving.

47
00:03:56,806 --> 00:04:00,737
There’s no one actually doing the selecting except nature itself.

48
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:08,020
Now finally I just want to point out that natural selection does not apply to acquired characteristics.

49
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,270
You know if a father teaches his son how to hunt and this makes the child more likely to survive;

50
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:19,603
you know, that isn’t a trait that is selected for since it’s not genetic and it’s not absolutely passed on to children.

51
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:23,686
So that’s why we say that natural selection only applies to heritable traits,

52
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:27,902
with heritable traits being any genetic trait.

53
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,127
So, what did we learn?

54
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:32,805
Well, first we learned about the concept of natural selection

55
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:37,687
and how traits that help an organism survive are more likely to get passed on to offspring.

56
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:41,019
Next, we learned that evolution, which is driven by natural selection,

57
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:46,669
occurs to populations not individuals and occurs over a huge period of time.

58
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:51,854
And finally, we learned that natural selection only applies to heritable traits,

59
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:55,686
ones that are genetic and passed down from generation to generation.
