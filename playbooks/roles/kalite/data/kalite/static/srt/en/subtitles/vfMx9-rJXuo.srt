1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,949
If we have 2 groups and in each group I have 4,

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:06,364
(so that's one group of 4)

3
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:09,708
(and then here is my second group of 4)

4
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:20,100
we already know that we could write this as 2 times 4

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,008
which is the same thing as 4 plus 4.

6
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:31,024
Notice, I have 2 fours here. I have 4 plus another 4,

7
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:33,346
which is going to be equal to...

8
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:40,100
Well if I have 4 plus 4 or if I have 2 groups of 4, either way I'm going to have a total of 8 things.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,705
And you see that right over here.

10
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:47,371
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 things.

11
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:53,268
What I want you to do is pause the video now and try to group these same 8 things

12
00:00:53,268 --> 00:00:58,005
but to group it in other way, so that we can represent 8 as the product of whole number.

13
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:04,368
Here I've represented 8 as the product of 2 and 4.
2 times 4 is 8.

14
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:08,367
See if you can represent 8 as a product of other whole numbers or

15
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:13,284
whole numbers in different ways. Grouping it in different ways.

16
00:01:13,284 --> 00:01:17,371
So I assume you've paused the video so let's try it out ourselves.

17
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:24,197
So one thing we could do, we could view this instead of 2 groups of 4 we can view 8 as 4 groups of 2.

18
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:31,833
So that's one group of 2, two groups of 2, three groups of 2, four groups of 2.

19
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:42,030
So we could write that 4 times 2 is equal to 8.

20
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,699
And we could view this is the same thing as literally 4 twos.

21
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:48,625
We have 1, 2, 3, 4 twos.

22
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,668
Each of these have 2 in them so we're going to say:

23
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:55,266
1, 2, 3, 4 twos.

24
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:58,702
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 is equal to 8.

25
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:04,368
These are both equivalent. 4 times 2, literally 4 groups of 2.

26
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:09,708
That's the same thing as taking 4 twos and adding them together.

27
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:14,353
Notice, we have 2 twos right over here, we added them together: 1, 2.

28
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:18,950
Here we have 4 twos and we're adding them together: 1, 2, 3, 4.

29
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,690
We take our 4 twos and we add them together.

30
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,034
How else we could we represent 8?

31
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,702
Well, we literally could view it as 8 groups of 1.

32
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:31,953
So let's do that. So 8 groups of 1 would look like this:

33
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:41,009
That's 1 group of one, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

34
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:45,833
So we could write this down as 8 times 1.

35
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:51,367
8 times 1 is (once again) equal to 8.

36
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:55,266
And if we wanted to write this down as a repeated addition, well this is literally 8 ones.

37
00:02:55,266 --> 00:03:16,025
So 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 (let's see... that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) plus 1 plus 1 is equal to 8.

38
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:19,433
Now you might be a little stomp.
Well what's another way of getting to 8?

39
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:25,367
Well, you could literally view it as 1 group of 8.

40
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:26,706
So let me view it that way.

41
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:31,536
So this is just one entire group of 8, the whole thing!

42
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:35,204
The whole thing is a group of 8.

43
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:44,632
So we could write this down as 1 (let me scroll over to the right a little bit) times 8.

44
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:49,276
And 1 times 8 is equal to 8.

45
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:50,948
And how would we view that?

46
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:53,270
Well, we only have one 8 now.

47
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,381
We don't have to add that one 8 to anything else so we could literally write this down.

48
00:03:56,381 --> 00:04:00,050
If we wanted to do it the way we've done the last few, we could literally write it down.

49
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,954
We just have one 8!

50
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:07,201
Well, one 8 is clearly going to just be equal to 8.

51
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:09,709
So now let me ask you another question.

52
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:16,628
So far we've been focused on each of these groups, but what if we actually view this as 4 groups of 8?

53
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:26,195
So what if we actually view this (let me clear this) as 4 groups of 8?

54
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:28,471
Then how many things are we actually going to have?

55
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:30,793
So let me make this very clear.

56
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:41,010
So we have one group of 8, two groups of 8, three groups of 8 and four groups of 8.

57
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:49,276
So we would view this as 4 times 8.

58
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:57,264
Or, which is going to be the same thing, as 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 8.

59
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:00,468
Four 8s. What is this going to be equal to?

60
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:03,951
And I encourage you to pause the video and figure it out right now.

61
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:06,598
Well, there's a couple of ways that you could've thought about this.

62
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,033
You could've literally just counted these or you could say:

63
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:16,367
Well, let's see. You could skip count by eight: 8, 16, 24, 32.

64
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:24,013
Or you could've said: 8 plus 8 is 16, plus 8 is 24, plus 8 is 32.

65
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:28,013
Or you could've literally just counted all the triangles here.
