1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
   

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,180
Let's say that you're in
desperate need of money and I

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,070
have money to lend
to other people.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,820
So this is me and this
is my gold chain.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,760
So you come to me and say,
Sal, I need $10,000 for a

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,240
kidney transplant.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,270
Can you lend me the money?

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,520
I'm in desperate need.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,780
   

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,530
And I have $10,000.

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,650
Sure, I'm willing to lend it
to you, but it's a tough

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,770
economy and you never know where
that money's going to go

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,130
and I don't know if you're going
to be able to keep your

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,970
job after going through this
kidney surgery and all that.

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,080
So I'm very careful with my
money so I want to make sure

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,900
that you're good for it.

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,700
So we think about it a little
bit and I say, hey, that watch

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,040
you have on your wrist, that
looks pretty nice.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,550
You say, this watch?

20
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,800
Let me draw the watch.

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,430
   

22
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,680
And I say, yeah, that watch.

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,150
You're like, this watch
I got from my

24
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,440
great-great-grandfather and it's
actually worth-- I don't

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,310
know-- maybe it's a diamond
studded Rolex of some sort and

26
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,330
it's actually worth
$30,000, right?

27
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,660
And I know that, clearly because
I've already become

28
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,260
well acquainted with gold and
diamonds and things like that.

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,300
So I say, I trust you and
you trust yourself.

30
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,200
I'll lend you the $10,000, but
just so that we all know that

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,370
everything's going to be fine,
why don't you just leave your

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,360
great-grandfather's
watch with me?

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,600
And when you pay back the
$10,000 with a low interest--

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:43,320
let's say it's 10% a week-- when
you pay back the money,

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,490
the principal, with the
interest, however long you

36
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,650
borrow it, I'll give you
back your watch.

37
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,600
You're like, I don't
know about that.

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,440
First of all, 10% a week
sounds like a lot.

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,210
I was like, well, don't you just
need it for the kidney

40
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,330
transplant tomorrow and then you
can work a couple of weeks

41
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,030
and then pay it back.

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,550
10% a week's not bad-- and we
all know that that is because

43
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,520
you compound that over the year
and it becomes some type

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,120
of horrendous interest rate.

45
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,160
But you're desperate.

46
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,250
You need your kidney and I'm
like, look, you plan on paying

47
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,150
me back, right?

48
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,650
So you're going to get your
$30,000 watch back, so what's

49
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,090
there to worry, right?

50
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,460
So why don't you just leave this
with me as collateral?

51
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,220
And you say, fine and you leave
your watch and you get

52
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,340
your kidney transplant and then
you try to work really

53
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,230
hard to pay it back,
but you never can

54
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,280
and I keep your watch.

55
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,950
And this is how the pawn process
essentially works.

56
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,760
You've pawned your watch off to
me, but in a less kind of

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
derisive way of talking about
it, you've given it as

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,630
collateral for a loan.

59
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,600
And I was willing to give you
the loan because I knew that

60
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,470
if you couldn't pay it back, I
could keep this nice asset.

61
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,430
And this happens all the
time in less shady

62
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,790
parts of our economy.

63
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,030
A bank will give you a loan and
they'll collateralize it

64
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,600
by the house.

65
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,820
If you can't pay the loan,
they keep the house.

66
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,630
They want you to put a down
payment on the house so that

67
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,400
even if the house devalues, they
still capture back most

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,750
of their money.

69
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,500
And so this is a pretty
straightforward

70
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,430
collateralized loan.

71
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,090
This is the collateral
you give me.

72
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,820
I give you the loan.

73
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,390
You pay it back.

74
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,190
I give you back the
collateral.

75
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,050
Now what if there was a reality
where I don't-- me as

76
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,890
the lender, I don't even like
this notion of collateral and

77
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,660
all of that.

78
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,970
I actually want to make it
very clear that I have

79
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,640
ownership of the collateral
when it happens, right?

80
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,480
I don't want some Feds coming
in and saying, wow, whose

81
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,620
watch is this that
you're holding?

82
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,710
Where's the receipt for this?

83
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,300
Where did you get it?

84
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,060
Was it stolen from somebody?

85
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,450
And it looks all shady and I
probably do have some side

86
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,020
shady operations anyway so I
want to know that I own this

87
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,050
watch in the event that
you don't come

88
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,840
back to pay the loan.

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,310
So instead, we could have done
this exact same transaction--

90
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,290
so this is you again.

91
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,330
This is me again.

92
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,490
I'll draw that top hat
and the moustache.

93
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,410
Those are my differentiating
characteristics, maybe the

94
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,230
gold chain.

95
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,850
And now what I can do is--
because I want ownership of

96
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,130
that watch, what I'll do is I
will buy that watch from you.

97
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,730
So you'll give the watch-- so
the watch will literally

98
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,930
change hands.

99
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:21,279
So I will buy the watch
from you for $10,000.

100
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,940
But we'll also have
a side agreement.

101
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,850
So far it's almost
identical, right?

102
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,370
The only difference between this
and what we did before

103
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,050
is, I'm actually selling
the money.

104
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,590
I'm actually buying the
watch from you.

105
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,370
This is a cash transaction.

106
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,600
This wasn't a loan, strictly
speaking, but the same thing

107
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,450
is happening, right?

108
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,070
Up here you handed
me the watch and

109
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,380
I handed you $10,000.

110
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,940
Here, you handed me the watch
and I handed you $10,000.

111
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,450
But what we'll add on to this
is an agreement that at some

112
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,510
future date-- so this is now.

113
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,970
   

114
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,620
We also going to have an
agreement-- and both of us are

115
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:05,820
parties to this-- that in the
future, I will agree to sell

116
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,040
and you will agree to buy this
watch for me for something

117
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,390
more than $10,000.

118
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,570
So in the future, you're going
to give me back my money.

119
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:21,550
So it'll be $10,000 plus
something-- and that's

120
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,130
something is essentially
interest, right?

121
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,170
So I'll get my money back
and then I'll give

122
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,890
you back the watch.

123
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,060
So if you think about it, this
is completely identical

124
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,210
economically to what we
did up here, right?

125
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,930
I gave you $10,000.

126
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,880
You gave me the watch
as collateral.

127
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,190
When you pay back the $10,000
plus interest, I give you back

128
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,130
the watch, right?

129
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,220
But at no time did I really
have real, legitimate

130
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,590
ownership of that watch.

131
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,370
Well, in this situation,
the same thing happens.

132
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,330
You come to me.

133
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,450
I give you money.

134
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,570
You give me the watch, but I
bought it from you so I have a

135
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,760
receipt too.

136
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,650
I am the official owner of the
watch while you have my money,

137
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,990
but we have an agreement that at
some future date, you will

138
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,300
repurchase the watch from me.

139
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,350
   

140
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,200
for $10,000 plus some amount,
which is essentially the

141
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,310
interest. So this was a loan
collateralized by a watch, but

142
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,460
the only difference here is that
instead of it just being

143
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,620
collateral, you actually sold
it to me and then we had a

144
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,620
repurchase agreement-- and it
took me six minutes to say

145
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:45,480
that, but I think it was worth
it-- where you agree to

146
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,910
repurchase the watch
at some point.

147
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,270
It's actually I'm the holder of
the repurchase agreement.

148
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,590
So the money lender-- so
I get the watch and

149
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,070
a repurchase agreement.

150
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,470
We'll call that a repo.

151
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,530
So these are two assets that I
now have-- the watch plus the

152
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,650
repurchase agreement.

153
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,665
You get the money.

154
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:08,460
And it's actually called
a reverse repo, from

155
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,710
your point of view.

156
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,130
   

157
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,290
But the whole idea here is this
agreement forces you to

158
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,030
buy the watch back at the
original amount that you

159
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:26,080
essentially borrowed from me
plus some interest. And this

160
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,890
essentially forces me
to sell it to you.

161
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,320
So we have a-- it's

162
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,060
essentially a forward contract.

163
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,750
A forward contract is just an
agreement to transact in the

164
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,900
future at some given price.

165
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,300
And the whole reason why I did
this is because this is how

166
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,900
the Fed transacts.

167
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,600
This is how the Fed lends,
especially with

168
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,520
the discount window.

169
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,600
Sometimes it's called a
repo transaction or

170
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,060
a repurchase agreement.

171
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,340
And so what the Fed does when
someone comes to it at the

172
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,180
discount window-- let me
actually draw proper balance

173
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,660
sheets now.

174
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,320
Let's say that this over
here is a bank in need.

175
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,300
I won't worry about the
right-hand side of the balance

176
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,830
sheet too much.

177
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,640
It has some liabilities,
some equities.

178
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,780
Let's say it has a
ton of assets.

179
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,580
Let's say that these right
here are treasuries.

180
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,330
But it's all out
of cash, right?

181
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,810
This is the bank.

182
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,390
It's all out of cash and on the
other hand, we have the

183
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,470
Federal reserve.

184
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,425
Let me see if I can draw their
balance sheet properly.

185
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:36,409
And the Federal reserve-- well,
for the most part, these

186
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,669
are going to be treasuries
right now.

187
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,659
It has some liabilities.

188
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,740
I won't go into that just yet.

189
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,660
It has some equity.

190
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,270
And let's say you're one
of these pariah banks.

191
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,440
No-one's willing
to lend to you.

192
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,580
Your depositors are taking
out their money.

193
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,730
So you need to convert some of
these treasuries into cash.

194
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,390
You don't want to just dump
them on the market.

195
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,270
Maybe there are other assets
that are less liquid and if

196
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,360
you just dump them, you won't
get the value you want.

197
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,910
So essentially you enter into
a repurchase agreement with

198
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,860
the Federal reserve.

199
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,400
So this is the Fed reserve.

200
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,420
You go to the Federal reserve
discount window.

201
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,400
The discount rate might be-- I
don't know-- 5% on an annual

202
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,770
basis, but we won't get into
the technicalities of that.

203
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,090
You say, hey, Fed, lend
me some money.

204
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,080
And the Fed says, OK, let me
print some money for you.

205
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,980
So these are the liabilities
notes outstanding and then he

206
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,680
prints some Federal reserve
notes, but instead of just

207
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,940
lending the money to you and
then keeping these treasuries

208
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,450
as collateral, the Federal
reserve will actually buy

209
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,610
these-- it'll enter into a
repurchase agreement with you.

210
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,820
So the mechanics of that is that
the Federal reserve will

211
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,030
buy these treasuries from you.

212
00:09:45,030 --> 00:10:02,200
So now all of a sudden, the
treasuries-- the Federal

213
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,060
reserve notes will go from from
the Federal reserve to

214
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,310
you and then your cash will go
to-- then your treasury notes

215
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,770
will go to the Federal
reserve, right?

216
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,130
This is cash-- Federal reserve
printed cash, gave it to you,

217
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,100
and then essentially bought
treasury notes from you.

218
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,160
So now these are
treasury notes.

219
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,560
These are the treasury notes
that were here before.

220
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,300
But it has a repurchase
agreement where you agree at

221
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,500
some future date to unwind this
transaction, where you're

222
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,630
going to buy back your
treasuries and you're going to

223
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,960
pay the amount that the treasury
paid you initially

224
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,490
plus some interest, right?

225
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,920
So the basic way to view it
is, this was just a loan.

226
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,630
You just borrowed this much
from the Federal reserve.

227
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,780
The Federal reserve kept your
treasuries as collateral, but

228
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,560
it actually had formal
ownership over it.

229
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,970
And that's what differentiates
a repo agreement from just a

230
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,810
traditional collateralized loan,
but in the future you're

231
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,490
going to buy back those
treasuries for the amount the

232
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,870
Federal reserve had originally
bought them from you for plus

233
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,330
a little bit of interest. You're
going to pay a little

234
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,800
interest and that interest is
going to be dictated by the

235
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,090
discount rate.

236
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,650
Anyway, all out of time.

237
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,590
In the next video, we'll
actually look at the Federal

238
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,780
reserve's balance sheet.

239
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:23,900
