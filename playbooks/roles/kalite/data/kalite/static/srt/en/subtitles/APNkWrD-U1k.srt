1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870
   

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,180
I will now do a proof
of the law of sines.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,920
So, let's see, let me draw
an arbitrary triangle.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,380
That's one side right there.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,510
And then I've got
another side here.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,320
I'll try to make it look a
little strange so you realize

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,410
it can apply to any triangle.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,920
And let's say we know the
following information.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,530
We know this angle -- well,
actually, I'm not going to say

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,940
what we know or don't know, but
the law of sines is just a

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,980
relationship between different
angles and different sides.

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,500
Let's say that this angle
right here is alpha.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,470
This side here is A.

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,490
The length here is A.

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,720
Let's say that this side
here is beta, and that

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,270
the length here is B.

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,185
Beta is just B with
a long end there.

18
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:53,700
So let's see if we can find a
relationship that connects A

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,120
and B, and alpha and beta.

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,300
So what can we do?

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,130
And hopefully that
relationship we find will

22
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,610
be the law of sines.

23
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,390
Otherwise, I would have
to rename this video.

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,980
So let me draw an
altitude here.

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,612
I think that's the proper term.

26
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:15,230
If I just draw a line from this
side coming straight down, and

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,350
it's going to be perpendicular
to this bottom side, which I

28
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,130
haven't labeled, but I'll
probably, if I have to label

29
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,630
it, probably label it C,
because that's A and B.

30
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,780
And this is going to
be a 90 degree angle.

31
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,870
   

32
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,280
I don't know the
length of that.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,480
I don't know anything about it.

34
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,510
All I know is I went from this
vertex and I dropped a line

35
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,550
that's perpendicular
to this other side.

36
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,300
So what can we do
with this line?

37
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,330
Well let me just say
that it has length x.

38
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,320
The length of this line is x.

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,950
Can we find a relationship
between A, the length of

40
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,620
this line x, and beta?

41
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,570
Well, sure.

42
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,670
Let's see.

43
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,790
Let me find an
appropriate color.

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,160
OK.

45
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,290
That's, I think, a good color.

46
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,380
So what's the relationship?

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,730
If we look at this angle right
here, beta, x is opposite to it

48
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,140
and A is the hypotenuse, if we
look at this right triangle

49
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,430
right here, right?

50
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,180
So what deals with
opposite and hypotenuse?

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,100
Whenever we do trigonometry, we
should always just right soh

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,180
cah toa at the top of the page.

53
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,010
Soh cah toa.

54
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,190
So what deals with
opposite of hypotenuse?

55
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,960
Sine, right?

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,820
Soh, and you should probably
guess that, because I'm

57
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,770
proving the law of sines.

58
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:36,490
So the sine of beta is
equal to the opposite

59
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,370
over the hypotenuse.

60
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,130
It's equal to this opposite,
which is x, over the

61
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,440
hypotenuse, which is
A, in this case.

62
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,500
And if we wanted to solve for
x, and I'll just do that,

63
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,160
because it'll be convenient
later, we can multiply both

64
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,550
sides of this equation by A
and you get A sine of

65
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,240
beta is equal to x.

66
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,350
Fair enough.

67
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,100
That got us someplace.

68
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,470
Well, let's see if we
can find a relationship

69
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,680
between alpha, B, and x.

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,170
Well, similarly, if we look at
this right triangle, because

71
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,730
this is also a right triangle,
of course, x here, relative to

72
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,330
alpha, is also the opposite
side, and B now is

73
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:16,945
the hypotenuse.

74
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:22,560
So we can also write that sine
of alpha -- let me do it in a

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,270
different color -- is equal
to opposite over hypotenuse.

76
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,840
   

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,995
The opposite is x and
the hypotenuse is B.

78
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:40,530
   

79
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,900
And let's solve for x
again, just to do it.

80
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,910
Multiply both sides by B
and you get B sine of

81
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,280
alpha is equal to x.

82
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,130
So now what do we have?

83
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,080
We have two different ways that
we solved for this thing that I

84
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,890
dropped down from this
side, this x, right?

85
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,770
We have A sine of
beta is equal to x.

86
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,180
And then B sine of
alpha is equal to x.

87
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,120
Well, if they're both equal
to x, then they're both

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,390
equal to each other.

89
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,060
So let me write that down.

90
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,060
Let me write that down
in a soothing color.

91
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:21,520
So we know that A sine of beta
is equal to x, which is also

92
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,900
equal to B sine of beta --
sorry, B sine of alpha.

93
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,160
   

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,280
If we divide both sides of this
equation by A, what do we get?

95
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,600
We get sine of beta, right,
because the A on this side

96
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,360
cancels out, is equal to
B sine of alpha over A.

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,790
And if we divide both sides of
this equation by B, we get

98
00:04:47,790 --> 00:05:04,920
sine of beta over B is equal
to sine of alpha over A.

99
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,880
So this is the law of sines.

100
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,280
The ratio between the sine of
beta and its opposite side --

101
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,550
and it's the side that it
corresponds to, this B -- is

102
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,670
equal to the ratio of the sine
of alpha and its opposite side.

103
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,200
And a lot of times in the
books, let's say, if this angle

104
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,430
was theta, and this was C, then
they would also write that's

105
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,560
also equal to the sine
of theta over C.

106
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,130
And the proof of adding
this here is identical.

107
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,380
We've picked B arbitrarily, B
as a side, we could have done

108
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,830
the exact same thing with theta
and C, but instead of dropping

109
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,350
the altitude here, we would
have had to drop one of

110
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,160
the other altitudes.

111
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,800
And I think you could
figure out that part.

112
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,530
But the important thing
is we have this ratio.

113
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,800
And of course, you could have
written it -- since it's a

114
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,920
ratio, you could flip both
sides of the ratio -- you could

115
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,730
write it B over the sine of B
is equal to A over

116
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,480
the sine of alpha.

117
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,740
And this is useful, because if
you know one side and its

118
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,640
corresponding angle, the angle
opposite it that kind of opens

119
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,680
up into that side, and say you
know the other side, then you

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,640
could figure out the angle
that opens up into it.

121
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,370
If you know three of these
things, you can figure

122
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:21,960
out the fourth.

123
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,100
And that's what's useful
about the law of sines.

124
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,490
So maybe now I will do a few
law of sines word problems.

125
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,450
I'll see you in the next video.

126
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,000
