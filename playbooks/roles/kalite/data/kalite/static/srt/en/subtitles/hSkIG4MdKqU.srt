1
00:00:02,142 --> 00:00:06,607
Let's talk about capillaries. There are actually three different major types of capillaries

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:14,144
I'm gonna just kind of sketch out all three. I've started with the continuous one. I've drew out to save us a little bit of time

3
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:19,369
and the continuous capillaries is the one that you see the most commonly throughout the body.

4
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:24,576
That's why I'll start with this one. Couple of things you'll notice, you'll see that there are 4 nuclei,

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,843
so four cells here, making up the part of the capillary we're looking at. And there's red blood cell moving in right

6
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:36,576
And you actually have the cross-section on the right side so you can actually see if we were to cut along that face that I've cut

7
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:41,202
that's what you would actually see. Now there are two specific things that I want to point out.

8
00:00:41,202 --> 00:00:46,702
One is that there's a little gap here between these two cells. I'm sketching it in yellow just to point it out and

9
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:55,535
that gap is called and intercellular,because it's between cells, intercellular cleft.

10
00:00:55,535 --> 00:01:02,700
So the intercellular cleft is that yellow streak that I just drew. And if was to point it out on that cross-section here

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,410
it would be right here. You can see a little hole between the two where they don't really meet up.

12
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:12,035
Now there are two more spots I want to point out. One right there and one right there in yellow. And they correspond to

13
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:22,009
this spot and this spot. And there there is really nice joining between the two cells and we call them tight junctions.

14
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:27,367
Kind of a good name for it as you can kind of see why they are called that. And those tight junctions are

15
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:34,975
right there, labelled with my yellow arrows. Now one thing I haven't drawn, I'm gonna sketch out right here is in green

16
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:43,243
and this kind of is a layer beneath all these cells. These cells make up the wall of the capillary but behind them

17
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:48,309
so that the blood doesn't actually see this layer, except for at the intercellular cleft,

18
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:56,909
is a layer called the basement membrane. So this green stuff that I'm drawing for you is the basement membrane.

19
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,275
And this basement membrane basically like a foundation for a house.

20
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:07,173
It's gonna keep our cells kind of grounded and keep them in place. And this layer is largely made up of proteins

21
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:12,442
Let me now show you a second drawing that I did. This is our second type of capillary.

22
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:17,509
This is a fenestrated capillary. You can see the major difference between the first one and this one

23
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:24,109
is that the second one has little holes that will call fenestrations. Fenestrations

24
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:29,941
So this is a fenestrated capillary. And these pores. I'm gonna just label them.

25
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:34,576
You can also call them pores or holes. These pores are all over the capillary.

26
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:41,074
So we still have, just as before, four cells, four nuclei and one little red blood cell poking its way through.

27
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:47,810
And you still have the intercellular cleft. So, just to show you where it is on this one, it's right there

28
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,909
where the two cells really don't meet up so nicely. There's a little gap

29
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,109
there. And as before there is a basement membrane. So I'm just gonna sketch out the basement membrane

30
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:03,274
all the way around. And on this cross section you can see now how I've tried to draw the best I can to show

31
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:08,509
you the pores but you have to kind of now get a little creative to see where that intercellular cleft is

32
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:14,309
versus where the pores are. So whenever you're looking at the cross-section, it is a little tricky

33
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:19,909
cause you have to almost imagine it in three dimensions. Now the one thing that does help us is that

34
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:25,444
on the inside of these endocellular cells, there is, I'm gonna draw in blue,

35
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:36,509
a little layer, almost like a slime. And this slime layer is called Glycocalyx. Glycocalyx.

36
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:42,575
And what glycocalyx is, is basically sugars that are attached to proteins.

37
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:49,209
This kind of sugary protein mix is all over the inside layer of the endocellular cells

38
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,708
and so what it does is that it actually gets across these pores.

39
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:57,876
And even though there is a pore there, you might get a little glycocalyx expanding in the pore, and it will

40
00:03:57,876 --> 00:04:05,343
come across and look like that. The one place where you won't see it is in the intercellular cleft

41
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:10,110
cause that's actually a real spot between cells. So you have the intercellular cleft

42
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,276
like you do here, let me draw an arrow down there. Right there, you won't see any glycocalyx there

43
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:24,642
So we call that little bit of glycocalyx that's bridging the pore, we call that the diaphragm. Diaphragm.

44
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:34,840
So these cells. So these fenestrated capillaries actually have diaphragm over their pores.

45
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,775
And I'm gonna put a little star next to that because sometimes you can have fenestrated capillaries that do not have this glycocalyx

46
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:47,509
that's covering the inside and they therefore do not have diaphragm.

47
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:49,375
So this is something that is generally true but not always true.

48
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:55,108
So let me show you the third type of capillary. So let me show you this last drawing

49
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:57,242
and this is actually the largest of the capillaries.

50
00:04:57,242 --> 00:05:07,508
And this one we call this a discontinuous, discontinuous capillary

51
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,942
And another name for it, discontinuous capillary, is, sometimes they call it sinusoids

52
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,475
I'm just gonna write that right here as well. Sinusoids.

53
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:17,940
So these ones are often found in the liver, that's kind of the most popular place

54
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,141
sometimes the spleen as well or bone marrow.

55
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:25,940
These ones are actually-few things- are the largest one. So let me make a little list over here.

56
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:35,309
They are very large. And they have a lot more of this intercellular cleft space. Look at all these gaps between the cells right

57
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:40,841
And I'm just going to sketch it in yellow. Just to highlight it but there's a lot of gap here between the cells

58
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:46,376
meaning that these capillaries end up being very leaky. So in addition to being large, they are very leaky

59
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:56,241
And a final thing about these guys is that unlike the other two capillaries that we've just talked about

60
00:05:56,241 --> 00:06:00,524
they have a basement membrane that is often incomplete. So as long as there is a whole area missing just like that

61
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:04,874
you might have some basement membrane right here and here but you can see whole chunks

62
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:08,810
are missing. Basement membrane. And maybe there's a bit of basement membrane right here.

63
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:18,709
So let me write that as a third point. Incomplete, I'm gonna write BM for basement membrane. Incomplete basement membrane

64
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:25,644
So if this is the case, it'll be easier for things to kind of escape, even if you have a little glycocalyx here

65
00:06:25,644 --> 00:06:35,875
Let me draw a layer of glycocalyx on our discontinuous/sinusoid capillary but, even if you have this glycocalyx

66
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:41,742
because of the fact that you have all that intercellular cleft space and you don't have many of the tight junctions,

67
00:06:41,742 --> 00:06:49,709
it's gonna be easier for things to get out. So moving down these three different types you're getting more and more leaky

68
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:54,605
as you go down. So just keep that in mind is that the leakiness of the vessel is increasing

69
00:06:54,605 --> 00:07:00,309
In fact the most leaky is this guy down here, the discontinuous one

70
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:04,604
So think with me for a second. Let's say you're a molecule in here

71
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:10,772
In the capillary. And you want to get out here, into the tissue. What are the ways you can get there?

72
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:15,853
One way would be if you actually just diffuse across. So one way could be diffusion.

73
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:20,354
And that would work really well if you were a molecule of oxygen or carbon dioxide.

74
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:24,977
It usually works well for these molecules. But let's say you're not one of those molecules

75
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:31,209
Let's say you're a larger molecule or charged molecule, how would you get across?

76
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,574
So the second way you could get across could be through a vescicle.

77
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:39,521
Maybe you could get into a vescicle up here in the cell. And the vescicle could transport you from being on the inside,

78
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:49,074
which is where this X is, to where it can actually get deposited on the other side, and of course

79
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:53,102
it would slow up as it makes it way through the basement membrane but that's at least a way of getting past the cell

80
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:57,976
So this is a second approach, maybe a vescicle could carry a molecule through

81
00:07:57,976 --> 00:08:03,939
A third way could be through this intercellular cleft. Again you still have to get across that basement membrane

82
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,434
but at least you can get across the cell by simply going around the cell

83
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:16,935
So maybe that intercellular cleft could be another ticket to freedom. So if you wanna get around, you can go that way

84
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:18,351
that's a third way. So what's that fourth way.

85
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:24,010
Now we have to go down to our second drawing, the fenestrated one.

86
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,908
Here I would suggest maybe just going through-if you were that little X- maybe just going through that pore

87
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:33,934
and you have to plow your way though the glycocalyx if there is some there. But maybe that's another way

88
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:36,141
going through the fenestration.

89
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:43,075
That could be another way across right. So these are four ways for things on the inside to get to the outside

90
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:48,907
and as you look at this list that we made, these four options, you can see then that our idea

91
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:55,409
around leakiness makes sense. Especially when you get down to the discontinuous vessels at the bottom,

92
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:04,142
you've got large gaps between the cells, lots of intercellular clefts, you've got vescicles, that could apply anywhere

93
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:10,643
diffusion can apply anywhere, and you've got fenestration. So really every opportunity for things to get out of the

94
00:09:10,643 --> 00:09:14,643
capillary is available in those discontinuous or sinusoid capillaries
