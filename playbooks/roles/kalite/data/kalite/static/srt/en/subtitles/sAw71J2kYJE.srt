1
00:00:00,358 --> 00:00:04,893
We're asked to subtract.
And we have the problem 68 - 42.

2
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:09,140
And what I want to do here, is 
1) just show you how I would do this problem,

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,516
and then, talk a little bit 
about why it actually works.

4
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:17,533
So if I have 68 - 42, one way to do it – 
and this is probably the most typical way –

5
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,759
is to write the number you're
subtracting from on top,

6
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:24,507
and to write the number that you're 
subtracting from that number below that.

7
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:27,122
So we're going to have 68 - 42.

8
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:30,200
And the thing you really want to think
about – or to make sure you do,

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,277
is to align your numbers according to place.

10
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:35,501
So the 2 is below the 8 –
(They're both in the 1's place.)

11
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:38,732
– and the 4 is below the 6.
(They're both in the 10's place.)

12
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:41,585
And later in this video it should be 
clear – or I'll hopefully make it clear –

13
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:44,144
why that's a good thing to do.

14
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,397
Alright. So then we go to 
the 1's place, and we see an 8.

15
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,738
And from that, we're
going to subtract a 2.

16
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,533
So, 8 - 2 is 6. (8 - 2 = 6)
I'll write that over here.

17
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:54,790
Let me write that over here.

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,359
8-2 is 6.

19
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:02,200
8 - 2 is equal to 6. 
(Repeating: 8 - 2 = 6)

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,604
And then we go to the 10's place.
We have 6 - 4.

21
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:08,667
And since they're in the 10's place, 
this is really 60 - 40.

22
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:15,604
But 6 - 4 is 2.
6 - 4 = 2.

23
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:19,686
And since these are in the 10's place, 
this is really saying 60 - 40 = 20.

24
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:21,850
And I'll make that a little bit clearer in a second.

25
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,815
So we're actually done here.

26
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:26,261
68 - 42 = 26.

27
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:28,143
And you can check that for yourself.

28
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:31,466
If you add 26 + 42,
you should get 68.

29
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:35,959
Or if you subtract 26 from 68
you should get 42.

30
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:39,005
So I encourage you do that in 
your own time after this video –

31
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:46,178
verify that 42 + 26 = 68.

32
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:50,867
And also verify what 68 - 26 is equal to.

33
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,697
And you should see that is equal to 42.

34
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:56,100
So these are two things for 
you to check on your own.

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,133
Now, the last thing I want to do
in this video is just to explain

36
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,667
in a little bit more depth why this actually works.

37
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:05,400
And, at least in my mind, I like to visualize 68 –

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,025
(You won't to have write it out like this –

39
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,348
but it's one way to make sure you
really understand what is going on here.)

40
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:15,324
68 is the same thing as 60 + 8, or 60 and 8.

41
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:17,723
And from that, we're subtracting 42.

42
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:21,348
But 42 is the same thing as 40 + 2.

43
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:25,769
So we're subtracting 40,
and we're subtracting 2.

44
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,200
We're subtracting 42.
We're subtracting 40 and 2.

45
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,194
And so you can view this as 
really two separate problems.

46
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,415
You have, in the 1's place, you have 8 - 2.

47
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:38,200
And that is exactly what we did over here.
You have a 6.

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,267
And then in 10's place,
you have 60 - 40, which is 20.

49
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:46,867
So you end up with 20 + 6.

50
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:53,105
and you know that that is 
the same exact thing as 26.
