00:00:00,372 --> 00:00:03,906
What I want to do in this video is simplify this expression

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:06,845
3 times the principal root of 500 times "X to the third"

3
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:11,190
and take it into consideration some of the comments that we got out on YouTube that actually

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,282
uh, gave some interesting perspective on how you can simplify this.

5
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:21,146
So this is a quick review of what we did in the last video, we said that this is the same thing as 3 times

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:25,797
the principal root of 500, and I'm gonna do it a little bit different than I did in the last video, just, just

7
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:27,491
so to make it interesting.

8
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:33,210
This is 3 times the principal root of 500 times the principal root of "X to the third."

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:42,181
And, 500, we can rewrite, because 500 is not a perfect square, we can rewrite 500 as 100 times

10
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:47,436
5. Or even better, we can rewrite that as 10 squared times 5... 10 squared is the same thing as 100.

11
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:55,779
So we can rewrite this first part over here 3 times the principal root of 10 squared times 5,

12
00:00:55,779 --> 00:01:03,033
times, times the principal root of x squared times x.

13
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,774
That's the same thing as x to the third.

14
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:08,327
Now the one thing I'm gonna do here... actually I won't talk about it just yet, of how we are gonna

15
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:10,051
do it differently in the last video.

16
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:12,596
This radical, right here, can be rewritten as...

17
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:17,477
So this is gonna be three times the square root, or the principal root, I should say, of 10 squared times...

18
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:20,361
the square root of 5.

19
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:24,513
If we take the square root of the product of two things, it's the same thing as taking the square root of each of...

20
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:26,644
them, and then taking the product.

21
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:32,412
And, so in this over here is going to be times the square root of where the principal root of x squared times...

22
00:01:32,412 --> 00:01:35,992
the principal root of "X."

23
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:43,180
And, the principal root of 10 squared is 10, and then what I said in the last video was the principal root...

24
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,716
of "X" squared is going to be the absolute value of "X."

25
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:50,814
Just in case, just in case, if "X" itself is a negative number.

26
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:56,777
So, then if you simplify all this, you get 3 times 10, which is 30 times, and I'm just gonna switch...

27
00:01:56,777 --> 00:02:01,883
the order here, times the absolute value of X, and then you have this square root of 5,

28
00:02:01,883 --> 00:02:05,530
or the principal root of 5, times the principal root of X.

29
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,898
And this is just going to be equal to the principal root of 5x.

30
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:13,511
Taking the square root of something, and multiplying that times the square root of something else...

31
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,650
is the same thing as just to taking the square root of 5x.

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,148
So, all of this simplified down to 30 times the absolute value of X, times the principal root of...

33
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:23,045
5x.

34
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:24,459
And this is what we got in the last video.

35
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,463
And the interesting thing here is, if we assume we're only dealing with real numbers, the domain...

36
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:36,407
of X, right over here, the X's that will make this expression define in the real numbers...

37
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:41,830
then, X has to be, greater than or equal to 0.

38
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,783
So, let me, so maybe I could write it this way.

39
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:58,643
The domain, here, is that X is any real number, greater than or equal to 0.

40
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:03,863
The reason why I said that is that you put a negative number in here, and you cube it, you're...

41
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:05,464
gonna get another negative number.

42
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:13,229
And, then it doesn't make it, at least in the real numbers, you won't get an actual value.

43
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,367
You'll get a square root of a negative number.

44
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:19,745
So, if you make this, if you assume this right here, we're dealing with the real numbers...

45
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:24,808
we're not dealing with any complex numbers, when you hope their not complex numbers, then...

46
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:28,416
you can have a, you can expand the domain more broadly.

47
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,461
If you're dealing with real numbers, you can say that X is going to be greater than or equal to...

48
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:33,429
0.

49
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:36,645
And, then, the absolute value of X is just going to be X, 'cause it's not going to be...

50
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:38,041
a negative number.

51
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:44,472
And, if, so assuming that the domain of X is, er, if this expression is going to be invaluable, or it's...

52
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:50,280
it's going to have a positive number, that this can be written as 30X times the square root of...

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,551
... of 5X.

54
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:57,050
If you had the situation, where we're dealing with complex numbers, then you would...

55
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,582
So numbers that were, and if you don't know what a complex number is, or an imaginary number, don't...

56
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:03,167
worry too much about it.

57
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:07,433
But, if you were dealing with those, then you would have to keep the absolute value of X...

58
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:11,433
there, because then this would be defined for numbers that are less than 0.
