99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Part c, find the particular solution W as a function of t

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the differential equation dW/d is equal to

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1/25(W-300)

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with initial condition W(0) = 1400

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the units in this problem was 1400 tons

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they told us, 1400 tons

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it might seem strange to see a

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
differential equations problem on an AP exam

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you say "What, this isn't fair! This isn't a differential equations class!"

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the thing to keep in mind is that
