1
00:00:00,163 --> 00:00:09,599
Before jumping into the details of the Bay of Pigs invasion I want to make sure we understand the environment in Cuba and the United States leading up to the invasion.

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,007
So, going into the late 1950s Cuba was controlled by this guy right over here: Batista

3
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,837
and he was a dictator that was supported by the United States.

4
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:25,583
Just to give a sense of what he was like. Here's a quote from John F Kennedy in 1963.

5
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:32,179
So this is after his already had oil the Bay of Pigs has happened, the Cuban Missle Crisis has happened.

6
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:37,617
He was not a big fan of Fidel Castro. But with that said in hindsight, JFK did say this,

7
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:43,810
this is pretty objective assessment of what Batista was like as the dictator of Cuba.

8
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,723
This is John F Kennedy saying this:

9
00:00:45,723 --> 00:00:47,795
I believe there is no country in the world

10
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:56,133
including any and all countries under colonial domination, where economic colonization, humiliation and exploitation

11
00:00:56,133 --> 00:01:03,825
were worse than in Cuba, in part owing to my country's policies during the Batista regime.

12
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:11,800
To some extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a number of sins on the part of the US.

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:19,026
Now we shall have to pay for those sins. So even JFK in hindsight is saying that Batista

14
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:26,538
was really not the best person and it really was not a good idea for the US to support such a

15
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:30,744
corrupt dictator for so long in Cuba. This is Batista

16
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:35,837
right over here, riding with some US generals in a parade when he was visiting DC. So you can imagine

17
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:44,033
he was not a popular person in control in Cuba and in 1959 you have a successful revolution against him.

18
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:53,215
In 1959 there is a revolution and the revolution is led by this character, Fidel Castro, and

19
00:01:53,215 --> 00:02:03,373
his kind of two right hand men are Raoul Castro and Che Gueverra right over here

20
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:09,610
and they take control of Cuba. They're part of this nationalistic, revolutionary movement. Now the one thing

21
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:16,465
they do do, and they are left-leaning from the beginning, people assume that they're maybe communist or

22
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:24,382
quasi communist. But even from the get go as soon as they take power, they start taking over lands that were owned by,

23
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:31,242
well, one that was private cuban property, some of it that was United states property. Their arguement would

24
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:40,772
probably have been that this was wealth, private property that was ill gotten, that was gotten in the time of Batista,

25
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:48,122
but they did on a broad sweep , so they took over a lot of private land, a lot of private property, which also lead people think

26
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:53,994
hey, this is not just a nationalist revolution but also a communist revolution but you could also imagine

27
00:02:53,994 --> 00:03:03,442
that once they take over there this huge migration of Cubans to the United States and there, it's

28
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:10,479
primarily middle class, upper middle class, educated Cubans who were really afraid of what Fidel Castro

29
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:17,195
was doing in terms of taking over of private land, taking people's properties. so you start having this

30
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:24,260
cuban exile community really focused around Florida and mainly Miami and they're still there.

31
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:35,235
And they're very unhappy with this fidel castro character right over here. So when we fast forward to 1961 JFK beocmes president,

32
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:46,186
He got selected in early 1961. We're now fast forwarding to April 1961 so JFK has only been president for a few months. But you can

33
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:50,400
imagine a lot of levels you have all of these cuban exiles, upper middled class, educated, middle

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,733
class, cuban exiles who hate fidel castro. He's taking over their lands he's turning it into what looks like a left

35
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:04,573
estate. This is all happening within the context of the cold war, the US is afraid of

36
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:11,917
countries falling to communism. It looks like fidel castro is a communist, so the US decides the fact

37
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:16,302
that you have all of the exisles who wanna oust him to the US porbably wants to oust him just because

38
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:23,571
he's a communist and they're afraid that he's going to align himself with the soviet union. So in conjunction

39
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:30,344
with the cuban exiles and the cia, and this right here is the director of the central intelligence

40
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:36,215
during the Kennedy administration or at least the beginning part of the Kennedy administration, this is Allan

41
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:44,649
Dulles, his brother is John Foster Dulles, where Dulles airport is named after and he was a US secretary of state.

42
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:51,814
They decide to they want to oust Fidel Castro but they want to do it in a way that the US does

43
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:57,386
not look like the one doing the invasion, so what they do is they plan an invasion where they

44
00:04:57,386 --> 00:05:14,468
take cuban exiles and they get 1400 men to sign up to be kind of part of the CIA backed , US backed force

45
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:21,000
to invade cuba and overthrow fidel castro and a lot of this was based on the premise and you can imagine

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,723
this evenhappened in the iraq war, where the CIA, the American president. They kind of surround themselves with people who tell

47
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:36,733
them, who want give them a very optimistic, hopeful scenario telling them , look we represent what the rest

48
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:42,541
of the cuban people want, they'll say look if we just start a revolution, fidel castro will be over thrown

49
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:48,137
the reality that came out, at least at that point in time, in early 1960s fiedel castro was actually

50
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:52,533
pretty popular with the cuban people and you can imagine he was at that time popular with the poor

51
00:05:52,533 --> 00:06:00,933
people who did not have land and now all of the sudden you have this leader for the people, I don't know

52
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:05,800
about his popularity now but at that point he was propbably much more popular than the exiles and the

53
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,667
cia would have had kennedy believed. so they plan this attack

54
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:15,800
Kennedy says oh, if we can get rid of Fidel Castro then that derisks the possibility of having this

55
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:24,221
communist nation right off of the florda coast. so they plan this invasion and you know it's shady to

56
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:27,959
begin with because they didn't want to make it look like an official american invasion they wanted to

57
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:34,600
make it look like a pure cuban counter-revolution to some degree that really mixed up every thing and

58
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,218
made it look and it really was suspect bcause they really were doing something that was not what it really

59
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:48,854
was. But the invasion the way it all worked out was that by April 15th and this is just going into the

60
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:50,038
details of the day

61
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:51,589
So they had the fourteen hundred exiles

62
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:56,313
They had some ships, some planes they marked them

63
00:06:56,313 --> 00:07:00,554
They either removed the markings so that it didn't look like they were American

64
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,655
ships or planes

65
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:06,322
Or they put false markings of the Cuban military

66
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:08,622
So that it would cause some confusion or whatever

67
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:11,567
So on April 15 1961

68
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:14,795
Remember this is only a few months into Kennedy's administration

69
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:16,904
They start air attacks

70
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:22,994
Which launch from Nicaragua and they go to Cuba

71
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:27,325
And the whole point of these air attacks was to kind of soften the Cuban airforce

72
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:31,476
for an eventual invasion by the 1400 exiles

73
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:40,261
and so they have eight aircraft, eight bombers

74
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:44,759
Leaving Nicaragua they bomb Cuba at a base outside of Havana

75
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,095
and a base near or not too far from the current Guantanamo Bay

76
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,406
and the point or goal is to destroy the Cuban ariforce

77
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,308
It turns out that they didn't do it

78
00:07:55,308 --> 00:08:03,853
They did it to cause confusion, due to the Cuban airforce markings on the planes

79
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:07,685
You had eight planes going and doing the bombing

80
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:10,721
One of them gets shot down

81
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:16,153
and a ninth plane actually leaves from Nicaragua and they falsely put bullet holes

82
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:19,471
in it to make it look like it was hit with anti aircraft guns

83
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:23,407
and had it defect to Florida

84
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:27,070
So I guess the idea behind this was to make it look like there was a Cuban

85
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,937
pilot who takes off from Cuba or somehow gets out of Cuba

86
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:38,902
With a Cuban plane and then tries to destroy a bunch of Cuban aircraft

87
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:41,067
and then defects to the United states

88
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,487
That's the impression that they wanted to create

89
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:46,686
It's not so clear if the Cuban's actually fell for it

90
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:51,071
When that happened in 1961 almost everyone saw it as an American attack

91
00:08:51,071 --> 00:09:00,805
Then you fast forward to the night of April 16th

92
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,985
and this whole time everyone was expecting a US attack

93
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:10,520
This all leads to the fact that this was not a well orchastrated series of events

94
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,353
It's pretty well established that some of these exiles were just not as tightlipped as they should have

95
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:24,787
been about the invasion. It got out to Soviet intelligence so the Cubans knew that an invasion was immenent

96
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:28,020
So on April 16th you have a false or decoy attack

97
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:35,639
right over here, decoy boats with loud speakers on them

98
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,721
that made them sound like they were firing to cause confusion

99
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:41,835
and it did temporarily cause Castro to look in that direction

100
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:46,203
because they were on hair trigger notice expecting an immenent invasion

101
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:50,620
that was not the real one. This was on the evening of April 16th

102
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,703
When you go to the early morning of April 17th you have the real invasion

103
00:09:55,703 --> 00:10:04,387
You have the 1400 Cuban exiles with CIA and US military support (but all of that was hidden )

104
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:08,554
To actually invade at the Bay of Pigs

105
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:15,554
and to make a long story short it was kind of a invasion that did not go well

106
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:23,686
It has been blamed on bad planning, on incompetance at some parts of the invasion

107
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:28,237
If the invasion lasted from April 17th which was the first day of the invasion

108
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:34,086
By April 19th the invading force or counter revolutionary force made up of the 1400 cuban exiles

109
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:37,920
had been pushed back to the beaches

110
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,403
and for the most part a little over 100 of them were killed

111
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:54,913
and over 1000 of them were captured and later executed

112
00:10:54,913 --> 00:11:03,033
and then later on in the year Fidel Castro makes a deal with the United States

113
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:06,120
Where he hands over the captured exiles to the United States in exchange for 58

114
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,585
million dollars in aid and supplies and the rest

115
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:15,070
so this at least from a military point of view was a complete debaucle from the United States point of

116
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,770
view and when you imagine after this happened people in the United States started

117
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,787
pointing fingers

118
00:11:20,787 --> 00:11:27,537
You have the CIA and the exiles blaming the Kennedy administration

119
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:32,486
saying that look he was not willing to do what it takes to actually do a proper invasion

120
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:36,954
He was not willing to supply the proper air support once the invasion started happening

121
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:43,952
He was not willing to commit more US troops once the invasion started looking like it was not going in

122
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,186
the direction of the exiles

123
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:47,503
Kennedy on the other hand blames the CIA

124
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:52,503
He says look this was just done and planned incompetently

125
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,735
He also says that "You gave me all sorts of misinformation, you told me that once the invasion

126
00:11:56,735 --> 00:12:02,687
started there was all sorts of resentment against Fidel Castro that would cause this broader

127
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,396
uprising, which never ever happened."

128
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:10,942
This is actually a quote from John F Kennedy that he said after the Bay of Pigs invasion

129
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:14,459
"The first advice that I am going to give to my successor is to watch

130
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,276
the generals and to avoid feeling that because they were military men their opinions on military manners

131
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:20,428
were worth a damn" JFK

132
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:22,926
This is JFK after the Bay of Pigs invasion

133
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:26,659
You can dig deeper and figure out who probably was in the right here

134
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:35,352
But the bottom line here is that this lead to all round negative consequences for the US

135
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:41,503
After this kind of strength in Fidel Castro's hold on Cuba

136
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:44,353
He was like hey that was the US's best shot

137
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:48,003
Huge embarrassment for them it allowed his to concentrate his control

138
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:52,537
It also caused him to now become very openly communist

139
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:58,127
Before the Bay of pigs invasion he was kind of trying to get the US to somewhat like him

140
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:02,293
Although they would not like him because he was taking over private property and he was clearly left

141
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:03,543
leaning

142
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:09,243
But after the Bay of Pigs invasion he definetly aligned himself closely with the soviet union

143
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:15,492
So he became much more open about being a Marxist, Lenninist, communist state

144
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:23,581
and because he as afraid of the future US invasions he was open to what eventually leads

145
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:31,164
to the Cuban Missile Crisis which is the Soviet Union actually placing balistic missiles with nuclear

146
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:36,279
war heads in Cuba within short reach of the United states. It set up this whole

147
00:13:36,279 --> 99:59:59,999
series of events that did not really end up working in favour of the United States
