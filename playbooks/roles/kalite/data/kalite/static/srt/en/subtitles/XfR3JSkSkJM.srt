1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,170
In the depreciation video, we
saw that if a company had to

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,730
buy some equipment for its
factory, let's say at the

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:11,060
beginning of 2007, just based
on the cash that went out of

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,970
the door, there might have been
this temptation to say,

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,950
OK, in 2007, we had an
equipment expense.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,200
EQ expense.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,290
   

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,540
And they could have just
wrote, let's say that

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,060
equipment cost $50,000.

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,940
So they would have just put a
$50,000 expense right in 2007.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,770
I write it as a negative number
just because I like to

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,450
remember it's an expense,
although normally people just

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,406
write it as a positive expense,
but I always like to

15
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,340
put a negative for an expense
to know that it's going to

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,980
subtract from your revenue.

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,080
So they would put that cash
expense there in 2007.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:53,760
And then in future years, maybe
2008, 2009, 2010, they

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,070
would have no expense until
maybe they had to replace that

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,550
machine or buy a new one.

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,795
And we saw that that is one way
to account for things, but

22
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,180
it really doesn't reflect the
reality of the business.

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,810
The fact that this machine right
here that cost $50,000

24
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,030
is used for-- in this example,
in the depreciation video, it

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,120
was usable for two years.

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,390
Let's say in this example, it's
usable for four years.

27
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,970
So what they do is, instead of
just expensing the cost of the

28
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,220
machine, when the machine is
bought on the balance sheet at

29
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,390
the beginning of 2007, they
say, we now have an asset

30
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,745
called a machine.

31
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:31,900
I'll just call it
M for machine.

32
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,450
That's $50,000 at this point
right here, right when we

33
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,150
bought the machine.

34
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,760
Remember, balance sheets
are snapshots in time.

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,720
And then instead of having an
equipment expense, instead of

36
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,800
having that expense, they'll
have an equipment

37
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,050
depreciation expense.

38
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,970
   

39
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,300
And the difference here is
instead of saying that the

40
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,240
entire expense was that machine
in just the first

41
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,470
period, they're saying no,
we're using some of the

42
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,700
machine in that period.

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,110
And let's say we do a
straight-line depreciation,

44
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,460
which means we essentially
depreciate the asset evenly

45
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,949
over its lifespan.

46
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,130
So in this case, we're assuming

47
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,600
it's a four-year lifespan.

48
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,860
So let me draw that out.

49
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,420
So the asset should linearly
go to zero

50
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,350
over these four years.

51
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,720
So essentially, in the
first year, our

52
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,830
expense would be what?

53
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,000
It's $12,000.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,130
If you divide $50,000
by 4, it's $12,500.

55
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:37,040
It would be minus $12,500 in
each year, depreciation

56
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:45,340
expense, and we would account
for it on the balance sheet.

57
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,500
Because remember, income
statements are just telling

58
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,320
you how do you get from one
balance sheet to another.

59
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,830
So expenses reduce the
value of your assets.

60
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,960
So, for example, in this one,
at the beginning of the

61
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,950
period, before the 2007
income statement, the

62
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,600
asset was worth $50,000.

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,710
We depreciated $12,500 from it,
so at this point in time,

64
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,020
the balance sheet as of the end
of 2007 or the beginning

65
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,780
of 2008, we're going to say
that our machine is now

66
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,370
$12,500 less, so $47,500.

67
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,160
And then at the end of 2008,
beginning of 2009, our balance

68
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,230
sheet under the assets, the
machine, if they gave us that

69
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,550
level of granularity, would
be $12,500 less than that.

70
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:37,350
So that's what? $37,500.

71
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,240
So then the machine
is $25,000.

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,900
And then another $12,500
on the books.

73
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,960
It'll say the machine
is worth $12,500.

74
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
And then at the end of
2010, it'll say the

75
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,550
machine is worth nothing.

76
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,390
And if we did our depreciation
schedule right, or if the

77
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,630
lifespan of this machine really
is four years, then

78
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,990
it's time to go buy another
machine and start doing this

79
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,730
all over again.

80
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,430
This is all a review of the
depreciation video.

81
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,500
Amortization is the exact same
thing, but it deals with

82
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,790
intangible assets.

83
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,870
What's an intangible?

84
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,560
It's something you can't see,
touch, feel, smell, eat.

85
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,670
Obviously , a machine you can't
do all of those things

86
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,279
to it, but you can at least
touch it and possibly smell

87
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,399
and taste it.

88
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,740
So an intangible asset, we can't
do any of that stuff to,

89
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,790
but it's the exact same idea.

90
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:31,720
For example, let's say we are
some type of widget company.

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,460
And let me write down
the years: 2007,

92
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,090
2008, 2009 and 2010.

93
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,400
And let's say that if we just
did it from a cash point of

94
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,090
view, let's say we had
to buy a patent in

95
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,810
order to make our widgets.

96
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,200
So we could have said, oh, we
have to buy a patent expense.

97
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,940
We had to buy a patent
from some

98
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,680
brilliant inventor someplace.

99
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,000
We could just say, oh,
you know what?

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,240
The patent cost $4,000.

101
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,800
So we could just put that there
even though the useful

102
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,130
life of the patent might
be four years.

103
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,640
And so it doesn't reflect the
fact that we still are using

104
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,260
that patent in these years, and
we just take the hit here.

105
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,160
So this income will look
unusually low, while these

106
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,860
will look unusually high.

107
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,830
It's not reflective of the fact
that you're using this

108
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,540
patent that has four
years left on it.

109
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,660
So instead of doing that, what
you do is, at the beginning of

110
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,360
the period you say, we have
acquired a patent, an asset,

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,000
that is worth $4,000, And then
every year over the life of

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,950
the patent, we'd amortize a
fourth of it since it has a

113
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,900
four-year life.

114
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,760
So it would be patent
amortization.

115
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,620
And there's all sorts of
intangible assets that you

116
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,740
might amortize.

117
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,820
And amortizing really just means
spreading out the cost

118
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,400
of this asset, just like
depreciation was spreading out

119
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
the cost of a physical asset.

120
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,070
So patent amortization would be
$1,000 in this year, $1,000

121
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,450
in this year, $1,000 in this
year, and $1,000 in this year.

122
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:12,180
And then our snapshot, or our
balance sheet at the end of

123
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,030
2007, will have on its
assets a patent

124
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,280
that's now worth $3,000.

125
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,930
And at the end of 2008,
it'll have a patent

126
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,395
that's now worth $2,000.

127
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:24,040
The end of 2009-- I think you
get the point-- you'll have a

128
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,760
patent worth $1,000.

129
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,530
And at the end of 2010, probably
because the patent is

130
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,430
now expired and anyone can go
out and produce whatever that

131
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,170
invention that was patented
without having the patent, we

132
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,400
then say that the patent
is worthless.

133
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,570
And a very relevant thing is if
you were a drug company and

134
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,550
you were buying the patent to
some pharmaceutical that had

135
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,320
four years left so that you
could have exclusive rights to

136
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,430
develop that drug. and at this
point, all of a sudden, now

137
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,030
anyone can develop the drug, so
that patent is worthless.

138
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,410
So the balance sheet is really
trying to capture what your

139
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,170
asset is worth at that
point in time.

140
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,290
At this point in time, your
patent is arguably only worth

141
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,870
$1,000, because you paid $4,000
for four years, and now

142
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,150
you only have a year left.

143
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,520
But that's all amortization
is.

144
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,770
Nothing fancy.

145
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,540
   

146
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,050
Really, in my mind, it's very
similar to depreciation.

147
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,340
Depreciation is tangible.

148
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,760
Amortization is intangible.

149
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,940
It could be patents, it
could be licenses.

150
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,290
It could be fees associated
with the financing.

151
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,530
Let's say you have some debt
that you took from a company,

152
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,690
and the debt is going to last
for 10 years, and you had to

153
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,010
pay a one-time lump-sum
to the bank.

154
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,020
Well, that one-time lump-sum fee
should probably be spread

155
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,760
over the life of the debt, so
you would amortize that

156
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,470
expense over its life.

157
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,750
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

158
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,000
