1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Perform the indicated operations, then simplify.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have three rational expressions here, and we're going to subtract this one, and we're going to add this one.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So just like if we were adding and subracting a bunch of fractions, we reall have to find a common denominator here.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to figure out a common denominator, we have to figure out the least common multiple of x plus 5, of 2x minus 10, and x squared minus 25.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to find the least common multiple, we really want to factor these out and make sure that least common multiple, that common denominator has all of the constituent factors in it.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this can't be factored anymore. x plus 5, that's about as simple as you can get it.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2x minus 10 we can factor out a 2 and it becomes 2 times x minus 5, so we factor that out.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then x squared minus 25, you might recognize is a different of squares.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's the same thing as x plus 5 times x minus 5. Just factor that out.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so if we want to have a least common multiple- Let me rewrite each of these with that common denominator here, that the least common multiple.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The least common multiple is going to have to be something that has x plus 5 in it. It's going to have a 2 in it. It's going to have an x minus 5 in it.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And well, we've already said it has to have an x plus 5 in it and an x minus 5 in it.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's got to have a 2. It's got to have an x plus 5. It's got to have an x minus 5 in it.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And its got to have an x plus 5 times an x minus 5, well, we've already got that there.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So no need to write it again.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that right there is our common denominator. So let's write it out.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lets write each of these expressions with that common denominator.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 2 times x plus 5 times x minus 5, and then over here I'll write it again. 2 times x plus 5 times x minus 5.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Once you get used to this, you might be able to just write out the common denominator once, and then figure out the appropriate things to multiply the numerators by

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but I want to make sure we go through every step for these videos, just so we make sure we understand what's going on.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So to go from x plus 5 to 2 times x plus 5 times x minus 5, what do we have to multiply x plus five by?

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well we have to multiply it in order to get this. We're multiplying it by a 2. We're multiplying the x plus 5 by 2.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're also multiplying it by an x minus 5.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we're multiplying the denominator by a 2 and an x minus 5, we have to multiply the numerator by a 2 and an x minus 5.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we multiply 2 times x minus 5 times 1, we'll get 2 times x minus 5, and we don't even have to write this 1.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we're subtracting over here, and to get from 2 times x minus 5, what do we have to multiply it by?

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we have the 2 times x minus 5 right over there. We have to multiply it by x plus 5. This is the part that is new.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have to multiply it by an x plus 5. We have to multiply this denominator by x plus 5 to get this denominator.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you multiply the denominator by x plus 5, you want to multiply the numerator by x plus 5 as well.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the numerator is going to be 2 times x plus 5. Just took the 2, multiplied it by x plus 5, exactly what we did to the denominator. We multiplied it by x plus 5.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then we have this last expression right over here. We went from - let me do this in a new color. We went from x plus 5 times x minus 5, to x plus 5 times x minus 5 times 2.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So to go from this denominator to this denominator, we just have to multiply by 2.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you multiply the denominator by 2, you should multiply the numerator by 2.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So multiply 2 times 2x, you're going to get 4x. So all I did here is I multiplied it by 2.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me make it clear. To get from this to this, I multiplied it by x plus 5. And then to go from there to there, I multiplied it by 2 times x minus 5.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Over here, I should use instead of writing multiplied by 2, I should write multiplied by 2. Don't want to get the multiplication symbol confused with the x variable.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And of course there was a positive out here.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we are now ready to do our adding and subtracting.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we could view this just for simplicity, just make it clear. Subtracting this thing is the same things as adding the negative of it.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that makes it a little bit simpler

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets put our common denominator down, so all of this business is going to be in our-

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Denominator is going to be 2 times x plus 5 times x minus 5, and our numerator is now going to be-

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm going to multiply this out, so that we can properly add terms.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 2 times x minus 5 is 2x minus 10. And then we have a negative 2 times x plus 5.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So thats going to be negative 2x, and the negative 2 times 5 is negative 10.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we're going to have a plus 4x over here. Plus 4 x.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we can simplify this thing.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so you have a 2x, you're subtrating a 2x. Those guys cancel out.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then you're left with just a 4x. And then minus 10 minus 10.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 4x minus 20, over 2 times x plus 5 times x minus 5.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then, lets see. We can factor out a 4 up here.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we factor out a 4, this becomes 4 times x minus 5. And then if we assume that we're not dealing with x is equal to positive 5, because that would make the denominator undefined

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can divide the numerator and the denominator by x minus 5. And so if we divide the numerator and denominator by x minus 5, those cancel out.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 2, since they're both divisible by 2.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That 4 divided by 2 is 2, 2 divided by 2 is 1. So in the numerator we're just left with a 2

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in the denominator we're just left with an x plus 5.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, I want to be very careful here, because this expression up here. If we really want this final answer that we got to be truely identical to this expression over here, just a simplified version,

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have to make sure that it has the same domain. Say this was part of the function definition. You want to make sure that it's valid for the same x's and not any more, if you want them to be trely identical.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this up here is not valid, so the domain, if you viewed this as one entire expression, or one entire funciton definition,

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the domain would be all real x's except x is equal to, x cannot be equal to -5 or x cannot be equal to positive 5, because that would make this denominator equal zero.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or x is equal to 5.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you want these two things to be identical, they have to have the same domain. Most algebra classes, people will not be particular about this

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and maybe you don't want them to be the same function, maybe you want it to be defined when x is eqaul to positive 5.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But if you want them to be truely the same expression, you have to have the same domain.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you could, you would want to say it is all real x's except- if you were just doing the domain for this thing,

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you just saw this expression right here, and say ok, x can't be equal to negative 5.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But if you want them to have the same domain, so let me write: except x is qual to negative 5 and x equal to-

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so this right here is just the domain for this thing, but if you wanted to have the same domain as the original expression, you'd also throw in, and x is equal to 5.
