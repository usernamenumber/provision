1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,280
In the last video, I talked
about some of the weaker

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,990
intermolecular forces or
structures of elements.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,260
The weakest, of course, was the
London dispersion force.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,500
In this video, I'll start with
the strongest structure, and

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,530
that's the covalent network.

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,950
So if you have a covalent
network crystal-- and let me

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,860
actually define the
word crystal.

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:25,910
Crystal is just when you have
a solid, where the molecules

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,260
that make up the solid are
in a regular, relatively

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,130
consistent pattern, and this is
versus an amorphous solid,

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,790
where everything is kind of just
a hodge-podge and there's

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,170
different concentrations of
different things, of different

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,390
ions, and different molecules,
and different

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,270
parts of the solid.

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,640
So crystal is just a very
regular structure.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,970
Ice is a crystal, because once
you get the temperature low

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,810
enough in water, the hydrogen
bonds form a crystal, a

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,700
regular structure.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,160
And we've talked about
that a bunch.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,870
But the strongest of all crystal
structures is the

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,490
covalent network.

23
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,830
And the biggest, or the prime,
example of that is carbon when

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,890
it forms a diamond.

25
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,820
So in the covalent network,
carbon has four valence

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,650
electrons, so it always
wants four more.

27
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,310
So when carbon shares with
itself, it's very happy.

28
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,030
So what it can do is it can form
four bonds to four more

29
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,870
carbons, and then each of those
carbons can form four

30
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,310
more bonds to four
more carbons.

31
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,120
   

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,900
And this, one, 1, 2, 3, and
it just keeps going on.

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,770
This is the structure
of a diamond.

34
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,200
And the reason why this is such
a strong structure is

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,180
because you can almost view
the entire-- in fact, you

36
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,300
should view the entire diamond
as one molecule, because they

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,600
all have covalent bonds.

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,750
These are actual sharing of
electrons, and these are

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,850
actually the strongest of
all molecular bonds.

40
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,630
So you can imagine if the entire
solid is made out of

41
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,560
this network of carbons,
you're going to have an

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,639
extremely strong, extremely high
boiling point substance,

43
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,710
and that's why a diamond is so
strong, and that's why it's so

44
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,260
hard to boil a diamond.

45
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,640
Now, the next two, and it
depends on your special cases

46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,320
of the next most solid version
of a solid, and it depends

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,420
which case you're talking
about, one are the ionic

48
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,830
crystals, and I'll do them both
here, because one isn't

49
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:38,110
necessarily-- ionic crystal--
and the next is the metal.

50
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,110
Well, it's not the next.

51
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:45,010
They're kind of the
metallic crystal.

52
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,060
And these bonds, I mean, let's
say the most common ionic

53
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,530
molecule or-- that's not
exactly the right word,

54
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,560
because to some degree, let's
say if I had some sodium and

55
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,930
some chloride-- and just
remember, what happens with

56
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,740
sodium chloride is sodium here
really has one extra electron

57
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,600
that it's dying to lose.

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,350
Chlorine has seven electrons
and it's dying

59
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,400
to get a new one.

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,570
So sodium essentially donates
its electron to chlorine, and

61
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,370
then the chlorine becomes
negative, the sodium becomes

62
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,620
positive, and they want to be
near each other, right?

63
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,420
So you have a positive sodium
ion and a negative chlorine

64
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,930
ion, and the structure of this
is going to look something

65
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,990
like this, where they're
all-- so let me do

66
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,800
the sodium in green.

67
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,370
So you have a bunch of sodium
ions that are positive, and

68
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,890
then you have a bunch of
chlorine ions that are maybe--

69
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,230
this isn't the exact way that
they actually are, but I think

70
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,890
you get the idea, that one atom
is positive and one atom

71
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,980
is negative, so they really,
really want to be close to

72
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,280
each other.

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,620
And so this is a pretty strong
bond, and it has very-- not a

74
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,740
very high boiling point.

75
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,630
It can have a pretty high
boiling point, and this type

76
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,290
of structure is actually
quite brittle.

77
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,470
So if you take some dry table
salt, not dissolved in water,

78
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,120
if you have a big block of it
and you slam it with a hammer,

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,950
you'll see that you'll get,
like, a big slice of it.

80
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,070
It'll just fall off, right?

81
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,700
Because you're essentially just
cutting it along one of

82
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,600
these lines really fast. That's
the interesting thing.

83
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,700
Whenever you do something on
a macroscale, like cut

84
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,490
something, you really
fundamentally are breaking

85
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,650
atomic bonds.

86
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,240
So the strength of the atomic
bonds really do tell you about

87
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,870
how hard or strong
something is.

88
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,470
Now, the metallic crystal we've
talked a lot about.

89
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,950
Metals, they like to get rid of
their electrons, or not get

90
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,620
rid of them, they like
to share them.

91
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,170
So what happens is, let's say in
the case of iron, you have

92
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,960
a bunch of iron atoms.
This is all iron.

93
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,120
And their electrons are allowed
to roam free in the

94
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,640
neighborhood.

95
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,605
These are all the electrons.

96
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,750
They're allowed to roam free.

97
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,750
And because of this, it forms
this sea of electrons that are

98
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,710
negative, and that makes it
a very good conductor of

99
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,820
electricity.

100
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,120
And, of course, since the iron
atoms have allowed their

101
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,210
electrons to roam, they all
become slightly positive.

102
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,940
And so they're kind of embedded
in this mesh or this

103
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,660
sea of electrons.

104
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,060
And so the metallic crystals,
depending on what cases you

105
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,960
look at, sometimes they're
harder than the ionic

106
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,060
crystals, sometimes not.

107
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,256
Obviously, we could list a lot
of very hard metals, but we

108
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,670
could list a lot of
very soft metals.

109
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,870
Gold, for example.

110
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,160
If you take a screwdriver and a
hammer, you know, pure gold,

111
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,280
24-carat gold, if you take a
screwdriver and hit it onto

112
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,030
the gold, it'll dent
it, right?

113
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,280
So this one isn't as brittle
as the ionic crystal.

114
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,600
It'll often mold to what
you want to do with it.

115
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,350
It's a little bit softer.

116
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,410
Even if you talk about very hard
metals, they tend to not

117
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,700
be as brittle, because the sea
of electrons kind of gives you

118
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,570
a little give when you're
moving around the metal.

119
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,030
But that's not to say
that it's not hard.

120
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,750
In fact, sometimes that give
that a metal has, or that

121
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,880
ability to bend or flex, is
what actually gives it its

122
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,900
strength because it's allowed to
kind of deflect the force.

123
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,990
So the strength, and I've
touched on this, it also goes

124
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,820
into the boiling point.

125
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,200
So because these bonds are
pretty strong, it has a higher

126
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,930
boiling point.

127
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,690
If you just took salt crystal
and tried to boil it, you'd

128
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,900
have to add a lot of heat
into the system.

129
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,500
So this has a higher boiling
point than say-- I mean,

130
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,540
definitely things that have just
van der Waals forces like

131
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,610
the noble gases, but it'll also
have a higher boiling

132
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,590
point than, say, hydrogen
fluoride.

133
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,870
Hydrogen fluoride, if you
remember from the last video,

134
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,970
just had dipole-dipole forces.

135
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,310
But what's interesting about
this is they have a very high

136
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,600
boiling point unless they're
dissolved in water.

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,410
So these are very hard, high
boiling point, but the ionic

138
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,870
crystals can actually be
dissolved in water.

139
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,400
And when they are dissolved
in water, they form

140
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,120
ionic dipole bonds.

141
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,022
What does that mean?

142
00:06:57,022 --> 00:07:04,850
Ionic dipole or ionic
polar bonds.

143
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,280
   

144
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,810
And this is a situation where
the sodium-- and this is

145
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,310
actually why it dissolves
in water.

146
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,260
Because the water molecule,
we've gone over this tons of

147
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,830
times, it has a negative end,
because oxygen is hoarding the

148
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,970
electrons, and then the hydrogen
ends are positive

149
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,290
because the electron's pretty
stripped of it.

150
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,820
So when you put these sodium and
chloride ions in the room,

151
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,020
or in the water solution, the
positive sodiums want to get

152
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:41,510
attracted to the negative side
of this dipole, and then the

153
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:47,450
negative chlorides, Cl minus,
want to go near the hydrogens.

154
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,240
So they kind of get
dissolved in this.

155
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,170
They don't necessarily want to
be-- they still want to be

156
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,440
attracted to each other, but
they're still also attracted

157
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,630
to different sides of the water,
so it allows them to

158
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,780
get dissolved and go with
the flow of the water.

159
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,460
So in this case, when you
actually dissolve an ionic

160
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,300
crystal into water, as an ionic
crystal, not a good

161
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,370
conductor of electricity, not a
lot of charge that is really

162
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,130
movable in this state.

163
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,140
But here, all of a sudden, we
have these charged particles

164
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,430
that can move.

165
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,670
And because they can move, all
of a sudden, when you put

166
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,570
salt, sodium chloride, in
water, that does become

167
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,470
conductive.

168
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,270
So anyway, I wanted you to be
at least exposed to all of

169
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,580
these different forms
of matter.

170
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,480
And now, you should at least get
a sense when you look at

171
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,460
something and you should at
least be able to give a pretty

172
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,780
good guess at how likely it is
to have a high boiling point,

173
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,400
a low boiling point, or
is it strong or not.

174
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,289
And the general way to look at
it is just how strong are the

175
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,809
intermolecular bonds.

176
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,800
Obviously, if the entire
structure is all one molecule,

177
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
it's going to be super-duper
strong.

178
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,530
And on the other hand, if you're
just talking about

179
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:57,020
neon, a bunch of neon molecules,
and all they have

180
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,100
are the London dispersion
forces, this thing's going to

181
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,600
have ultra-weak bonds.

182
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,250
So a gas is almost its
most natural state.

183
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,040
If you get super, super cold,
you might be able to get it to

184
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,520
a fluid, and then everything
in between.

185
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,000
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,721
