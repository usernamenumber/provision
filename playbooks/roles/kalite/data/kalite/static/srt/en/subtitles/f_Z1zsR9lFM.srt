1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,867
I'm here at Stanford Medical School with Neil Gesundheit,

2
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:07,918
who is a faculty member here at the Med School.

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:09,451
NG: Hi.

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,447
SK: So, what are we going to talk about?

5
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:15,441
NG: Well, the topic for today is Endocrinology, which is the study of hormones.

6
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:21,246
NG: The word hormone is derived from the Greek word which means "arouse the activity."

7
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:26,333
N: And what hormones do is they're chemical messengers that are made at one part of the body

8
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:32,000
and typically go to another part of the body and, as suggested [by the name],

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,133
"arouse the activity" and give function to another organ.

10
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,733
S: So they essentially are a kind of signalling,

11
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,800
a way to communicate between one part of the body and the other.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,667
N: Exactly. They are very sophisticated communicators,

13
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,000
I think that's a perfect term.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,200
Another way to think of it is that our body can communicate directly--e.g., nerves innervate muscle,

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,400
and when you want to contract your muscle you give a signal from your brain,

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,533
it goes down the nerve and it directly attaches to the muscle and causes it to contract--

17
00:00:56,533 --> 00:01:01,333
Whereas hormones are more like the Wi-Fi of the human body:

18
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:06,456
They are wireless. They are made in one place and go into the bloodstream--

19
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:08,127
--which are like the airwaves, if you will--

20
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:13,468
--and [the hormones] work on another part of the body at a distance,

21
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:18,933
without directly, mechanically connecting to that part of the body.

22
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:25,449
S: And hormones, are they a specific type of protein or a specific type of chemical,

23
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:27,493
or are they pretty much anything that will do what you described?

24
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:30,933
N: They are pretty much anything but they fall into two major categories:

25
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,180
There are small molecules typically derived from amino acids,

26
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,933
and those molecules are 300-500 daltons--aka, mmu--

27
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:47,276
up to large proteins which can be hundreds and hundreds of amino acids in size.

28
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:50,620
S: I see, so anything that has a signaling function...

29
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,234
N: That's right, would be considered a hormone.

30
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:57,702
N: And the other thing is, when we talk about hormones, is the three subcategories,

31
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:01,974
we call some of them 'endocrine' hormones, where they get in the bloodstream and work at a far distance.

32
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:05,550
And we'll give some examples with your diagram there in just a minute.

33
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,197
But there are others that are called paracrine hormones,

34
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:12,284
and paracrine hormones are more regionally active,

35
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:18,043
So, they might be made, say, in one part of the body and work within a small distance of that site.

36
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:23,569
N: And then the third category, which would be less common, is the autocrine hormones.

37
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:32,021
And the autocrine are made directly in one cell and work on that same or the cell right next door,

38
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:34,250
at a very small distance.

39
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,962
S: I see. Are these things--I think I have a mental model for it--endocrine hormones

40
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:46,139
are released, and faraway in the body they are picked up by some receptor,

41
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:52,733
the paracrine hormones, is their effect small because they are only able to travel small distance?

42
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:58,399
N: Typically the paracrine hormones do get into the bloodstream,

43
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:02,579
but the concentration of the receptor--the receiving end, is right close by--

44
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:08,244
so it tends to make the paracrine hormones work regionally, is the high concentration of

45
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:11,170
the receptors is very close to the site of synthesis.

46
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,238
S: I see.

47
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:18,322
N: And the same with autocrine hormones, they are made and there is a very high concentration of

48
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:20,504
the receiving end right at that cell.

49
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:27,656
S: And, this might be a silly question, there are endocrinologists, are there paracrinologists?

50
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:30,675
N: Well, that's a good point, I don't think so.

51
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:34,901
I think we just--because the paracrine function of hormones was discovered later--

52
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:38,755
we still carry this all under the umbrella of endocrinology.

53
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:42,981
S: So all hormones are in endocrinology, the endocrine hormones are those working at far distances.

54
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,978
N: That's right. I think that's a good way to summarize it.

55
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:49,343
I like the diagram you have here because it illustrates some of the major endocrine ogans,

56
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:54,777
the ones we'll be focusing on in later lectures. So the first one you showed very nicely,

57
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:59,700
in the head, at the base of the brain, is that orange structure--and that would be

58
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,622
the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is called the "master gland" because

59
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:09,220
from the pituitary gland we make hormones that work on yet other organs.

60
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,003
So, I'll give you an example, one of the hormones made by the pituitary is called the

61
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,279
thyroid-stimulating hormone, or the TSH.

62
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:23,523
And after it leaves the pituitary, it goes into the circulation, and it acts on the thyroid where

63
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:26,913
there are high receptors for TSH on the surface of the thyroid cells,

64
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:32,161
and it stimulates the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormone, typically thyroxine (T4), or

65
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:37,827
triiodothyronine (T3). Those are the two main circulating thyroid hormones.

66
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,266
S: And what do those do?

67
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:42,889
N: Those regulate metabolism, they regulate appetite, they regulate thermogenesis,

68
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:48,554
they regulate muscle function--they have widespread activities on other parts of the body.

69
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,573
S: They are kinda up-regulates or down-regulates the metabolism of your entire body

70
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:56,031
N: That's right. So someone with hyperthyroidism will have very high metabolism,

71
00:04:56,031 --> 00:05:02,115
you may know the classic picture of someone with the high heart rate, rapid metabolism, weight loss--

72
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:04,530
that would be someone with excessive amounts of thyroid hormone.

73
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,524
And then you see pretty much the inverse picture when someone has a deficiency of thyroid hormone--

74
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:13,307
hypothyroidism. So, it's critical to maintain just the right amount of all of these hormones, and

75
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:16,558
thyroid hormones is a good example.

76
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:19,437
But the ultimate regulation is from that pituitary gland.

77
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:22,223
S: Right, this is kinda the master one, it sends a signal there and...

78
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:27,982
N: That's right. And we'll talk later about feedback loops, because how does the pituitary know when

79
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:33,648
to stop making TSH? Basically, like a thermostat, it can sense the level of thyroid hormone,

80
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:38,709
and when those hormones are at just the right level, and not too high, it will decrease the amount of

81
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:42,378
TSH it makes, if the levels are too low, it will stimulate production of TSH to make the

82
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:44,607
thyroid gland make more thyroid hormone.

83
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:47,487
S: Very cool. What else do we have here?

84
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:51,991
N: The other hormones, some of the major ones, the pituitary, in addition to making TSH,

85
00:05:51,991 --> 00:06:00,861
it makes a hormone called ACTH, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, which acts on the adrenal cortex,

86
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,855
and the adrenal is the gland that sits right on top of the kidney,

87
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:09,313
and the outer layers of the adrenal gland are the adrenal cortex,

88
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:12,193
and those are stimulated by ACTH.

89
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:16,140
S: They are not related to the kidney, they just sit on top there?

90
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,967
N: Right. They're related only in the sense that the blood supply is rich, like the kidneys' blood supply,

91
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:28,911
and they happen to sit above the kidney. They are called 'ADrenal' because they are

92
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:31,651
adjacent to the kidney, which is the 'renal' part,

93
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:33,555
S: OH! That should've been obvious. X.x

94
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:38,663
N: But they don't per se, filter blood or do any of the key functions of the kidneys.

95
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:42,007
S: I see 8-) So what's their role?

96
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:48,880
N: The adrenal glands make the adrenal hormones like cortisol, which regulates glucose metabolism,

97
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,341
which maintains blood pressure and well-being,

98
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:57,425
and then it makes mineralocorticoids like aldosterone which is important in regulating

99
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:03,044
salt-water balance. You also have adrenal androgens, which are somewhat important.

100
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:07,131
And those three hormones are the main hormones made by the adrenal cortex.

101
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:08,989
S: I see 8-)

102
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:14,236
N: The ACTH primarily regulates the cortisol and the adrenal androgens,

103
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:19,531
and there's another system that regulates the mineralocorticoids, that we'll talk about later.

104
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:22,642
S: Okay. And we have a few more organs here? :-9

105
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:27,565
N: Also out of the pituitary we make luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.

106
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:29,701
Those are abbreviated LH and FSH.

107
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:38,153
And those act on the gonads, so in the male on the testis, and in the female on the ovaries,

108
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:46,001
to stimulate development of sperm in the male, and oocytes (eggs) in the female,

109
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:50,413
and also the production of gonadosteroids, predominantly testosterone in the male,

110
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:53,292
and estradiol in the female.

111
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,661
S: O.O...how many more...are we missing any thing?

112
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:59,283
N: Well, there are two other hormones that are derived from the anterior pituitary,

113
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:04,484
and those are the Growth Hormone (GH) which is critical for optimal growth (e.g., of long bones)

114
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,992
S: Pituitary really does do a whole lot X.X

115
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,664
N: It does! MUAHAHA!!

116
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:10,893
S: hGH, human Growth Hormone?

117
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:16,512
N: Right. and that works e.g., on long bones, and we would have prolactin (LTH),

118
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:21,992
which in women is important in lactation, being able to breast feed after delivering a child.

119
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:23,525
S: And insulin is...

120
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:28,447
N: Insulin is key, but it doesn't come from the pituitary. So now we're gonna work our way down a bit,

121
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,816
we talked about the thyroid gland making the thyroid hormones,

122
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:34,299
and when you get to the pancreas, which is that yellow structure right in the middle,

123
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:40,104
inside of the pancreas there are small islands called "the islets of Langerhans,"

124
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:48,509
and the islets within the pancreas make endocrine hormones, like insulin and glucagon,

125
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:54,314
But insulin is vital, without insulin you have diabetes. and without insulin you

126
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:58,680
don't transport glucose into muscle, and remove glucose from the bloodstream normally.

127
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,531
And the absence of insulin can produce all the symptoms of diabetes that we'll talk about later [?! :(

128
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:09,407
S: And it seems, just structurally, you have the pancreas right here, you have the adrenal glands right

129
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:12,797
there, they're all kinda near that interchange...because they're all so important...

130
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:19,531
N: Yeah, that's a good observation. They all have a lot venous drainage from them,

131
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,736
so when they make their hormones, it gets into the bloodstream rather quickly,

132
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,733
because they are vital structures.

133
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:29,284
S: Very cool 8-). I think we can leave it there, and for the next video you have some pictures which

134
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:31,095
look pretty interesting =-D

135
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:35,089
N: Okay, in the next video we'll talk about how you have to have the right amount of a hormone,

136
00:09:35,089 --> 99:59:59,999
or else things go awry.
