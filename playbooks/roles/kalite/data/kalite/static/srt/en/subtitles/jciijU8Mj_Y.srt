1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,980
We're on problem 1.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,440
   

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,060
A project scheduled to be
carried out over a single

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,070
fiscal year has a budget
of $12,600.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,820
Divide it into 12 equal
monthly allocations.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,440
So if we divide it by 12
how much are we going

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,180
to spend per month?

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,620
So that's $1,050 per month.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:24,950
Right?

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,040
12,000 divided by 12 is 1,000.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,550
600 divided by 12 is 50.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,440
So they're going to spend
$1,050 per month.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,340
At the end of the fourth month
of that fiscal year, the total

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,800
amount actually spent on
the project was 4,580.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,680
So 4,580 after four months.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,920
By how much was the project
over its budget?

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,120
Well, let's see how much
they should have

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,470
spent after four months.

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,670
So after four months
they should have

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,380
spent 1,050 times 4.

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,040
That's what?

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,340
That's 4,000.

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,390
4 times 50.

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,890
200.

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,240
That's how much they should have
spent after four months

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,100
if they were on budget.

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,330
They ended up spending 4,580.

28
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,430
So let's see how much
they spent too much.

29
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,040
They spent $380 too much.

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,770
And that is choice A.

31
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,160
Next question.

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,150
Question 2.

33
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,950
For which of the following
values of n is 100 plus n over

34
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,390
n not an integer?

35
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,500
We could simplify this.

36
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,730
This is the same thing as 100
over n plus n over n, which is

37
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,150
equal to 100 over n plus 1.

38
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,760
So in order for this not
to be an integer--

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,000
this is the same thing.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,190
1 is clearly an integer,
so this can't

41
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,370
be an integer, right?

42
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,850
So we have to pick an n that
is essentially not

43
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,160
divisible into 100.

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,510
So what are their choices?

45
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,590
So they say 1.

46
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,880
Well 100 is clearly
divisible by 1.

47
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,030
You'll get an integer there.

48
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,380
So it's not 1.

49
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:04,740
2.

50
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,250
100 is clearly divisible by 2.

51
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,710
100 divided by 2 is 50.

52
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,930
That's not it.

53
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,180
3.

54
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,380
100 divided by 3.

55
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,900
That's 33.333.

56
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,840
That's not an integer.

57
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,940
So choice 3 will not produce
an integer if it's selected

58
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,635
for n, so we're at C.

59
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:23,640
The answer is C.

60
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,290
Next question.

61
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,960
3.

62
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,580
Rectangular floors x and
y have equal area.

63
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,520
If floor x is 12 by 18--
let me draw that.

64
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,630
This is floor x.

65
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,840
They say it's 12 by 18.

66
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,360
And floor y is 9 feet wide.

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,560
What is the length of
floor y in feet?

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,330
OK, I didn't have to
draw this, I think.

69
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,600
   

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,810
So floor y is 9 feet wide.

71
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,130
   

72
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,250
So they're saying it has the
same area, so essentially

73
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,660
they're saying that
9 times-- and they

74
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,105
want to know its length.

75
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,730
So let's call that l.

76
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,890
So the area of floor y, which is
9l, is equal to the area of

77
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,825
floor x, which is equal
to 18 soon. times 12.

78
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,450
And I even multiply this out,
because I don't know off the

79
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,960
top of my head what 18 times 12
is, but we can just divide

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,090
both sides by 9, and we get l is
equal to-- let's divide the

81
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,960
18 by the 9.

82
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,045
2 times 12, which
is equal to 24.

83
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,460
And that's choice E.

84
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,710
Next problem.

85
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,200
   

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
Problem 4.

87
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,390
A case contains c cartons.

88
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:52,410
Each carton contains b boxes and
each box contains c-- OK,

89
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,970
so c cartons.

90
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,715
OK, case is equal
to c cartons.

91
00:03:57,715 --> 00:04:01,710
   

92
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,845
Carton is equal to b boxes.

93
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:10,930
   

94
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:22,210
And then they say a box is
equal to 100 paper clips.

95
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,350
How many paper clips are
contained in 2 cases?

96
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:32,620
So we could say 2 cases is equal
to 2c cartons, right?

97
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,540
   

98
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,640
So each carton has
how many boxes?

99
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,830
Has b boxes, right?

100
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,480
So this is going to be
equal to 2 times c.

101
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,700
Right?

102
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,150
That's how many cartons, and
each carton has b boxes.

103
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,260
So it's going to be equal
to 2cb boxes.

104
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,450
And then each of these boxes
is going to have 100 paper

105
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,650
clips, so times 100.

106
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:08,450
So that is equal to
200cb paper clips.

107
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,630
And that is choice C.

108
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,770
They wrote bc instead of cb,
but that's the same thing.

109
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,500
So that is choice C.

110
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,460
Next question.

111
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,590
Question 5.

112
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,790
The sum of prime numbers that
are greater than 60, but less

113
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,640
than 70 is?

114
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,510
So let's just think of them.

115
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,590
60 is not prime so that
doesn't work.

116
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,290
61 as far as I can
tell is prime.

117
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:34,740
Right?

118
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,460
I can't think of any numbers
that go into it, although

119
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,840
maybe I'm missing a few.

120
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,900
62 isn't prime.

121
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,700
That's even.

122
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,930
63 is 9 times 7.

123
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,660
That's not prime.

124
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,040
64 is 8 times 8.

125
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,050
65.

126
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,280
That's not prime,
divisible by 5.

127
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,910
66?

128
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,810
Nope.

129
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,860
67.

130
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,650
Is 67 prime?

131
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,810
Let's see, 67.

132
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,440
I think it is.

133
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,490
I can't think of any numbers
that go into it.

134
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,560
68 is not prime.

135
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,090
It's even.

136
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,540
69 is divisible by 3.

137
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,170
And 70 is clearly not prime.

138
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,020
So if I'm right, these are
the two prime numbers.

139
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,030
Let me make sure 61
is not divisible.

140
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,430
It's not divisible by 3.

141
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,890
It's not divisible by 7.

142
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,400
Yes, 61.

143
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,950
17 times 3 is 51.

144
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,780
Yes.

145
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,620
I can't think of anything.

146
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,340
So if we add these two numbers
up, I get 128.

147
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,250
So choice B.

148
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,300
I hope that's right.

149
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,970
Next question.

150
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,900
Question 6. you

151
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,310
A rainstorm increased the amount
of water stored in

152
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,840
state J reservoirs from
124 billion gallons

153
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,500
to 138 billion gallons.

154
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,480
If the storm increased the
amount of water in the

155
00:06:51,480 --> 00:07:02,980
reservoirs to 82% of total
capacity, approximately how

156
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,160
many billion gallons of water
were the reservoirs short of

157
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,090
total capacity prior
to the storm?

158
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,490
So, let's see.

159
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,610
How many billions prior
to the storm.

160
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,940
So this is 82% of
total capacity.

161
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,060
   

162
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,820
So capacity is going
to be equal to 138

163
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,160
divided by 0.82, right?

164
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,510
Well, maybe I skipped a step.

165
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,390
Let me write that.

166
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,810
82% of total capacity
is equal to 138.

167
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,970
So you divide both sides by
82%, or 0.82, and you get

168
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:46,292
capacity is equal to
138/0.82, right?

169
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:50,770
And then they want to know how
many billions of gallons of

170
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,420
water were the reservoirs short
of total capacity prior

171
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,090
to the storm.

172
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,650
So it's going to be this
number-- this is total

173
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,620
capacity-- minus what they were
prior to the storm, 124.

174
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,200
So we just have to do a little
bit of mathematics.

175
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,120
I don't know if they allow you
to use a calculator, but I

176
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,690
think we can do this
on our own.

177
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,550
0.82 goes into 138.

178
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,410
And we could take this decimal
point two over, so we can move

179
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,340
this decimal point
two to the right.

180
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,410
So we get that there.

181
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,330
So it becomes 82 goes into
13,800 how many times.

182
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,930
So 82 goes into 138 1 time.

183
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,080
We get 6.

184
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,230
13 minus 8 is 56.

185
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,429
560.

186
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,490
82 goes into 560--
Well, let's see.

187
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,610
80 goes into 56 6 times.

188
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,780
6 times 82 is 12, plus 1.

189
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,100
6 times 8 is 48.

190
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,560
49.

191
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,890
And then we're left
with, let's see.

192
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,751
What is that?

193
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:00,040
This becomes a 5.

194
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,230
This becomes 15.

195
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,720
So we're left with 68.

196
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,100
680.

197
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:15,980
82 goes into 680 8 times.

198
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,480
8 times 2 is 16.

199
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,110
8 times 8 is 64.

200
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,940
65.

201
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,720
And you're left with, I don't
know, what is this?

202
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,880
24.

203
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,810
240.

204
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,720
So after the decimal it keeps
going, but the total capacity

205
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,390
is about 168.

206
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,580
So how short were they?

207
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,830
168 minus 124.

208
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,040
So 68 minus 24 is 44 gallons.

209
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,030
And that's choice E.

210
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,765
They give you a little bit of
hairy decimal problems. I

211
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:45,970
don't know if calculators
are allowed, but we

212
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,280
did it without one.

213
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,730
Problem 7.

214
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,960
Actually, I'm almost of time.

215
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,320
I'll continue this in
the next video.

216
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:52,570
See you soon.
