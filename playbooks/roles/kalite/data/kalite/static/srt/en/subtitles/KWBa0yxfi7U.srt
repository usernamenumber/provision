1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,080
Now on problem number 15.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,570
When it is noon Eastern Standard Time in New York City,

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,020
it is 9 am Pacific Standard Time in San Francisco.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,470
Well we know that. There's a three hour difference

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,080
between New York and San Francisco.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,420
A plane took off from New York City

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,010
at noon Eastern Standard Time.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,010
So it takes off from New York City

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,430
at 12 noon Eastern Standard Time.

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,010
What time is that in Pacific Standard Time?

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,730
Well they're three hours back,

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,040
so that's also 9 Pacific Standard Time.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,560
A plane took off in New York City

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,940
at 12 noon Eastern Standard Time

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,060
and arrived at San Francisco at 4 pm Pacific Standard Time.

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,000
So this is am.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,030
And so it goes to SFO,it goes to San Francisco where I live.

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,840
I live a little south of San Francisco. But anyway,

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,030
so it goes to San Francisco and what time does it get there?

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:08,010
It says 4 pm Pacific Standard Time.

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,690
And we know that New York is three hours ahead,

22
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,620
so that's Eastern Standard Time there,

23
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,090
so that's also 7 pm Eastern Standard Time.

24
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,950
I'm an expert at this because I work for a hedge fund

25
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,760
where all we do is schedule a lot of calls

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,030
with the company management.

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,910
And they happen to, normally,

28
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,360
not be in the same time zone as we are,

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,070
so we're pros at scheduling calls across time zones.

30
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,040
So this is like second nature.

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,020
I'm enjoying this problem more than most people.

32
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,020
Back to the problem.

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,190
If a second plane left San Francisco

34
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,730
at noon Pacific Standard Time--

35
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:50,580
so at 12 pm Pacific Standard Time, and what is that?

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,360
That's also 3 pm Eastern Standard Time-- and took the exact,

37
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,810
same amount of time for the trip, what was the arrival time

38
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,050
Eastern Standard Time in New York City?

39
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,040
So what time is it in Eastern Standard Time?

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,710
So the first thing we just have to figure out is

41
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,690
how long does the trip take, and then do the second part.

42
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,090
So how long did this trip take?

43
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,000
This plane left at 12 Eastern and arrived at 7 pm Eastern,

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,970
so it took 7 hours. And that was easy,

45
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,070
because we started from 12 and we went to 7, right?

46
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,470
Similarly, if we're going to leave at 3 pm Eastern Time--

47
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,600
because we want to stay in Eastern Time,

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,690
because our final answer has to be Eastern Time--

49
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,030
if we leave at 3 pm Eastern Time and take 7 hours,

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,730
we're going to get there at 10 pm Eastern Standard Time,

51
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,040
which is choice A.

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
The trick of this problem is really just staying in one,

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,060
consistent time zone the whole time.

54
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,390
You could stay in, maybe,

55
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,040
the Eastern Standard Time the whole time.

56
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,070
Next problem.

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,030
It looks like I'll have to draw something.

58
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,010
I'll draw this rectangle.

59
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll draw it in yellow.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,030
So let's say this is a rectangle.

61
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:09,050
And then I'll try my best to draw some of these circles.

62
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,300
We'll just look at the part that's inside of the rectangle,

63
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:20,090
because I don't feel like erasing all that other stuff.

64
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,010
Well this is not perfect.

65
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,090
These points touch, right?

66
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,110
Actually, let me erase all that other stuff,

67
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,020
because it's distracting.

68
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,010
So I'll erase this.

69
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm trying my best to draw neat.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,910
Let me erase all of the rest of the circle just so

71
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,040
it doesn't distract you from what's already drawn there.

72
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,020
Almost done.

73
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,010
Sometimes I feel like that guy who paints pictures on PBS,

74
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,300
because I spend so much time drawing these diagrams.

75
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,030
What's his name, Bob? OK.

76
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,090
So let's see, I was using yellow.

77
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,020
Let me fill that in a little bit. OK.

78
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,090
What are the points that they draw?

79
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:19,050
They say that that's point Q, point P, point T,

80
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:24,010
point R, point S.

81
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:32,760
In rectangle P, Q, R, S above, arcs Q, T

82
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,050
and R, T are quarter circles with centers at P and S. OK.

83
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,010
So these are quarter circles with centers at P and S.

84
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,900
If the radius of each circle is 1--

85
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,480
so the radius is 1, so this is 1, right?

86
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,000
Because this is a radius.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is the radius of the circle-- this distance is also 1.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,010
What is the area of the shaded region?

89
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:57,050
So they drew the shaded region as this.

90
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,050
That's the shaded region they did.

91
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,180
So to figure that out we just have to figure out

92
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,530
the area of the larger rectangle,

93
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,070
and then subtract out the areas of these quarter circles.

94
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,030
So what's the area of this larger rectangle?

95
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,850
Well we know its base because this distance is 1,

96
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,070
this distance is 1.

97
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,010
And we know, in general, that this radius is 1.

98
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,050
This distance is 1, and also this distance is 1.

99
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,060
So the entire rectangle is 2 by 1, right?

100
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,390
This is 1. 1 plus 1 is 2, 2 by 1.

101
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,840
So the area of the rectangle-- I'll call that area sub r--

102
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,020
is equal to 2 times 1, which is equal to 2.

103
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,480
Now we just have to figure out

104
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,090
the area of these quarter circles.

105
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,940
So if I had a whole circle with radius 1,

106
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,020
what would its area be?

107
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,040
So it would be area is pi r squared.

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,670
And if the radius is 1, the area would is equal to--

109
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,060
well pi times 1 squared is just pi, pi times 1.

110
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,060
So the area would be pi for a full circle, right?

111
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,190
So the area for a quarter circle--

112
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,520
I could do it in this color--

113
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:07,760
the area of that blue right there,

114
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,010
area of blue would be pi over 4, right?

115
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,020
Because it's a quarter circle, this is pi/4.

116
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,020
And similarly, that one would also be another pi over 4.

117
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,710
So the area of the shaded area

118
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,060
would be the area of the rectangle, which is 2.

119
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,020
You probably can't even see that blue.

120
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,970
The area of the rectangle is 2 minus the area of

121
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,000
each of these quarter circles, minus pi over 4.

122
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:48,030
And so this would be 2 minus pi over 2, which is choice B.

123
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,010
Next problem.

124
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:56,090
Looks like more drawing for me.

125
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,080
OK.

126
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,010
So they drew this graph, and I guess I will draw it too,

127
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,550
because the whole point of what I'm doing is trying to

128
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:11,860
explain to you how to do these problems. Let's see,

129
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,060
so draw my axes x and y.

130
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,080
And then the graph comes in like this.

131
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,070
Then it dips down like this.

132
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,050
And then it goes up like this.

133
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,000
And they give us a couple of points on the graph.

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,050
They say that this point here is, 0, 1.

135
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,000
And they say that this point, right there, is 1, 0.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,350
And they say the graph of y equals f of x is shown above.

137
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,010
So this is y is equal to f of x.

138
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,270
Which of the following could be the graph of y

139
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,000
is equal to f of x plus 2?

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,980
So if you've done this in class,

141
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,040
this is kind of a traditional shifting problem.

142
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,070
So what you have to realize is, when you take x plus 2--

143
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,020
before when you had, let's say, when x--

144
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,010
let's put it this way.

145
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,080
Before when x and f of-- and y.

146
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,010
Let's do x and y.

147
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,030
When x was equal to 0, y was equal to 1, right?

148
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,080
And when x is equal 1, y is equal to 0.

149
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:34,090
Now what happens when x and y--

150
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:39,000
I still want to input 0 into f of x, right?

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,900
I still want to input 0 into f of x,

152
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,470
because f of 0 is going to be the same thing.

153
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,450
But if I want to put 0 into f of x,

154
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,000
I have to put a negative 2 in here, right?

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,420
Now when x is equal to negative 2,

156
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,480
then this expression here becomes 0, right?

157
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,200
f of negative 2 plus 2 is equal to 0,

158
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,040
so that's equal to the old f of 0.

159
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,070
So then that equals 1.

160
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,750
And if I wanted a 1 here,

161
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,010
I would have to put a minus 1 in for x, right?

162
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,060
Think about it.

163
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,000
If I take a minus 1, and I input it into this expression,

164
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,010
then I get f of 1, right?

165
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,290
If I put minus 1-- my phone is ringing,

166
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,670
it's slightly distracting. But anyway, focus.

167
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,080
I only have 30 seconds left.

168
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,960
But f of minus 1--

169
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,660
Actually, let me continue this into the next thing,

170
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,040
and let me answer my phone.
