1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,150
We know that when we have some
substance in a liquid state,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,790
it has enough kinetic energy for
the molecules to move past

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,530
each other, but still not
enough energy for the

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,100
molecules to completely move
away from each other.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,530
So, for example, this
is a liquid.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,960
Maybe they're moving
in that direction.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,590
These guys are moving a little
bit slower in that direction

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,490
so there's a bit of this flow
going on, but still there are

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,540
bonds between them.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,060
They kind of switch between
different molecules, but they

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,380
want to stay close
to each other.

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,330
There are these little bonds
between them and they want to

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:32,940
stay close.

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,260
If you increase the average
kinetic energy enough, or

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,470
essentially increase the
temperature enough and then

16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,810
overcome the heat of fusion, we
know that, all of a sudden,

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,740
even these bonds aren't strong
enough to even keep them

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,850
close, and the molecules
separate and they get into a

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,560
gaseous phase.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,050
And there they have a lot of
kinetic energy, and they're

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,320
bouncing around, and they take
the shape of their container.

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,090
But there's an interesting
thing to think about.

23
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,709
Temperature is average
kinetic energy.

24
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,160
Which implies, and it's true,
that all of the molecules do

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,940
not have the same
kinetic energy.

26
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,330
Let's say even they did.

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,310
Then these guys would bump into
this guy, and you could

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,430
think of them as billiard balls,
and they transfer all

29
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,550
of the momentum to this guy.

30
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,290
Now this guy has a ton
of kinetic energy.

31
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,870
These guys have a lot less.

32
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,050
This guy has a ton.

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,050
These guys have a lot less.

34
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,380
There's a huge distribution
of kinetic energy.

35
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,640
If you look at the surface
atoms or the surface

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,490
molecules, and I care about the
surface molecules because

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,450
those are the first ones
to vaporize or-- I

38
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,270
shouldn't jump the gun.

39
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,340
They're the ones capable of
leaving if they had enough

40
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,720
kinetic energy.

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,730
If I were to draw a distribution
of the surface

42
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,240
molecules-- let me draw
a little graph here.

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:07,820
So in this dimension, I have
kinetic energy, and on this

44
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,150
dimension, this is just a
relative concentration.

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,720
And this is just my best
estimate, but it should give

46
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,200
you the idea.

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
So there's some average
kinetic energy at some

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,360
temperature, right?

49
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,780
This is the average
kinetic energy.

50
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,650
And then the kinetic energy of
all the parts, it's going to

51
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,090
be a distribution around that,
so maybe it looks something

52
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,770
like this: a bell curve.

53
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,200
You could watch the statistics
videos to learn more about the

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,870
normal distribution, but
I think the normal

55
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,515
distribution-- this is supposed
to be a normal, so it

56
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:40,470
just gets smaller and smaller
as you go there.

57
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,820
And so at any given time,
although the average is here,

58
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,970
there's some molecules
that have a

59
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,560
very low kinetic energy.

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,590
They're moving slowly or maybe
they have-- well, let's just

61
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,960
say they're moving slowly.

62
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,510
And at any given time, you have
some molecules that have

63
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,770
a very high kinetic energy,
maybe just because of the

64
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,950
random bumps that it gets
from other molecules.

65
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,520
It's accrued a lot of velocity
or at least a lot of momentum.

66
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,740
So the question arises,
are any of these

67
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,680
molecules fast enough?

68
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,820
Do they have enough kinetic
energy to escape?

69
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,690
And so there is some
kinetic energy.

70
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,520
I'll draw some threshold here,
where if you have more than

71
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,710
that amount of kinetic energy,
you actually have enough to

72
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,970
escape if you are
surface atom.

73
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,520
Now, there could be a dude down
here who has a ton of

74
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,050
kinetic energy.

75
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,760
But in order for him to escape,
he'd have to bump

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
through all these other liquid
molecules on the way out, so

77
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,230
it's a very-- in fact, he
probably won't escape.

78
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,540
It's the surface atoms that we
care about because those are

79
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,360
the ones that are interfacing
directly with

80
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,310
the pressure outside.

81
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,530
So let's say this is
the gas outside.

82
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,520
It's going to be much
less dense.

83
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,800
It doesn't have to be, but
let's assume it is.

84
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,420
These are the guys that kind
of can escape into the air

85
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,150
above it, if we assume that
there's some air above it.

86
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,530
So at any given time, there's
some fraction of the particles

87
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,470
or the molecules that
can escape.

88
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,670
So you're next question is, hey,
well, doesn't that mean

89
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,470
that they will be vaporized or
they will turn into gas?

90
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,600
And yes, it does.

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,480
So at any given time,
you have some

92
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,440
molecules that are escaping.

93
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,970
Those molecules-- what it's
called is evaporation.

94
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,350
This isn't a foreign
concept to you.

95
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,510
If you leave water outside, it
will evaporate, even though

96
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,600
outside, hopefully, in your
place, is below the boiling

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,950
temperature, or the normal
boiling temperature of water.

98
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,090
The normal boiling point is
just the boiling point at

99
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,560
atmospheric pressure.

100
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,070
If you just leave water out,
over time, it will evaporate.

101
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,460
What happens is some of these
molecules that have unusually

102
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,820
high kinetic energy do escape.

103
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,990
They do escape, and if you have
your pot or pan outside

104
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,606
or, even better, outside of your
house, what happens is

105
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:51,840
they escape, and then
the wind blows.

106
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,000
The wind will blow and then
blow these guys away.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,010
And then a few more will escape,
the wind blows and

108
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,940
blows them all away.

109
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,330
And a few more escape, and
the wind blows and blows

110
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,440
them all the way.

111
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,810
So over time, you'll end up with
an empty pan that once

112
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,050
held water.

113
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,020
Now, the question is
what happens if you

114
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,210
have a closed system?

115
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,200
Well, we've all done that
experiment, either on purpose

116
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,980
or inadvertently, leaving
something outside and seeing

117
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,010
that the water will evaporate.

118
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,450
What happens in a closed system
where there isn't wind

119
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,100
to blow away?

120
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,780
So let me just draw--
there you go.

121
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,920
Let's say a closed system, and I
have-- it doesn't have to be

122
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,060
water, but I have some
liquid down here.

123
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,350
And there's some pressure
from the air above it.

124
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,020
Let's just say it was at
atmospheric pressure.

125
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,780
It doesn't have to be.

126
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,710
So there's some air and
the air has some

127
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,990
kinetic energy over here.

128
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,200
So, of course, do the
water molecules.

129
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,280
And some of them start
to evaporate.

130
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,490
So some of the water molecules
that are up here in the

131
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,010
distribution, they have enough
energy to escape, so they

132
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,890
start hanging out with the
air molecules, right?

133
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,050
Now something interesting
happens.

134
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,285
This is the distribution
of the molecules

135
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:11,570
in the liquid state.

136
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,350
Well, there's also a
distribution of the kinetic

137
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,080
energies of the molecules
in the gaseous state.

138
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,650
Just like different things are
bumping into each other and

139
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,410
gaining and losing kinetic
energy down here, the same

140
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,570
thing is happening up here.

141
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,150
So maybe this guy has a lot of
kinetic energy, but he bumps

142
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,530
into stuff and he loses it.

143
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,070
And then he'll come back down.

144
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,940
So there's some set
of molecules.

145
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,220
I'll do it in another
set of blue.

146
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,450
These are still the water-- or
whatever the fluid we're

147
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,000
talking about-- that come back
from the vapor state back into

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,250
the liquid state.

149
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,440
And so what happens is, there's
always a bit of

150
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,670
evaporation and there's always
a bit of condensation because

151
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,470
you always have this

152
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,600
distribution of kinetic energies.

153
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,850
At any given moment in time,
out of the vapor above the

154
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,055
liquid, some of the vapor loses
its kinetic energy and

155
00:06:58,055 --> 00:06:59,560
then it goes back into
the liquid state.

156
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,060
Some of the surface liquid gains
kinetic energy by random

157
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,050
bumps and whatever else and
goes into the vapor state.

158
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,700
And the vapor state will
continue to happen until you

159
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,790
get to some type
of equilibrium.

160
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,770
And when you get that
equilibrium, we're at some

161
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,920
pressure up here.

162
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,520
So let me see, some pressure.

163
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,530
And the pressure is caused by
these vapor particles over

164
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:30,970
here, and that pressure is
called the vapor pressure.

165
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,270
I want to make sure you
understand this.

166
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,130
So the vapor pressure is the
pressure created, and this is

167
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:45,770
at a given temperature for
a given molecule, right?

168
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,460
Every molecule or every type
of substance will have a

169
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,810
different vapor pressure at
different temperatures, and

170
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,720
obviously every different type
of substance will also have

171
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,130
different vapor pressures.

172
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,920
For a given temperature and
a given molecule, it's the

173
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,860
pressure at which you have a
pressure created by the vapor

174
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,010
molecules where you have
an equilibrium.

175
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,310
Where you have just as many
things vaporizing as things

176
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,120
going back into the
liquid state.

177
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,310
And we learned before that the
more pressure you have, the

178
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,780
harder it is to vaporize
even more, right?

179
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,530
We learned in the phase state
things that if you are at 100

180
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,190
degrees at ultra-high pressure,
and you were dealing

181
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,410
with water, you would still
be in the liquid state.

182
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,290
So the vapor creates some
pressure and it'll keep

183
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,240
happening, depending
on how badly this

184
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,320
liquid wants to evaporate.

185
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,630
But it keeps vaporizing until
the point that you have just

186
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,309
as much-- I guess you could kind
of view it as density up

187
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,780
here, but I don't want to
think-- you have just as many

188
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,919
molecules here converting into
this state as molecules here

189
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,789
converting into this state.

190
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,420
So just to get an intuition of
what vapor pressure is or how

191
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,750
it goes with different
molecules, molecules that

192
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:59,930
really want to evaporate-- and
so why would a molecule want

193
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,350
to evaporate?

194
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,350
It could have high kinetic
energy, so this would be at a

195
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,530
high temperature.

196
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,690
It could have low intermolecular
forces, right?

197
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,620
[spelling] "...mo-lec-u-lar...."

198
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,250
Obviously, the noble gases
have very low molecular

199
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,200
forces, but in general, most
hydrocarbons or gasoline or

200
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,480
methane or all of these things,
they really want to

201
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,570
evaporate because they have
much lower intermolecular

202
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,330
forces than, say, water.

203
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,110
Or they could just be
light molecules.

204
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,550
You could look at the physics
lectures, but kinetic energy

205
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,320
it's a function of mass
and velocity.

206
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,830
So you could have a pretty
respectable kinetic energy

207
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,880
because you have a high mass
and a low velocity.

208
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,480
So if you have a light mass and
the same kinetic energy,

209
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,905
you're more likely to have
a higher velocity.

210
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:52,150
You could watch the kinetic
energy videos for that.

211
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:57,010
But something that wants to
evaporate, a lot of its

212
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,240
molecules-- let me do it
in a different color.

213
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,860
Something that wants to
evaporate really bad, a lot

214
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,130
more of its molecules will have
to enter into this vapor

215
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,890
state in order for the
equilibrium to be reached.

216
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,370
Let me do it all in
the same color.

217
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,810
So the pressure created by its
evaporated molecules is going

218
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,900
to be higher for it to get to
that equilibrium state, so it

219
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,395
has high vapor pressure.

220
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,540
And on the other side, if you're
at a low temperature or

221
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,160
you have strong intermolecular
forces or you have a heavy

222
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,450
molecule, then you're going to
have a low vapor pressure.

223
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:50,490
For example, iron has a very
low vapor pressure because

224
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,220
it's not vaporizing while--
let me think of something.

225
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,450
Carbon dioxide has
a relatively much

226
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,620
higher vapor pressure.

227
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,460
Much more of carbon dioxide
is going to evaporate

228
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,300
when you have it.

229
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,770
Well, I really shouldn't use
that because you're going

230
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,140
straight from the liquid to the
solid state, but I think

231
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,110
you get the idea.

232
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,060
And something that has a high
vapor pressure, that wants to

233
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,120
evaporate really bad, we say
it has a high volatility.

234
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,620
You've probably heard
that word before.

235
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,390
So, for example, gasoline has a
higher-- it's more volatile

236
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,060
than water, and that's why it
evaporates, and it also has a

237
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,230
higher vapor pressure.

238
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,780
Because if you were to put it
in a closed container, more

239
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,170
gasoline at the same temperature
and the same

240
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,120
atmospheric pressure, will enter
into the vapor state.

241
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,990
And so that vapor state will
generate more pressure to

242
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:53,330
offset the natural inclination
of the gasoline to want to

243
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,750
escape than in the
case with water.

244
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,340
Now, an interesting thing
happens when this vapor

245
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,700
pressure is equal to the
atmospheric pressure.

246
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,990
So right now, this is our closed
container and you have

247
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,370
the atmosphere here at
a certain pressure.

248
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,790
Let's say until now, we've
assumed that the atmosphere

249
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,540
was at a higher pressure, for
the most part keeping these

250
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,010
molecules contained.

251
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,440
Maybe some atmosphere molecules
are coming in here,

252
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,740
and maybe some of the vapor
molecules are escaping a bit,

253
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,820
but it's keeping it contained
because this is at a higher

254
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,020
pressure out here than
this vapor pressure.

255
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,490
And of course the pressure right
here, at the surface of

256
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,700
the molecule, is going to be the
combination of the partial

257
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,900
pressure due to the few
atmospheric molecules that

258
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,060
come in, plus the
vapor pressure.

259
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,480
But once that vapor pressure
becomes equal to that

260
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,060
atmospheric pressure, so it can
press out with the same

261
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,020
amount of force-- you can kind
of view it as force per area--

262
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,260
so then the molecules
can start to escape.

263
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,490
It can push the atmosphere
back.

264
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,600
And so you start having
a gap here.

265
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,530
You start having a vacuum.

266
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,410
I don't want to use exactly
a vacuum, but since the

267
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,610
molecules escaped, more and more
of these molecules can

268
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,280
start going out.

269
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,560
And at that point, you've
reached the boiling point of

270
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,580
the substance when the vapor
pressure is equal to the

271
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,250
atmospheric pressure.

272
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,760
Just to get a sense of what all
of this means, let's look

273
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,300
at the vapor pressure
for water.

274
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,540
This is water right here, H2O.

275
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,640
I should do that in black.

276
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,190
And so you see at 760-- so
atmospheric pressure, we're in

277
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,185
torr now, but that's just a
different-- 760 torr is equal

278
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:38,310
to 1 atmosphere, so that's
about right.

279
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,610
That's about right there,
so it's 1 atmosphere.

280
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,140
So at atmospheric pressure,
the vapor pressure at 100

281
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,520
degrees Celsius for water-- the
vapor is at 100 degrees

282
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,370
Celsius for water.

283
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,330
Or I guess another way to put
it, at 100 degrees Celsius,

284
00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:00,260
you have 760 torr of vapor
pressure, which is exactly the

285
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,820
atmospheric pressure, or 1
atmosphere, at sea level.

286
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,070
So at 100 degrees, vapor
pressure is equal to

287
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,185
atmospheric, or sea
level atmospheric.

288
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,500
And so you're going to boil,
which we all know is true.

289
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,970
And then at lower temperatures,
your vapor

290
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,850
pressure is going to
be lower than the

291
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,370
atmospheric pressure, right?

292
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,780
Let's see, here it looks
like 300 something.

293
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,650
But then what happens?

294
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,590
If you lowered the atmospheric
pressure enough, if you were

295
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,370
to pump air out of the
container, or whatever, low

296
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,950
enough, so if you brought the
atmospheric pressure down to

297
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,620
this vapor pressure, then again,
you will have boiling.

298
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,390
And we saw that in the phase
change diagrams, that you can

299
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,480
boil something at a lower
temperature if you lower the

300
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,710
atmospheric pressure.

301
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,660
And that's because you're
lowering the atmospheric

302
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,070
pressure to the vapor pressure
of the substance.

303
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,360
And here's a comparative
chart, and this is

304
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,790
interesting.

305
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,670
You see this is kind of an
exponential increase with

306
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,270
temperature of vapor pressure.

307
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,760
And that's because, if you think
about that distribution

308
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,850
we did before, this is at
one kinetic energy.

309
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,660
If you increase the amount of
kinetic energy, then your

310
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,100
distribution will
look like this.

311
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,620
The temperature has gone up.

312
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,770
And now you have a
lot, lot more.

313
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,650
It's not just linear.

314
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,890
You have a lot more particles
that can now escape and have

315
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,620
the kinetic energy
to evaporate.

316
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,720
And you can see it's this
exponential increase as you

317
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,030
increase the temperature.

318
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,060
Now, here's another chart.

319
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,990
You say, hey, where's that
exponential increase going?

320
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,990
That's because this is
a logarithmic chart.

321
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,880
You can see the scale.

322
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,110
It increases exponentially as
opposed to linearly, so it

323
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,530
goes from 0.1 to 10, so equal
distances are actually up by a

324
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,010
factor of 10, so that's
why you don't see

325
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,600
that logarithmic move.

326
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,860
But these are just for
different substances.

327
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,390
Propane, you see at any given--
so let's go at like a

328
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,160
decent temperature.

329
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,472
Let's go 20 degrees Celsius.

330
00:15:56,472 --> 00:16:02,940
At 20 Celsius, propane has the
highest vapor pressure.

331
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,310
So this is 1 atmosphere, so
propane will actually

332
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,615
evaporate, will actually boil
at 20 degrees Celsius.

333
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:13,440
It will actually completely
boil and go

334
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,520
into the gaseous state.

335
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,410
Because its vapor pressure
is so much higher than

336
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,470
atmospheric pressure, if we're
assuming we're at sea level.

337
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,910
And you could do that for
different molecules.

338
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,730
Methyl chloride is
the next one.

339
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,430
It's a slightly lower
vapor pressure,

340
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,250
but still very volatile.

341
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,660
It would still definitely boil
and turn into the gaseous

342
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,390
state at 20 degrees Celsius if
we're at sea level because sea

343
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,330
level is right there.

344
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,150
Let's see, at sea level, if you
wanted to keep something--

345
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,750
so sea level is this pressure--
if you wanted to

346
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,010
keep let's say, methyl
chloride.

347
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,980
If you wanted to keep methyl
chloride in the liquid state,

348
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,170
or in equilibrium with the
liquid state instead of

349
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,580
boiling, you would have
to be at least at

350
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,240
around-- what is this?

351
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,010
Minus 25 degrees Celsius
in order for that.

352
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,430
Propane, even at minus 25
degrees is still in the

353
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,290
gaseous state because its vapor

354
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,480
pressure is still higher.

355
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,140
And then, of course, if you
have butane, for example.

356
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:17,720
Butane I think is what they put
in lighters, but butane

357
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,550
will be in the liquid state as
long as you're at around

358
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,720
roughly 0 degrees.

359
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,560
In a lighter, you might say,
oh, it's in a liquid state.

360
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,140
They probably increase the
pressure so the pressure in

361
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,680
the lighter is probably
something higher.

362
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,930
Maybe it's at 2 atmospheres or
something, so that the butane

363
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,940
at room temperature will stay
in the liquid state.

364
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,220
Who knows?

365
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,160
I don't know what the pressure
is in there.

366
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,930
This is just an interesting
chart to look at, that there's

367
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,690
actually a bunch of different
vapor pressures.

368
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,870
You can see at atmospheric
pressure what's likely to be a

369
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,060
gas or a liquid at different
temperatures, and then you

370
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,310
could see at different
temperatures, which are the

371
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,440
things that are most volatile
and how much do you have to

372
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,000
increase or decrease the
pressure to evaporate

373
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,280
something or to boil it.

374
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,820
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

375
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,260
Vapor pressure is something that
we encounter every day,

376
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,660
and I'll see you in
the next video.
