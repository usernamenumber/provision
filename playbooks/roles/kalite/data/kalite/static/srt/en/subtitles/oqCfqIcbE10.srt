1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,917
Let's take the indefinite integral of the square root of 7x plus 9 dx.

2
00:00:07,917 --> 00:00:14,166
So my first question to you is is this going to be a good case for u-substitution?

3
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:21,002
When you look here, we maybe the natural thing to set to be equal to u is 7x plus 9,

4
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,671
but do I see its derivative anywhere over here?

5
00:00:24,671 --> 00:00:33,504
Let's see, we set u to be equal to 7x plus 9, what is the derivative of u with respect to x going to be?

6
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:37,219
Derivative of u with respect to x is just going to be equal to 7.

7
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:44,001
Derivative of 7x is 7, derivative of 9 is 0. So do we see a seven lying around anywhere over here?

8
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:53,482
Well, we don't. But what would could we do in order to have a seven lying around, but not change the value of the integral?

9
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:57,250
Well, the neat thing and we see this multiple times is when you're evaluating integrals,

10
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,336
scalars can go in and outside of the integral very easily.

11
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:05,648
Just to remind ourselves that if I have the integral of,

12
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:12,585
let's say some scalar a times f(x) (f of x) dx, this is the same thing as

13
00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:20,085
a times the integral of f(x) (f of x) dx. That the integral of the scalar times the function is equal to

14
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:25,182
the scalar times the integral of the function. So let me put this aside right over here.

15
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:31,372
So with that in mind, can we multiply and divide by something that will have a 7 showing up?

16
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:39,578
Well, we can multiply and divide by 7. So imagine doing this. Let's rewrite our original integral --

17
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:42,578
so let me draw a little arrow here just to go around that aside.

18
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:46,224
We could write our original integral as being equal to the integral

19
00:01:46,224 --> 00:01:57,976
of 1/7 times 7 times the square root of 7x plus 9 dx.

20
00:01:57,976 --> 00:02:01,312
And if we want to, we could take the 1/7 outside of the integral,

21
00:02:01,312 --> 00:02:03,105
we don't have to, but we could rewrite this as

22
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:12,180
1/7 times the integral of 7 times the square root of 7x plus 9 dx.

23
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,981
So now, if we said, "u is equal to 7x plus 9," do we have its derivative laying around?

24
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:23,114
Well, sure! The 7 is right over here. We know that du, if we want to write it in differential form,

25
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:35,849
du is equal to 7 times dx. So du is equal 7 times dx. That part right there is equal to du,

26
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,180
and if we want to care about u, well that's just going to be the 7x plus 9.

27
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,504
That is our u. So let's rewrite this entire integral in terms of u.

28
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:53,191
It's going to be equal to 1/7 times the integral of --

29
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:56,270
and I'll just take the 7 and put it in the back so we could just write

30
00:02:56,283 --> 00:03:05,912
the square root of u du. Seven times dx is du.

31
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:11,316
And, we can rewrite this if we want as u to the 1/2 power; makes it a little bit easier

32
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:16,879
for us to kind of do the reverse power rule here. So we can rewrite this is equal to

33
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:25,030
1/7 times the integral of u to the 1/2 power du. And let me just make it clear.

34
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,952
This u I could have written it in white; I want the same color in this du is the same du right over here.

35
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:35,641
So what is the anti-derivative of u to the 1/2 power?

36
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:40,581
Well, we increment u's power by 1, so this is going to be equal to --

37
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:43,237
and let me not forget this 1/7 out front.

38
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:49,462
So it's going to be 1/7 times -- if we increment the power here, it's going to be

39
00:03:49,462 --> 00:04:06,318
u to the 3/2 (1/2 plus 1 is 1 1/2 or 3/2), and we're going to multiply this new thing times the reciprocal of 3/2,

40
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:14,835
which is 2/3. And I encourage you to verify that derivative 2/3 * u^(3/2) is indeed u^(1/2).

41
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:19,380
And so we have that and since we're multiplying 1/7 times this entire indefinite integral,

42
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,350
we could also throw in a plus C right over here that might be a constant,

43
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:36,130
and if we want, we can distribute the 1/7. So it would get 1/7 times 2/3 is (2/21)u^(3/2),

44
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,243
and 1/7 times some constant, well that's just going to be some constant,

45
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:44,539
so I could write a constant like that; I could call it C1, and I could call this C2,

46
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:48,972
but it really is some arbitrary constant. And we're done -- oh, actually no we aren't done.

47
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:54,789
We still just have our entire thing in terms of u. So now let's un-substitute it.

48
00:04:54,789 --> 00:05:03,760
So this is going to be equal to 2/21 times u^(3/2) -- and we already know what u is equal to,

49
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,779
u is equal to 7x plus 9. Let me put in a new color here just to ease the monotony.

50
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:22,453
So it's going to be 2/21 times 7x plus 9 to the 3/2 power plus C.

51
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:26,478
And we are done! We're able to take a kind of hairy looking integral and realize

52
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,478
that even though it wasn't completely obvious at first, u-substitution is applicable.
