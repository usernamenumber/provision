1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Move the orange dot to -2 + 2i.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have a complex number here.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It has a real part: -2.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It has an imaginary part of 2 times i.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what you will see here is we're going to plot it

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on this kind of two-dimensional grid.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But these are not traditional coordinate axes.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In our traditional coordinate axes,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you're plotting a real x value versus a real y value.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Here, the horizontal axis –

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's going to represent the real part of our complex number.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And our vertical axis is going to represent the imaginary part.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So in our complex number, our real part is -2.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then our imaginary part is positive 2.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so that right over there

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the complex plane is the point -2 + 2i.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's do a few more of these.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 5 + 2i.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Once again, the real part is 5.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Imaginary part is 2

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're done.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's do two more of these.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1 + 5i.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1 – that's the real part – plus 5i right over that 'Im' label.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Alright. Let's do one more of these

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4 -4i.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The real part is 4.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Imaginary part is -4.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're done.
