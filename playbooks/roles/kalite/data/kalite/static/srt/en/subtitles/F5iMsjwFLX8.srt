1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,790
Simplify 3 times the square
root of 200x to the third.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,130
So a good place to start,
let's factor out 200.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:15,170
So if I'm just focusing on the
200 here, 200 is 2 times 100.

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,390
And 100 is a perfect square.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,950
It's 10 times 10.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,910
And then if we were to factor
x to the third, that's the

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,695
same thing as x squared
times x.

9
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,060
So let's write that out.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,080
So let me just rewrite.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,210
This whole thing is equal to 3
times the square root-- I'll

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,480
write it all under one big
radical sign right now-- of 2

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,890
times 100 times x
squared times x.

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,610
Stretch the radical sign.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,490
So the x squared times x,
that is x to the third.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,070
And then the 200
is 2 times 100.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,370
Now, we can you think of this
as all of these numbers, the

18
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,860
product of all these numbers to
the 1/2 power or taking the

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,320
square root of the product,
that's like taking the square

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,130
root of-- or that's equivalent
to-- taking the square root of

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:09,090
each of these terms. So this
is going to be equal to 3

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,240
times the square root of 2 times
the square root of 100

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,370
times the square root of
x squared times the

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,620
square root of x.

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,650
   

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,200
These terms right there
in blue, that's

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,000
these terms right there.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,200
The terms in orange, that's
those terms right over there.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,170
Now, several of these are not
too hard to evaluate.

30
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,370
So we have our 3 out front.

31
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,410
So this is going to
be equal to 3.

32
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,990
And then let me mark off the
terms. Let's do this one the

33
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,460
first.

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,030
What's the square root of 100?

35
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,880
Or the principal root of 100?

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,890
The positive square root.

37
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,580
Well it's 10.

38
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,160
10 times 10 is 100.

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,950
It's going to be 3 times 10.

40
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,570
That's that term right there.

41
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,570
And then, what is the square
root of x squared?

42
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,790
Well it's just x. x times
x is x squared.

43
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,840
So times x.

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,130
And then we have to deal-- so
we've dealt with that, we've

45
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,390
dealt with that, we've
dealt with that.

46
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,940
And then we have these two
terms right here where we

47
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,080
can't take the square roots.

48
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,320
So we could say times the square
root of 2 times the

49
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,100
square root of x.

50
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,180
So this term right here times
the square root of 2.

51
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,860
And then, finally, out here
times the square root of x.

52
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,990
So if we want to simplify this
fully, we'd get 3 times 10

53
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,540
times x, which is 30x.

54
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,090
And then we could actually
merge these.

55
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,960
The square root of 2 times
the square root of x.

56
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,950
That's the same thing as
the square root of 2x.

57
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,890
So we could say times the
square root of 2x.

58
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,980
And we have simplified this
as far as it can go.
