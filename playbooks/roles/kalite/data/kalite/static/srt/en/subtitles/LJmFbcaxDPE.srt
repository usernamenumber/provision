1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
SAL: Let's say I have
some weak acid.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,770
I'll call it HA.

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:12,030
A is a place holder for really a
whole set of elements that I

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,590
could put there.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,340
It could be fluorine, it could
be an ammonia molecule.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,400
If you add H it becomes
ammonium.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,090
So this isn't any particular
element I'm talking about.

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,170
This is just kind of a general
way of writing an acid.

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:31,330
And let's say it's in
equilibrium with, of course,

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,520
and you've seen this multiple
times, a proton.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,846
And all of this is in
an aqueous solution.

13
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:39,350
   

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,080
Between this proton jumping
off of this and

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,300
its conjugate base.

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:44,820
A minus.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,510
And we also could have written
a base equilibrium, where we

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,370
say the conjugate base could
disassociate, or it could

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,770
essentially grab a hydrogen from
the water and create OH.

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,170
And we've done that
multiple times.

21
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,970
But that's not the point
of this video.

22
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,160
So let's just think a little bit
about what would happen to

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,580
this equilibrium if we were
to stress it in some way.

24
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,780
And you can already imagine that
I'm about to touch on Le

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,410
Chatelier's Principal, which
essentially just says, look,

26
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,850
if you stress an equilibrium
in any way, the equilibrium

27
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,930
moves in such a way to
relieve that stress.

28
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:28,755
So let's say that the stress
that I apply to the system--

29
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,870
Let me do a different color.

30
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,990
I'm going to add some
strong base.

31
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,100
That's too dark.

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,490
I'm going to add some NaOH.

33
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,240
And we know this is a strong
base when you put it in a

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,050
aqueous solultion, the sodium
part just kind of

35
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,570
disassociates, but the more
important thing, you have all

36
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,030
this OH in the solution, which
wants to grab hydrogens away.

37
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,860
So when you add this OH to the
solution, what's going to

38
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,720
happen for every mole that you
add, not even just mole, for

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,250
every molecule you add of this
into the solution, it's going

40
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,900
to eat up a molecule
of hydrogen.

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,190
Right?

42
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,360
So for example, if you had 1
mole oh hydrogen molecules in

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,140
your solution and you added 1
mole of sodium hydroxide to

44
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,270
your solution, right when you do
that, all this is going to

45
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,530
react with all of that.

46
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,790
And the OHs are going to react
with the Hs and form water,

47
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,320
and they'll both just kind of
disappear into the solution.

48
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,390
They didn't disappear, they
all turned into water.

49
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,220
And so all of this hydrogen
will go away.

50
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,160
Or at least the hydrogen that
was initially there.

51
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,890
That 1 mole of hydrogens
will disappear.

52
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,980
So what should happen
to this reaction?

53
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,690
Well, know this is an
equilibrium reaction.

54
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:49,470
So as these hydrogen disappear,
because this is an

55
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,200
equilibrium reaction or because
this is a weak base,

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,130
more of this is going to be
converted into these two

57
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,110
products to kind of make up
for that loss of hydrogen.

58
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,160
And you can even play
with it on the math.

59
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,920
So this hydrogen goes down
initially, and then it starts

60
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,700
getting to equilibrium
very fast.

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,600
But this is going to go down.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,770
This is going to go up.

63
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,540
And then this is going
to go down less.

64
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,520
Because sure, when you put the
sodium hydroxide there, it

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,270
just ate up all of
the hydrogens.

66
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,930
But then you have this-- you can
kind of view as the spare

67
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,440
hydrogen capacity here
to produce hydrogens.

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,010
And when these disappear,
this weak base will

69
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,950
disassociate more.

70
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,460
The equilibrium we'll move
more in this direction.

71
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,190
So immediately, this will
eat all of that.

72
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,010
But then when the equilibrium
moves in that direction, a lot

73
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,040
of the hydrogen will
be replaced.

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,840
So if you think about what's
happening, if I just threw

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,350
this sodium hydroxide
in water.

76
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,470
So if I just did NaOH in an
aqueous solution-- so that's

77
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,120
just throwing it in water-- that
disassociates completely

78
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:05,260
into the sodium cation
and hydroxide anion.

79
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,810
   

80
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,540
So you all of a sudden
immediately increase the

81
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,320
quantity of OHs by essentially
the number of moles of sodium

82
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,060
hydroxide you're adding,
and you'd immediately

83
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,089
increase the pH, right?

84
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,470
Remember.

85
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,510
When you increase the amount of
OH, you would decrease the

86
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,940
pOH, right?

87
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,975
And that's just because
it's the negative log.

88
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:34,700
So if you increase OH, you're
decreasing pOH, and you're

89
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,220
increasing pH.

90
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,170
And just think OH-- you're
making it more basic.

91
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,530
And a high pH is also
very basic.

92
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,360
If you have a mole of this, you
end up with a pH of 14.

93
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,790
And if you had a strong acid,
not a strong base, you would

94
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,490
end up with a pH of 0.

95
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,300
Hopefully you're getting a
little bit familiar with that

96
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,860
concept right now, but if it
confuses you, just play around

97
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,260
with the logs a little bit and
you'll eventually get it.

98
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,780
But just to get back to the
point, if you just did this in

99
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,150
water, you immediately get a
super high pH because the OH

100
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,290
concentration goes
through the roof.

101
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,220
But if you do it here-- if you
apply the sodium hydroxide to

102
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,750
this solution, the solution that
contains a weak acid and

103
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,400
it's conjugate base, the weak
acid and its conjugate base,

104
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,690
what happens?

105
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,320
Sure, it immediately reacts with
all of this hydrogen and

106
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,090
eats it all up.

107
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,740
And then you have this extras
supply here that just keeps

108
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,300
providing more and
more hydrogens.

109
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,200
And it'll make up a
lot of the loss.

110
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,760
So essentially, the stress
won't be as bad.

111
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,670
And over here, you dramatically
increase the pH

112
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,130
when you just throw
it on water.

113
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,150
Here, you're going to increase
the pH by a lot less.

114
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,690
And in future videos, will
actually do the math of how

115
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,930
much less it's increasing
the pH.

116
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,800
But the way you could think
about it is, this is kind of a

117
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,390
shock absorber for pH.

118
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,500
Even though you threw this
strong based into this

119
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,660
solution, it didn't increase
the pH as much as you would

120
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,540
have expected.

121
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,620
And you can make it
the other way.

122
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,320
If I just wrote this exact
same reaction as a basic

123
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,040
reaction-- and remember,
this is the same thing.

124
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,360
So if I just wrote this as, A
minus-- so I just wrote its

125
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,720
conjugate base-- is in
equilibrium with the conjugate

126
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,760
base grabbing some
water from the

127
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,640
surrounding aqueous solution.

128
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,850
Everything we're dealing
with right now

129
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,480
is an aqueous solution.

130
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,830
And of course that water that
it grabbed from is not going

131
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,360
to be an OH.

132
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,880
Remember, are just equivalent
reactions.

133
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,020
Here, I'm writing it as
an acidic reaction.

134
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,600
Here, I'm writing it is
a basic reaction.

135
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,060
But they're equivalent.

136
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,470
Now.

137
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,470
If you were to add a strong
acid to the solution, what

138
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,390
would happen?

139
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,460
So if I were to throw hydrogen
chloride into this.

140
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,920
Well hydrogen chloride, if you
just throw it into straight up

141
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,350
water without the solution, it
would completely disassociate

142
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,530
into a bunch of hydrogens and
a bunch of chlorine anions.

143
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,120
   

144
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,110
And it would immediately
make it very acidic.

145
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,270
You would get to
a very low pH.

146
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,510
If you had a mole of this-- if
your concentration was 1

147
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,380
molar, then this will
go to a pH of 0.

148
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,360
But what happens if you at
hydrochloric acid to this

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,450
solution right here?

150
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,750
This one that has this
weak base and its

151
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,160
conjugate weak acid?

152
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,350
Well, all of these hydrogen
protons that disassociate from

153
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,380
the hydrochloric acid are all
going to react with these OHs

154
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,280
you have here.

155
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,670
And they're just going to
cancel each other out.

156
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,820
They're just going to merge with
these and turn into water

157
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,050
and become part of the
aqueous solution.

158
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,280
So this, the OHs are going to
go down initially, but then

159
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,220
you have this reserve
of weak base here.

160
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,690
And Le Chatelier's Principal
tells us.

161
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,370
Look, if we have a stressor that
is decreasing our overall

162
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,640
concentration of OH, then the
reaction is going to move in

163
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,290
the direction that relieves
that stress.

164
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,930
So the reaction is going to
go in that direction.

165
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,180
So you're going to have more of
our weak base turning into

166
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,260
a weak acid and producing
more OH.

167
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,760
So the pH won't go down as much
as you would expect if

168
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,020
you just threw this in water.

169
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,100
This is going to lower the pH,
but then you have more OH that

170
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,420
could be produced as this guy
grabs more and more hydrogens

171
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,450
from the water.

172
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,310
So the way to think about it is
it's kind of like a cushion

173
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,150
or a spring in terms of what a
strong acid or base could do

174
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,580
to the solution.

175
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,084
And that's why it's
called a buffer.

176
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:38,890
   

177
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,780
Because it provides a
cushion on acidity.

178
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,670
If you add a strong base to
water, you immediately

179
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,840
increase its pH.

180
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,990
Or you decrease its acidity
dramatically.

181
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,665
But if you add a strong base
to a buffer, because of Le

182
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,940
Chatelier's Principal,
essentially, you're not going

183
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,430
to affect the pH as much.

184
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,040
Same thing.

185
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,650
If you add and acid to that same
buffer, it's not going to

186
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,880
affect the pH as much as you
would have expected if you had

187
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,860
thrown that acid in water
because the equilibrium

188
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,070
reaction can always kind of
refill the amount of OH that

189
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,420
you lost if you're adding acid,
or it can refill the

190
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,090
amount of hydrogen you lost
if you're adding a base.

191
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,190
And that's why it's
called buffer.

192
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,090
It provides a cushion.

193
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,250
So it give some stability
to the solution's pH.

194
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,440
   

195
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,410
The definition of a buffer is
just a solution of a weak acid

196
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,450
in equilibrium with its
conjugate weak base.

197
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,460
That's what a buffer is, and
it's called a buffer because

198
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,450
it provides you this kind
of cushion of pH.

199
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,580
It's kind of a stress absorber,
or a shock absorber

200
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,500
for the acidity of a solution.

201
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,710
Now, with that said, let's
explore a little bit the math

202
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,090
of a buffer, which is really
just the math of a weak acid.

203
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,580
So if we rewrite the equation
again, so HA is in

204
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,150
equilibrium.

205
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,170
Everything's in an
aqueous solution.

206
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:11,330
With hydrogen and its
conjugate base.

207
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,530
We know that there's an
equilibrium constant for this.

208
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,620
We've done many videos
on that.

209
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,400
The equilibrium constant here is
equal to the concentration

210
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,830
of our hydrogen proton times
the concentration of our

211
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,740
conjugate base.

212
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,390
When I say concentration,
I'm talking molarity.

213
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,710
Moles per liter divided by the

214
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,020
concentration of our weak acid.

215
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,270
Now.

216
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,485
   

217
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:44,520
Let's solve for hydrogen
concentration.

218
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,330
Because what I want to do is I
want to figure out a formula,

219
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,780
and we'll call it the
Hendersen-Hasselbalch Formula,

220
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,630
which a lot of books want you
to memorize, which I don't

221
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,210
think you should.

222
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,430
I think you should always just
be able to go from this kind

223
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,910
of basic assumption
and get to it.

224
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,240
But let's solve for the hydrogen
so we can figure out

225
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,810
a relationship between pH and
all the other stuff that's in

226
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,460
this formula.

227
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,460
So, if we want to solve for
hydrogen, we can multiply both

228
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,180
sides by the reciprocal
of this right here.

229
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,060
And you get hydrogen
concentration.

230
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,280
Ka times-- I'm multiplying
both sides times a

231
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,300
reciprocal of that.

232
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,340
So times the concentration of
our weak acid divided by the

233
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:32,050
concentration of our weak base
is equal to our concentration

234
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,410
of our hydrogen.

235
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,690
Fair enough.

236
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,090
Now.

237
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,890
Let's take the negative
log of both sides.

238
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:50,590
So the negative log of all of
that stuff, of your acidic

239
00:11:50,590 --> 00:12:01,640
equilibrium constant, times HA,
our weak acid divided by

240
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,540
our weak base, is equal to the
negative log of our hydrogen

241
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,340
concentration.

242
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,000
Which is just our pH, right?

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,500
Negative log of hydrogen
concentration is-- that's the

244
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,070
definition of pH.

245
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,240
I'll write the p and the
H in different colors.

246
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,790
You know a p just means
negative log.

247
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,210
Minus log.

248
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:22,580
That's all.

249
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,770
Base 10.

250
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,250
Let's see if we can simplify
this any more.

251
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,670
So our logarithmic properties.

252
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,140
We know that when you take the
log of something and you

253
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,370
multiply it, that's the same
thing as taking the log of

254
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,000
this plus the log of that.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:49,370
So this can to be simplified to
minus log of our Ka minus

256
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:57,340
the log our weak acid
concentration divided by its

257
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,100
conjugate base concentration.

258
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,880
Is equal to the pH.

259
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:09,175
Now, this is just the pKa of our
weak acid, which is just

260
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:12,990
the negative log of its
equilibrium constant.

261
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,000
So this is just the pKa.

262
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,740
And the minus log
of HA over A.

263
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,830
What we can do is we could make
this a plus, and just

264
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,820
take this to the
minus 1 power.

265
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,100
Right?

266
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,600
That's just another logarithm
property, and you can review

267
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,780
the logarithm videos if
that confused you.

268
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,980
And this to the minus 1 power
just means invert this.

269
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,120
So we could say, plus the
logarithm of our conjugate

270
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,980
base concentration divided by
the weak acid concentration is

271
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,450
equal to the pH.

272
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,110
And this right here,
this is called the

273
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,250
Hendersen-Hasselbalch
Equation.

274
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,240
And I really encourage you
not to memorize it.

275
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,520
Because if you do attempt to
memorize it, within a few

276
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,220
hours, you're going to
forget whether this

277
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,900
was a plus over here.

278
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,010
You're going to forget this,
and you're going to forget

279
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,190
whether you put the A minus or
the HA on the numerator or the

280
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,990
demoninator, and if you forget
that, it's fatal.

281
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,140
The better thing is to just
start from your base

282
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,470
assumptions.

283
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,000
And trust me.

284
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,100
It took me a couple minutes to
do it, but if you just do it

285
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,170
really fast on paper-- you don't
have to talk it through

286
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,920
the way I did-- it'll take
in no time at all to

287
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,120
come to this equation.

288
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,520
It's much better than memorizing
it, and you won't

289
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,770
forget it when you're
30 years old.

290
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,590
But what's useful about this?

291
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:29,550
Well, it immediately relates pH
to our pKa, and this is a

292
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,900
constant, right, for
an equilibrium?

293
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,110
Plus the log of the ratios
between the acid and the

294
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,340
conjugate base.

295
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,240
So the more conjugate base I
have, and the less acid I

296
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,940
have, the more my pH is
going to increase.

297
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,130
Right?

298
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,740
If this goes up and this
is going down, my

299
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,740
pH is going to increase.

300
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,780
Which makes sense
because I have

301
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,390
more base in the solution.

302
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,700
And if I have the inverse of
that, might be just going--
