1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,580
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,930
I will now introduce you to
the concept of momentum.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,800
And the letter for momentum is,
in physics, or at least in

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,230
mechanics, it's the letter P.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,890
P for momentum.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,010
And I assume that's because the
letter M has already been

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,200
used for mass, which
is I guess an even

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,400
more fundamental idea.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,280
So P for momentum.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,180
So what is momentum?

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,030
Well, you probably have
a general idea of it.

12
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,740
If you see a big guy running
really fast, they'll say, he

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,990
has a lot of momentum.

14
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,440
And if there's a big guy running
really fast and a

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,940
small guy running really fast,
most people would say, well,

16
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,530
the big guy has more momentum.

17
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,980
Maybe they don't have a
quantitative sense of why

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,040
they're saying that, but
they just feel that

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,910
that must be true.

20
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,070
And if we look at the definition
of momentum, it'll

21
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,730
make sense.

22
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:50,450
The definition of momentum is
equal to mass times velocity.

23
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,060
So something with, say, a
medium mass and a huge

24
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,400
velocity is going to have
a big momentum.

25
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,340
Or something with maybe a medium
mass, but-- the other

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:00:59,770
way around.

27
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,860
I forgot what I just said.

28
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,230
So medium mass and big velocity,
huge momentum, or

29
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:03,940
the other way around.

30
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,280
Huge mass, medium velocity
would have maybe the same

31
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,230
momentum, but it would still
have a big momentum.

32
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,910
Or another way of doing momentum
is how little you

33
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,050
would like to be in the way of
that object as it passes by.

34
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,610
How unpleasant would it be
to be hit by that object?

35
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,060
That's a good way of thinking
about momentum.

36
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,603
So momentum is mass
times velocity.

37
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,480
So how does it relate
to everything we've

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,420
been learning so far?

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:41,270
So we know that force is equal
to mass times acceleration.

40
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,030
And what's acceleration?

41
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,420
Well acceleration is just
change in velocity.

42
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:52,580
So we also know that force is
equal to mass times change in

43
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,850
velocity per unit
of time, right?

44
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,890
Per change in time.

45
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,720
T for time.

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,550
So force is also equal
to-- well, mass

47
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,290
times change in velocity.

48
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,039
Mass, let's assume that
mass doesn't change.

49
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,000
So that could also be viewed
as the change in mass times

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,300
velocity in the unit
amount of time.

51
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,130
And this is a little tricky
here, I said, you know, the

52
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,960
mass times the change in
velocity, that's the same

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,230
thing as the change in the
mass times the velocity,

54
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,160
assuming the mass
doesn't change.

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,960
And here we have mass times
velocity, which is momentum.

56
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,310
So force can also be
viewed as change in

57
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,026
momentum per unit of time.

58
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,420
And I'll introduce
you to another

59
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,810
concept called impulse.

60
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,990
And impulse kind of means
what you think it means.

61
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,640
An impulse is defined
as force times time.

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,980
And I just want to introduce
this to you just in case you

63
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,760
see it on the exam or whatever,
show you it's not a

64
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,010
difficult concept.

65
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,120
So force times change in time,
or time, if you assume time

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,670
starts at time 0.

67
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,805
But force times change in time
is equal to impulse.

68
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:04,430
I actually don't know-- I should
look up what letters

69
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,720
they use for impulse.

70
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,490
But another way of viewing
impulse is force

71
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,360
times change in time.

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,960
Well that's the same thing as
change in momentum over change

73
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,840
in time times change in time.

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,110
Right?

75
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,160
Because this is just the
same thing as force.

76
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,210
And that's just change
in momentum, so

77
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,460
that's impulse as well.

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,940
And the unit of impulse
is the joule.

79
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,450
And we'll go more into
the joule when we do

80
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,200
work in all of that.

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,500
And if this confuses you, don't
worry about it too much.

82
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,050
The main thing about momentum is
that you realize it's mass

83
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,100
times velocity.

84
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,700
And since force is change in
momentum per unit of time, if

85
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,220
you don't have any external
forces on a system or, on say,

86
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,960
on a set of objects, their
combined, or their net

87
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,070
momentum won't change.

88
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,550
And that comes from
Newton's Laws.

89
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,260
The only way you can get a
combined change in momentum is

90
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,150
if you have some type of net
force acting on the system.

91
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,770
So with that in mind,
let's do some

92
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,340
momentum problems. Whoops.

93
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,330
Invert colors.

94
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,450
OK.

95
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,470
So let's say we have a car.

96
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,029
Say it's a car.

97
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,860
Let me do some more interesting
colors.

98
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,340
A car with a magenta bottom.

99
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,390
And it is, let's see, what
does this problem say?

100
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:31,100
It's 1,000 kilograms. So
a little over a ton.

101
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,410
And it's moving at 9 meters
per second east. So its

102
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,550
velocity is equal to 9 meters
per second east, or to the

103
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,290
right in this example.

104
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,460
And it strikes a stationary
2, 000 kilogram truck.

105
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,710
So here's my truck.

106
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,450
Here's my truck and this is
a 2,000 kilogram truck.

107
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,580
And it's stationary, so
the velocity is 0.

108
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,330
And when the car hits the truck,
let's just say that it

109
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,600
somehow gets stuck in the truck
and they just both keep

110
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,740
moving together.

111
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,340
So they get stuck together.

112
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,640
The question is, what is the
resulting speed of the

113
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,050
combination truck and car
after the collision?

114
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,190
Well, all we have to do is
think about what is the

115
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,120
combined momentum before
the collision?

116
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,610
Well let's see.

117
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,800
The momentum of the car is going
to be the mass times the

118
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,850
car-- mass of the car.

119
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,530
Well the total momentum is going
to be the mass of the car

120
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:43,180
times the velocity of the car
plus the mass of the truck

121
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,250
times the velocity
of the truck.

122
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,220
And this is before they
hit each other.

123
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,370
So what's the mass of the car?

124
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,660
That's 1,000.

125
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,760
What's the velocity
of the car?

126
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,370
It's 9 meters per second.

127
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,110
So as you can imagine, a unit of
momentum would be kilogram

128
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,130
meters per second.

129
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,990
So it's 1,000 times 9 kilogram
meters per second, but I won't

130
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,950
write that right now just to
keep things simple, or so I

131
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,960
save space.

132
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,575
And then the mass of
the truck is 2,000.

133
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:10,735
And what's its velocity?

134
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:11,540
Well, it's 0.

135
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,480
It's stationary initially.

136
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,380
So the initial momentum of the
system-- this is 2,000 times

137
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:24,080
0-- is 9,000 plus 0, which
equals 9,000 kilogram meters

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,090
per second.

139
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,440
That's the momentum before
the car hits

140
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,970
the back of the truck.

141
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,170
Now what happens after the car
hits the back of the truck?

142
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,520
So let's go to that situation.

143
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,230
So we have the truck.

144
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,860
I'll draw it a little
less neatly.

145
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,050
And then you have the car and
it's probably a little bit--

146
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,040
well, I won't go into whether
it's banged up and whether it

147
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
released heat and all of that.

148
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,060
Let's assume that there was
nothing-- if this is a simple

149
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,830
problem that we can do.

150
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,700
So if we assume that,
there would be

151
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,990
no change in momentum.

152
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,410
Because we're saying that
there's no net forces acting

153
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,010
on the system.

154
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,910
And when I say system, I
mean the combination of

155
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,410
the car and the truck.

156
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,580
So what we're saying is, is
this combination, this new

157
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,100
vehicle called a car truck, its
momentum will have to be

158
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,070
the same as the car and the
truck's momentum when they

159
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,600
were separate.

160
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,780
So what do we know about
this car truck object?

161
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,330
Well we know its new mass.

162
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,050
The car truck object,
it will be the

163
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,290
combined mass of the two.

164
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,550
So it's 1,000 kilograms plus
2,000 kilograms. So it's 3,000

165
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,690
kilograms. And now we can use
that information to figure out

166
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,510
its velocity.

167
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,190
How?

168
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,300
Well, its momentum-- this
3,000 kilogram object's

169
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,440
momentum-- has to be the same
as the momentum of the two

170
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,510
objects before the collision.

171
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,230
So it still has to be 9,000
kilogram meters per second.

172
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,300
So once again, mass
times velocity.

173
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,120
So mass is 3,000 times
the new velocity.

174
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,580
So we could call that, I don't
know, new velocity, v sub n.

175
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,200
That will equal 9,000.

176
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,870
Because momentum is conserved.

177
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,390
That's what you always
have to remember.

178
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,630
Momentum doesn't change unless
there's a net force acting on

179
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,030
the system.

180
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,110
Because we saw a force is change
in momentum per time.

181
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,670
So if you have no force
in it, you have

182
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,626
no change in momentum.

183
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:17,870
So let's just solve.

184
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,990
Divide both sides of this by
3,000 and you get the new

185
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,460
velocity is 3 meters
per second.

186
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,490
And that kind of makes sense.

187
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,840
You have a relatively light
car moving at 9 meters per

188
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,080
second and a stationary truck.

189
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,299
Then it smacks the truck
and they move together.

190
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,690
The combined object-- and it's
going to be to the east. And

191
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,970
we'll do more later, but we
assume that a positive

192
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,310
velocity is east. If somehow we
ended up with a negative,

193
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,040
it would have been west. But it
makes sense because we have

194
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,590
a light object and a stationery,
heavy object.

195
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,590
And when the light object hits
the stationery, heavy object,

196
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,510
the combined objects still keeps
moving to the right, but

197
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,010
it moves at a relatively
slower speed.

198
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,660
So hopefully that gives you a
little bit of intuition for

199
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,350
momentum, and that was not too
confusing of a problem.

200
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,170
And in the next couple of
videos, I'll do more momentum

201
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,430
problems and then I'll introduce
you to momentum

202
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,350
problems in two dimensions.

203
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,450
I will see you soon.
