00:00:00,207 --> 00:00:08,013
We're asked to graph y = 5 to the x power. And we'll just do this the most basic way.

2
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:11,602
We'll just try out some values for x and see what we get for y,

3
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:14,430
and then we'll plot with those coordinates.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,536
So let's try some negative and some positive values

5
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:22,604
and I'll try to center them around zero, so this will be my x values, and this will be my y values.

6
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:26,204
Let's start first with something reasonably negative, but not too negative,

7
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:35,537
So let's say we start with x = -2. Then y = 5^x or 5^-2,
