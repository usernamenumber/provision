00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:03,784
Find the domain of f(x) is equal to the principal

2
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:07,225
square root of 2x - 8

3
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:10,501
So the domain of a function is just a set of all the possible

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:12,554
valid inputs into the function

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:16,867
or all of the possible values for which the function is defined

6
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:20,502
And when we look at how the function is defined right over here

7
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:22,067
It is a square root. The principal square root of 2x-8

8
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:28,559
It's only going to be defined when its taking the principal square root of a non-negative number

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:37,533
and so 2x-8 is only going to be defined when 2x-8 is greater than or equal to zero

10
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:40,387
It can be zero because the square root of zero is zero

11
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:44,571
It can be positive. But if this was negative then all of a sudden this principal

12
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:48,074
square root function which we are just assuming is just the "plain vanilla" one

13
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:51,019
for real numbers would not be defined

14
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:59,769
So this function definition is only defined when 2x-8 is greater than or equal to zero

15
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:02,882
and then we can say if 2x-8 has to be greater than or equal to zero we can solve this

16
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:06,149
inequality to see what it is saying about what x has to be

17
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,285
So if we add 8 to both sides of this inequality you get

18
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:14,638
(these eights cancel out) you get 2x is greater than or equal to 8

19
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:23,749
0 plus 8 is 8. And then you divide both sides by 2 since 2 is a positive number

20
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:27,154
you don't have to swap the inequality. So you divide both sides by two

21
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:32,033
and you get x needs to be greater than or equal to 4.

22
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:38,316
So the domain here is the set of all real numbers that are greater than or equal to 4

23
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:40,732
X has to be greater than or equal to 4

24
00:01:44,115 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are done!
