1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,775
Let's say you're some type of a hunter gatherer,

2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:04,319
and you're trying to figure out

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,493
how much of your time you should spend hunting

4
00:00:06,493 --> 00:00:09,591
and how much of your time to spend gathering.

5
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:12,154
So let's think about the different scenarios here

6
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:14,162
and the tradeoffs that they involve.

7
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:16,140
And just for simplicity we're going to assume that

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,275
when you're talking about hunting,

9
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:20,380
the only animal around you to hunt for are these little rabbits.

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,735
And when we talk about gathering,

11
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:23,930
the only thing you can gather are some types of berries,

12
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,217
that will keep our conversation a little bit simpler.

13
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:28,390
So, let's think about all of the scenarios.

14
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,000
So, first let's call this first scenario scenario A.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,913
And let's say, so let's call this the number of rabbits.

16
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:42,208
And then let's call this the number of berries.

17
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,859
Let's do this column the number of berries you can get.

18
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,525
So, if you were to spend the entire day going after rabbits,

19
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:51,717
all of your free time, out of making sure you have time to sleep

20
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:53,847
and get dressed and all those types of things,

21
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:57,934
let's say you can actually get 5 rabbits on average on a given day.

22
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,196
But, if you spend all of your time getting rabbits,

23
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:02,682
you're not going to have any time to get berries,

24
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:05,829
so you are going to be able to get zero berries.

25
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:07,397
Now, let's say that you were to

26
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:11,497
only try to allocate a little more time to get berries,

27
00:01:11,497 --> 00:01:13,471
and a little less time to get rabbits.

28
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,807
So we'll call that scenario B.

29
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:18,085
We will call scenario B the reality

30
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:22,464
where you have enough time to get four rabbits on average,

31
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:24,195
and when you do that, all of a sudden,

32
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:28,883
you are able to get 100 berries.

33
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:30,861
And when we do the different scenarios,

34
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,189
we're assuming that everything else is equal.

35
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:37,131
You're not changing the amount of time you have either hunting or gathering.

36
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,080
You're not changing the amount of sleep,

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,073
you're not changing your techniques for hunting rabbits or hunting berries,

38
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:46,140
you're not somehow looking to do other things with your time.

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,228
So all other things are equal.

40
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:50,535
And the general term for this - it sounds very fancy

41
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:52,502
if you were to say it in a conversation -

42
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:59,206
is ceteris paribus,

43
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:01,186
which literally means, so anytime someone says

44
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:04,406
"Oh, and, you know, ceteris paribus, we assume this variable changes,"

45
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:06,065
or whatever else, they're saying we're assuming

46
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:08,518
everything else is being held equal.

47
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:17,641
So, ceteris means "all other things."

48
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:20,251
You're probably familiar with "et cetera".

49
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:26,045
It's the same word, essentially, "other things". And paribus, "equal".

50
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,268
So you're not, when you're going from scenario A to scenario B,

51
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:30,862
you're not changing the amount of time you're sleeping,

52
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:32,621
you're not changing somehow

53
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:35,538
the geography where you are in a dramatic way.

54
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:39,390
You're not changing the tools you use, or the technology.

55
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,828
Everything else is equal.

56
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,119
The only variable you are changing is

57
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,733
how much time you allocate to finding rabbits

58
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:46,465
versus finding berries.

59
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:48,370
So let's do some more scenarios,

60
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,398
assuming ceteris paribus.

61
00:02:50,398 --> 00:02:53,354
So let me do scenario C.

62
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:56,626
You could, on average, have enough time to get 3 rabbits,

63
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:58,432
but if you get 3 rabbits

64
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,940
then all of a sudden, you will only be able to get,

65
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,066
or you will be able to get, or if you are only getting 3 rabbits

66
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:06,572
you're now going to be able to get 180 berries

67
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:07,998
and let's do a couple more.

68
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:09,595
I'm going to do two more scenarios.

69
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:11,634
So let's say scenario D.

70
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:15,645
If you reduce the amount of time you spend getting rabbits

71
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:18,653
so you get 2 rabbits, now all of a sudden,

72
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:23,348
you have enough time, on average, to get 240 berries,

73
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:31,215
and then let's say you spend even less time hunting for rabbits,

74
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:32,348
on average,

75
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:35,065
then you have even more time for berries,

76
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:38,433
and so you're able to get 280 berries.

77
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,817
And I'll do one more scenario, here.

78
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:44,049
So let's say scenario F. Let's call these scenarios.

79
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,153
Scenarios A through F.

80
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:50,952
So scenario F is [when] you spend all your time looking for berries,

81
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:52,334
in which case, on average,

82
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:54,515
you're going to be able to get 300 berries a day.

83
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:56,913
But since you have no time for rabbits,

84
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:59,867
you aren't going to get any rabbits.

85
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,540
So what I want to do is plot these,

86
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,645
and on one axis, I'll have the number of rabbits,

87
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,244
and on the other axis I'll have the number of berries.

88
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:10,221
- So let me do this right over here -

89
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:19,954
So this axis, I will call this my rabbit axis, and start at zero

90
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:27,533
this will be 1, 2, 3, 4, and that will be 5 rabbits.

91
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,838
And then on this axis,

92
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:34,933
I will do the berries.

93
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:39,406
So this right over here, let's make this 100 berries,

94
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:42,457
this is 200 berries,

95
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:45,368
and then this is 300 berries.

96
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,800
And so this is my berries axis.

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,333
Now, let's plot these points, these different scenarios.

98
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:55,194
So, first we have scenario A -

99
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,818
maybe I should have done all these columns

100
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,463
in that same scenario A color.

101
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:04,255
Scenario A, 5 rabbits, 0 berries.

102
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:08,192
We are right over there. That is scenario A.

103
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:17,068
Scenario B, 4 rabbits, 100 berries. That's right over there.

104
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:20,012
That's 100 berries. So, that is scenario B.

105
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:28,733
Scenario C. 3 rabbits, 180 berries. Let's see, this would be 150,

106
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:32,915
180 would be like right over there.

107
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,541
So, if you have time for 3 rabbits,

108
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,021
you have time for about 180 berries, on average,

109
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:39,579
So this is scenario C.

110
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:42,378
And then scenario D, we have in white.

111
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:44,187
If you have time for 2 rabbits,

112
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:49,571
you have time for 240 berries. So that is right around there.

113
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:55,758
So, this is scenario D. So this would be 250,

114
00:05:55,758 --> 00:05:58,025
so 240 is a little bit lower than that,

115
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:02,048
so it will be right over there. That is scenario D.

116
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:05,872
Scenario E, if you have time for 1 rabbit,

117
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,248
you have time for 280 berries.

118
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:12,061
That gets us right about there.

119
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:15,460
That is scenario E. And then finally, scenario F,

120
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,938
you are spending all of your time looking for berries,

121
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:19,754
you have no time for rabbits,

122
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,604
So all of your time for berries, no time for rabbits.

123
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:26,362
Zero rabbits, 300 berries. That's right over there.

124
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:28,702
This is scenario F.

125
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:31,030
So what [do] all of these points represent?

126
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,024
These are all points, and this is going to be a fancy word,

127
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:35,351
but it's a very simple idea.

128
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:38,567
These are all points on you as a hunter-gatherer,

129
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:41,917
on your production possibilities frontier.

130
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,159
Because if we draw a line -

131
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,287
I just arbitrarily picked these scenarios,

132
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,397
although I guess you could on average,

133
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:50,320
get 4.5 rabbits on average, or, on average, get 3.5 rabbits,

134
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,410
and then have a different number of berries -

135
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,631
So these are all points on the different combinations

136
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,844
between the trade-offs of rabbits and berries.

137
00:06:57,844 --> 00:06:59,379
Let me connect all of these,

138
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,657
Let me connect them in a colour I haven't used yet.

139
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:03,101
So let me connect them.

140
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:06,499
And what you see, it should just be one curve.

141
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:07,685
I'll draw them as a dotted line.

142
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:10,765
It's easier for me to draw a dotted curve than a straight curve.

143
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:16,012
So this right over here, this curve right over here, represents

144
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:20,747
all the possible possibilities of combinations of rabbits and berries.

145
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:22,851
I've only picked certain [ones] of them

146
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,694
but you could have a scenario right over here

147
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:27,047
maybe we could call that scenario G,

148
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,920
where on average, the amount of time you've allocated,

149
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,061
on average you would get 4.5 rabbits,

150
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:33,730
so on some days you'd get 4 rabbits,

151
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,584
and every other day you'd get 5 rabbits

152
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:37,445
so maybe it averages out to 4.5 rabbits.

153
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:38,743
And then maybe it looks like

154
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:41,328
you'd get about 50 berries, in that situation.

155
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,114
So all of these are possibilities.

156
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,923
You don't have to just jump from 4 rabbits to 5 rabbits,

157
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,159
or maybe, you know, you are spending,

158
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:50,377
maybe in this scenario, you're spending 7 hours,

159
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,018
and in this scenario you spend 8 hours,

160
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:53,681
but you could spend 7 hours and a minute

161
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,032
or 7 hours and a second, so anything in between is possible,

162
00:07:57,032 --> 00:08:01,864
and all of those possibilities are on this curve.

163
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:04,066
So these 5 scenarios,

164
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,808
actually these 6 scenarios that we've talked about so far,

165
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:11,684
these are just, scenarios on this curve,

166
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:16,363
and that curve, we call, once again fancy term, simple idea,

167
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:33,289
our production possibilities frontier.

168
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:38,099
Because it shows all of the different possibilties we can do, we can get.

169
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,568
3 rabbits and 180 berries,

170
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:44,665
2 rabbits and 240 berries.

171
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:47,628
What we cannot do is something that's beyond this.

172
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:51,575
So for example, we can't get scenario like this:

173
00:08:51,575 --> 00:09:01,713
So this right over here would be impossible.

174
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:04,094
So this right over here is impossible.

175
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:08,288
This point over here, where I'm getting 5 rabbits and 200 berries.

176
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:09,455
If I'm getting 5 rabbits,

177
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:11,285
I'm spending all my time getting rabbits,

178
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,963
I have no time for berries. Or, another way to think of it,

179
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:15,357
if I'm getting 200 berries,

180
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:17,862
I don't have enough time to get 5 rabbits.

181
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:20,726
So this point is impossible. This point would be impossible.

182
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:26,502
Any point that's on this side of the curve is impossible.

183
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:29,599
Now, any point on this side of the curve,

184
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,368
you can kind of view it as inside the curve,

185
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:33,884
or below the curve, or to the left of the curve.

186
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:40,470
All of these points, right over here are possible.

187
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,783
These points, for example,

188
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:46,176
it is very easy for me to get 1 rabbit, and 200 berries.

189
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,964
So that right over there, is possible.

190
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,386
Now, is that optimal? No!

191
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:52,628
Because if I were to really work properly,

192
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:57,598
I could get many more berries, or I could get more rabbits

193
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,867
for if I have 200 berries, I could get more rabbits,

194
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,467
or if I'm concerned, if I only want 1 rabbit,

195
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:05,044
I can get more berries, so this is possible.

196
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:07,487
All of the points down here are possible,

197
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,383
but they aren't optimal. They are not efficient.

198
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,979
So the points in here,

199
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:17,722
we'll just say that they are not efficient.

200
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:21,118
Maybe somehow I'm not using my resources optimally

201
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:24,364
to do this type of thing when I'm over here.

202
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:27,703
Or maybe I'm just not being optimally focused,

203
00:10:27,703 --> 00:10:28,862
or whatever it might be.

204
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,457
If you're talking about a factory setting,

205
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:33,565
when you're talking about deciding to make one thing or another,

206
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:38,462
then maybe you just aren't using the resources in an optimal way.

207
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:42,935
Now, all the points on the frontier - these are efficient.

208
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,830
You're doing the most you can do.

209
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,638
Right now we're not making any judgement between whether

210
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:51,078
any of these possibilties are better than any other possibility.

211
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:52,696
All we are saying is that

212
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:54,441
you are doing the most that you can do.

213
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:58,366
Any of these things you are making the most use of your time.
