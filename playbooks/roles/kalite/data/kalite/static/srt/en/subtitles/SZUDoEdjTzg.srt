99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So where we left off in the last video, Vi and myself had posed a mystery to you. We had talked about

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Benford's law, and we asked, "What is up with Benford's law?"

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This idea that if you took just random countries and took their population and took the most significant

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
figures of their population and plotted

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the numbers, the numbers of countries that their most significant figures were a 1 versus a 2 versus

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a 3, you just had - it was much more likely that it was a 1.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or that, if you took physical constants of the universe that they're most likely to have 1

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as their most significant digit.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that - I wish we had more graphs, because graphs are FUN -

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but if you look at information from the stock market or ANYTHING

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it seemed to all follow this curve. And what was EXTREMELY mysterious -

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is where we finished off the last video -

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you look at PURE, I would say, compounding phenomenon

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like, say, the Fibbonaci sequence or powers of 2

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that exactly fits the Benford distribution.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It exactly fits this. If you take all the powers of 2 exactly 30%, or I don't know if a little bit over 30%

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of those powers of 2, all of those powers of 2 have 1 as their most significant digit.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A little bit - what is this? 17? Roughly 17% of all of them have 2 as their most significant digit.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Although in this case, there was an infinite number in every test case, so it was harder to graph.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But if you wanted to try it out, you could take the first million powers of 2 and then find the percentage

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that would probably give you a pretty good approximation of things.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So to me that's, like, less mysterious when you're looking at - I mean -

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the one hand, wow, this fits exactly with mathematics but that also gives you a really good handle

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
'cuz you realize, alright, there's something here I can actually take a look at.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can take a look at and it becomes something you can dig deeper in.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We said in the last video we wanted you to pause it and think deeper

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because frankly, we had to do the same thing,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and a big clue for us was when we looked at a logarithmic scale

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're looking at one right over here, and just to be clear:

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what's going on in this logarithmic scale is, you see equal spaces on the scale are powers of 10

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so on a linear scale this would be a 1 and maybe this would be a 2 and then a 3

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or if we wanted to say this is a 2, you'd say this is a 1, this is a 10, this would be a 20 and a 30,

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so on and so forth, but on a logarithmic scale equal distances are times 10

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or in this case if we're taking powers of 10

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is 1:10 then 10:100 then 100:1000 and you see how the numbers in between fall out

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the space between 1 and 2 is pretty big and the space between 2 and 3 is still pretty big
