1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:03,381
So, once again let's think of yourself as some type of

2
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:07,885
ancient philosopher/mathematician, who is trying to extend

3
00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:12,317
mathematics as much as possible and try to make sure that you're not being lazy

4
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:15,537
and leaving things undefined, when you might be able to define them.

5
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:19,916
Whenever you start extending mathematics, especially in the realm of

6
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:23,700
multiplication and division, there are few things that you hold dear to.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,569
You feel that if you define some type of division operation,

8
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,083
that needs to be undone by multiplication; this is close to your heart.

9
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,369
So you assume... You want to assume...

10
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:39,067
You would like to assume that any type of division operation, if you start

11
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:42,672
with some number and if you divide with a number

12
00:00:42,672 --> 00:00:45,851
over which... - division by that number is defined - so when

13
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,903
I divide by some number and then multiply

14
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:51,896
by that same number that this should get me this original number

15
00:00:51,896 --> 00:00:55,189
right over here, this should give me x right over here.

16
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:59,315
And this happens when we just multiply and divide with regular numbers.

17
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:04,619
If I get 3 divided by 2 times 2, that's gonna get me 3. If I say

18
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,271
10 divided by 5 times 5,

19
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:13,439
that's going to get me 10. The other things that I want to assume...

20
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,364
- and this is very close to my heart - I feel that any type of definitions I make

21
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:35,067
have to be constant with the idea x*0 has to be 0 or any x.

22
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,368
So these are close to my heart. I wanna extend

23
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:41,299
mathematics. These two things are things that cannot be contradicted,

24
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,719
cannot be untrue.

25
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,980
Now, that out of the way. You wanna start exploring the divide-by-0 question.

26
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,353
So the first thing that you say: "Well, let me just try to define it." So let's

27
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:53,850
start, let't assume

28
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,586
that I have, so this is... So let's make a further assumption...

29
00:01:57,586 --> 00:02:02,283
that x is some non-zero number.

30
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:05,465
Let's just say, well,maybe the best way of finding out what

31
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:09,303
x divided by 0 should be, how I should divide it, let's just assume

32
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:12,140
there is define, and then come up with any results

33
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,741
that there might be, there might be a resolve for.

34
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:17,639
So let's say that x divided by 0

35
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:29,351
is equal to k.

36
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,278
Well, if this is true and if we are defining what it means

37
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:37,656
to divide by zero, then we are assuming that if we multiply by zero,

38
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:41,846
we'll get our original number right over here. This is something that we are not willing to

39
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:46,880
contradict. So let's see what happens: x divided by 0 is equal to k.

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,764
On the left hand side we have a divide by zero

41
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:53,279
and than multiplied by zero. Well then if two things are equal,

42
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:57,197
if I do something to one thing inorder for them to stay equal, I have to do it

43
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:59,949
to the other thing. This has to be equal to that.

44
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:03,096
I have to multiply the left hand AND the right hand side by zero.

45
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:07,575
Well, then by this assumption that I am never willing to give up, this left hand side

46
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:13,713
right over here, must be equal to x.

47
00:03:13,713 --> 00:03:17,163
And by this assumption right over here, that I am not willing to give up,

48
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,733
This right hand side right over here

49
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:25,285
must be equal to 0.

50
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:27,697
But I just hit a contradiction!

51
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:31,513
I assume that x does not equal to 0, and now I am being forced to say

52
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:36,798
that x=0. And I am not willing to give up the idea,

53
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:39,551
I am not willing to give up either of these ideas. I am defining

54
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:43,630
what it means to divide by zero. Or if I am defining what it means to divide by anything...

55
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,101
...that if I then multiply by that something, that I should get my original number.

56
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,500
And I am not willing to give up the idea that anything times 0 is 0.

57
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,578
So all of these things... The only thing that I can give up

58
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:59,396
is this right over here. And I'll say, well, I guess k will have to

59
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:02,763
stay undefined.

60
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:09,121
This whole contradiction happened because I attempted to define what x/0 is.

61
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:10,771
Now that out of the way... OK...

62
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:15,058
This was a situation when x does not equal zero. But what about

63
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:20,548
when x DOES equal zero. So let's think about that a little bit.

64
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,008
And once again, I will try to

65
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:27,266
define it. So I will assume...

66
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:32,280
that 0 divided by 0 is equal to some number.

67
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:39,148
Well once again, so let's say it is equal to k again. And so, once again...

68
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:43,213
we are trying to do the same logic, so we'll write 0/0

69
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:46,141
is equal to k. Actually, let me colourcode these zeros.

70
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:50,193
This will be a magenta zero and this is a blue zero

71
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:54,090
right over here. And once again, I am not willing to give up the idea that

72
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,915
if I start with a number x, I divide it by something over which division is

73
00:04:57,915 --> 00:05:02,280
defined, and then I multiply by that something, I should get my original x again.

74
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,751
I can't give this up. Otherwise it doesn't seem like a good definition

75
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:10,024
for the division. So what I am gonna do - I am gonna multiply the left-hand side

76
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:13,996
times 0 and by this property that I am

77
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:18,299
not willing to give up, the left-hand side should simplify to this magenta

78
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:21,650
zero. It should simplify to this over here. But once again,

79
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,629
anything I do to once side of the equation, inorder for the equation to hold

80
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:29,042
true, I need to the other side of the equation. And these two were equal beforehand.

81
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:33,064
Any operation I do to this inorder for it to still be equal , I need to do to that.

82
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:38,664
So let me multiply the right-hand side by zero.

83
00:05:38,664 --> 00:05:40,142
So the left I get

84
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:44,396
0, I just get this magenta 0, and on the right

85
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:48,267
I could just write the zero here, but I won't simplify

86
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:54,037
it. I get k times 0.

87
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,792
Well, this I see right over here...

88
00:05:55,792 --> 00:06:00,200
This actually is not a contradiction. This actually is true for any k,

89
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,906
This is one of the core assumptions that I've made in my mathematics

90
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:09,765
that I am not willing to give up. So this is true

91
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:18,762
True for any k. It's not a contradiction. But the problem here is I wanna come up with

92
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:22,693
the k, I'd like a resolve for a k. It would not be nice if this turned out to be 0.

93
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:25,338
if this turned out to be one, or if this turned out to be negative one

94
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:28,071
But now I see, given the assumptions right here

95
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:33,031
this could be ANY... this could be absolutely any k

96
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:36,500
I cannot determine what k this should be

97
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:40,932
This could be a hundred thousand, this could be 75, it could be anything

98
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,633
true for any k

99
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:48,993
I cannot determine

100
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,236
what k this should be

101
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:54,229
and that's why when you get a little bit more nuance in early math

102
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:57,402
people will say, well 0 divided by 0, well we don't know what that's gonna be

103
00:06:57,402 --> 00:06:59,515
there's no consistent answer there

104
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,496
so we're just going to call it undefined

105
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:04,585
there's no good answer that seems better than any other answer

106
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:07,255
but now we see a little bit nuance here

107
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:09,667
one divided by zero... you just couldn't define it

108
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,470
it led to direct contradictions

109
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,800
zero divided by zero... it could be anything

110
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,214
you can't determine it

111
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:18,934
and so that's why, when you do higher level math

112
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:21,677
and you'll often hear this when you take a calculus course

113
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:31,567
we sat that zero divided by zero is indeterminate
