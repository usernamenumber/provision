1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,770
Let's say we're going to
shoot some object into

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,220
the air at an angle.

4
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,075
Let's say its speed is s and
the angle at which we shoot

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:14,090
it, the angle above the
horizontal is theta.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,780
What I want to do in this video
is figure out how far

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,990
this object is going to travel
as a function of the angle and

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,770
as a function of the speed, but
we're going to assume that

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,590
we're given the speed.

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,250
That that's a bit
of a constant.

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,120
So if this is the ground right
here, we want to figure out

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,920
how far this thing is
going to travel.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,800
So you can imagine, it's going
to travel in this parabolic

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,050
path and land at some
point out there.

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,000
And so if this is at distance 0,
we could call this distance

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,950
out here distance d.

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,090
Now whenever you do any problem
like this where you're

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,750
shooting something off at an
angle, the best first step is

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,640
to break down that vector.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,235
Remember, a vector is something
that has magnitude

21
00:00:57,235 --> 00:00:58,210
and direction.

22
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,240
The magnitude is s.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,960
Maybe feet per second
or miles per hour.

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,459
And the direction is theta.

25
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,820
So if you have s and theta,
you're giving me a vector.

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,900
And so what you want to do is
you want to break this vector

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,370
down into its vertical and
horizontal components first

28
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,700
and then deal with
them separately.

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,560
One, to help you figure out how
long you're in the air.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,420
And then, the other to
figure out how far

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,040
you actually travel.

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,050
So let me make a big version
of the vector right there.

33
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,590
Once again, the magnitude
of the vector is s.

34
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,970
So you could imagine that the
length of this arrow is s.

35
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,800
And this angle right
here is theta.

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,390
   

37
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,550
And to break it down into its
horizontal and vertical

38
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,360
components, we just set up a
right triangle and just use

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,770
our basic trig ratios.

40
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,030
So let me do that.

41
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,490
So this is the ground
right there.

42
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,850
I can drop a vertical from the
tip of that arrow to set up a

43
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,100
right triangle.

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,560
And the length of the-- or the
magnitude of the vertical

45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,910
component of our velocity
is going to be this

46
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,160
length right here.

47
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,810
   

48
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,930
That is going to be-- you could
imagine, the length of

49
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,790
that is going to be our
vertical speed.

50
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,590
So this is our vertical speed.

51
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,880
Maybe I'll just call that
the speed sub vertical.

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,860
And then, this right here, the
length of this part of the

53
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,160
triangle-- let me do that
in a different color.

54
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,880
The length of this part of the
triangle is going to be our

55
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,890
horizontal speed, or the
component of this velocity in

56
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,770
the horizontal direction.

57
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,750
And I use this word velocity
when I specify

58
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,940
a speed and a direction.

59
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,310
Speed is just the magnitude
of the velocity.

60
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,380
So the magnitude of this side
is going to be speed

61
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,470
horizontal.

62
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,370
And to figure it out,
you literally use

63
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,280
our basic trig ratios.

64
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,490
So we have a right triangle.

65
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,800
This is the hypotenuse.

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,210
And we could write down
soh cah toa up here.

67
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,800
   

68
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,000
Let me write it down
in yellow.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,880
soh cah toa.

70
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,960
And this tells us that sine is
opposite over hypotenuse,

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,680
cosine is adjacent over
hypotenuse and tangent is

72
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,690
opposite over adjacent.

73
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,690
So let's see what we can do.

74
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,020
We're assuming we know
theta, we know s.

75
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,480
We want to figure out what the
vertical and the horizontal

76
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,690
components are.

77
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,110
So what's the vertical component
going to be?

78
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,150
Well the vertical component
is opposite this theta.

79
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,320
But we know the hypotenuse is
s, so we could use sine

80
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,790
because that deals with the
opposite and the hypotenuse.

81
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,610
And the sine function tells us
that sine of theta-- actually,

82
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,710
let me do this in green since
we're doing all the vertical

83
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,060
stuff in green.

84
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,560
Sine of theta is going to be
equal to opposite, which is

85
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,620
the magnitude of our
vertical velocity.

86
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,520
So the opposite side is this
side right here, over our

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,270
hypotenuse.

88
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,430
And our hypotenuse
is the speed s.

89
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,150
And so if we want to solve for
our vertical velocity or the

90
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,310
vertical component of our
velocity, we multiply both

91
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,250
sides of this equation by s.

92
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,990
So you get s sine of theta
is equal to the vertical

93
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:27,010
component of our velocity,
s sine of theta.

94
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,450
And now for the horizontal
component we do the same

95
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,830
thing, but we don't
use sine anymore.

96
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,430
This is now adjacent
to the angle.

97
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,290
So cosine deals with the
adjacent side and the

98
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,140
hypotenuse.

99
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,580
So we could say that the cosine
of theta is equal to

100
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,790
the adjacent side to the angle,
that is the horizontal

101
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,560
speed, over the hypotenuse.

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,520
The hypotenuse is this length
right here, over s.

103
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,440
So if we want to solve for the
horizontal speed or the

104
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,550
horizontal component or the
magnitude of the horizontal

105
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,720
component, we'd just multiply
both sides times s.

106
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,980
And you get s cosine of
theta is equal to

107
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,970
the horizontal component.

108
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,860
So we now know how fast we are
travelling in this direction,

109
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,860
in the horizontal component.

110
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,140
We know that that is going
to be s cosine of theta.

111
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:31,200
And we know in the vertical
direction-- let me do that in

112
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,470
the vertical direction, the
magnitude is s sine of theta.

113
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,560
It is s sine of theta.

114
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,120
So now that we've broken up into
the two components, we're

115
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,880
ready to figure out how long
we're going to be in the air.

116
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,134
