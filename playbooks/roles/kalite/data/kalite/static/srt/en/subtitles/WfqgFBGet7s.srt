1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,570
Let's start with a warm
up ratio problem.

3
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,280
Then we can tackle some harder
word problems. So I have the

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:15,750
ratio 13/6 is equal to 5/x.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,740
I don't like having this x in
the denominator, so let's

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,420
multiply both sides of
this equation by x.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,150
So if I multiply both sides by
x, what's going to happen?

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,810
On the right hand side, this
x cancels out with that x.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,300
And then the left hand side
going to become 13 over 6x is

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,910
equal to-- you're just going
to have a 5 there.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,650
And then to solve for x, you
just multiply both sides by

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,010
the inverse of 13/6.

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,670
6/13.

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,320
These, obviously, cancel out.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,940
That's why I multiplied
it by the inverse.

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,320
And you get x is equal to 5
times 6, which is 30/13.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,220
Now one way that you might see
this done-- it's kind of

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,470
skipping a step-- is called
cross multiplying.

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,150
You look at a ratio like this,
and you immediately say the

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,430
numerator on this side times the
denominator on that side

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,690
is equal to the numerator
on this side times the

22
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,520
denominator on that side.

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,710
Let me write that out.

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,380
So you might sometimes see
people immediately go to-- let

25
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,680
me just rewrite the problem
actually-- So that original

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,750
problem was 13/6 is
equal to 5/x.

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,700
You might sometimes immediately
see someone go to

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,950
13 times x is equal
to 5 times 6.

29
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,550
And it might look like magic.

30
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,470
How does that work out?

31
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,520
Why does that make sense?

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,610
And really, all they're doing
to get to this point is they

33
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,430
are simultaneously multiplying
both sides of the equation by

34
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,620
both denominators.

35
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,550
Let me show you what I mean.

36
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,150
If I multiply both sides of this
equation by 6 and an x,

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,245
what's going to happen?

38
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:52,490
If I multiply it by 6x times
both sides of this equation--

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,700
And where did I get the 6?

40
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,190
From here.

41
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,030
Where did I get the x?

42
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,460
From there.

43
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,850
Both denominators.

44
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,040
What's going to happen?

45
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,470
On this side of the equation,
the 6 is going to cancel out

46
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,890
with this denominator.

47
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,580
And on the right hand side of
the equation, the x is going

48
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,600
to cancel with this
denominator.

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,870
So you're going to be left
with 13 times x is

50
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,210
equal to 5 times 6.

51
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,290
So nothing fancy there.

52
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,570
You're just multiplying by the
denominators of both sides of

53
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,000
the equation.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,060
And it looks like you're
cross multiplying.

55
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,090
13x is equal to 5 times 6.

56
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,600
And then from here, of course,
you divide both sides by 13.

57
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,950
You get x is equal to 30/13.

58
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,910
Now that we're all warmed up,
let's tackle some actual word

59
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,740
problems.

60
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,990
So we have the highest
mountain in

61
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,800
Canada is Mount Yukon.

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,990
It is 298/67 the size
of then Ben Nevis.

63
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:55,470
Let's Y for Yukon is equal to
298/67 the size of-- let's say

64
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,630
N for Nevis.

65
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,990
That's what this in
green tells us.

66
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,800
The highest peak in Scotland.

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,840
Mount Elbert in Colorado
is the highest peak

68
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
in the Rocky Mountains.

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,790
Mount Elbert-- so we have this
other information here-- Mount

70
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,450
Elbert is 220/67 the height
of Ben Nevis.

71
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,850
So let's say, E for Elbert.

72
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:21,720
E is equal to 22/67
times Nevis.

73
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,290
Times the same Ben Nevis,
right there.

74
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,420
And they're telling us more.

75
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,230
And, it is 44/48 the
size of Mont Blanc.

76
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:37,950
So Elbert is equal to 44/48
the size of Mont Blanc.

77
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,890
Let's write B for Mount Blanc.

78
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,300
They also tell us Mont Blanc
is 4,800 meters high.

79
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,090
Mont Blanc is 4,800.

80
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,700
meters high.

81
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,860
So B is equal to 4,800.

82
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,120
And they ask us, how high
is Mount Yukon?

83
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,900
So we have to figure out Y.

84
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,190
So let's see if we can work
backwards, and figure out all

85
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,230
the variables in between.

86
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,810
So let's start with this
information here.

87
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,560
B is equal to 4,800.

88
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,140
E is equal to 44/48 times B.

89
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:14,490
So E-- so Elbert-- is equal to
44/48 times Mont Blanc, which

90
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,279
is 4,800 meters.

91
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,690
Now if you divide that by 48--
4,800 divided by 48 is 100.

92
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,210
So Elbert is 44 times
100 meters high.

93
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,870
So it's equal to 4,400 meters.

94
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,730
Fair enough.

95
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,960
Now we can use this
information and

96
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,650
substitute it over here.

97
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,360
We get Elbert, which is 4,400
meters high, is equal to

98
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,510
220/67 times Ben Nevis.

99
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,850
N for Nevis.

100
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,340
To solve for Nevis, we multiply
both sides by the

101
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,440
inverse of this coefficient
right here.

102
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,740
So we multiply both
sides by 67/220.

103
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:05,750
So times 67/220.

104
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,810
The 67 cancels with that 67.

105
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,920
That 220 cancels
with that 220.

106
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,870
And then you get-- let's see,
if I take 4,400 divided by

107
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,480
220-- 440 divided by 220 is 2.

108
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,350
So this is going to be 20.

109
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,640
So 4,400 divided by
220 is just 20.

110
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,360
So you get Nevis is equal
to-- I'll swap sides.

111
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,770
So Ben Nevis is equal to
67 times 20 meters.

112
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,930
And now that's what?

113
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,420
1,340 meters.

114
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,620
Is that is right?

115
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,250
Well, lets just leave it like
that, because we could--

116
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,570
actually it looks like that's
67-- I'm going to leave Nevis

117
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,530
as 67 times 20 meters.

118
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,800
And substitute it right there.

119
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,940
So Yukon-- I'll just go down
here, because I have more real

120
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:58,050
estate there-- Yukon is equal
to 298 over 67 times the

121
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,280
height of Nevis.

122
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
Nevis is 67 times 20.

123
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,340
So times 67 times 20.

124
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,180
Well I can divide 67 by
67, and I get Yukon is

125
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,430
298 times 20 meters.

126
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,380
So Yukon is equal
to 298 times 20.

127
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,430
And what is that equal to?

128
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,580
That is equal to-- Let's
see that's 2 times 298

129
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,510
is going to be 396.

130
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,380
Oh sorry, it's going
to be 596.

131
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,290
This is almost 300, so it
should be close to 600.

132
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,820
This is 2 less than 300,
so this should

133
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,730
be 4 less than 300.

134
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,340
And then, I have a 0 here.

135
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,200
So it's going to be
5,960 meters.

136
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,650
And we are done.

137
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,920
Let's do one more of these
word problems. All right.

138
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,390
At a large high school, it is
estimated that 2 out of every

139
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,630
3 students have a cell phone.

140
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:05,790
And 1 in 5 of all students have
a cellphone that is one

141
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,140
year old or less.

142
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,550
All right.

143
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,940
So let's think about it.

144
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:16,915
Let's say that x is equal to the
total number of students.

145
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:20,930
   

146
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,670
This first line, 2 out of 3
students have a cell phone, so

147
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:30,640
we could say that 2/3
x have cell phone.

148
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,340
   

149
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,630
That's what that green
statement tells us.

150
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,810
And then that purple statement--
1 in 5 of all

151
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,080
students have a cellphone that
is one year old or less.

152
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,136
So 1/5 x have less than
1/5 year cell phone.

153
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:50,970
   

154
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,720
So they want to know, out of
the students who own a cell

155
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,950
phone-- so it's out of this--
that's our denominator.

156
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,340
So let me write that down.

157
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,440
That is our denominator.

158
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,420
So out of the students who
have a cellphone-- that's

159
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,770
right there-- they want to know
what proportion owns a

160
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,160
phone that is more than
one year old.

161
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,280
So how many students have a cell
phone that is more than

162
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,540
one year old?

163
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,090
Well, we could take the total
number that have a cellphone,

164
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,500
which is 2/3 x.

165
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,620
2/3 of all the students
have a cell phone.

166
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,430
We can subtract out all of the
students that have a new

167
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,560
cellphone-- a cell phone that
is less than one year.

168
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,420
Remember they're saying more
than one year here.

169
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,630
So we want to subtract out all
the students with the new

170
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,919
cellphone, minus 1/5x, and you
will then have the proportion

171
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,700
of students who have
this right here.

172
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,590
This is right here.

173
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:49,600
This is, have greater than
1/5 year cell phone.

174
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,470
They have a phone, but it's
more than 1/5 years old.

175
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,230
This is all of them that
have a cellphone.

176
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,780
We subtract out the new ones.

177
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,470
So this is, essentially, all
of the people who have an

178
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,510
older than one-year
old cell phone.

179
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,300
So to solve this, we just
subtract the fractions.

180
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,140
So this is just going to be,
let's see, 2/3 is the same

181
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,080
thing as 10/15.

182
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,170
That's 2/3 minus 1/5.

183
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,960
The same thing as 3/15 x.

184
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,900
Which is equal to 10
minus 3 is 7/15 x.

185
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,830
Is the total proportion of
students-- that's this

186
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,450
orange-- what proportion owns
a phone that is more

187
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,160
than one year old?

188
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,590
It's 7/15 x.

189
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,090
That's an actual number.

190
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,810
So if you want to know, out of
the students who own a cell

191
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,230
phone-- so out of the students
who own a cell phone, right

192
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,560
there-- 2/3x, what proportion
owns a phone that it is more

193
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,800
than one year old?

194
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,870
This is the number that own a
cellphone that is more than

195
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,700
one year old.

196
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,820
And this whole value is the
proportion out of the students

197
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,330
who have a cell phone.

198
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,270
Lucky for us, the
x's cancel out.

199
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,300
And we are left with this is
equal to 7/15 times the

200
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,950
inverse of the denominator.

201
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,980
You divide by 2/3.

202
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,000
That's the same thing as
multiplying by 3/2.

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,940
And what does this equal to?

204
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,250
Divide by 3.

205
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,750
   

206
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,740
We are left with 7/10.

207
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,840
So of the students who own a
cell phone, 7 out of 10 of the

208
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,080
students who own a cell phone,
own a cell phone that is more

209
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,730
than one year old.

210
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,110
And we are done.

211
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,466
