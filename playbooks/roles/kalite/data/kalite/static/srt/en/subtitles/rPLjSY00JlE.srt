1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:06,014
Every cell in the human body needs energy to survive and do its different functions, if we are talking

2
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:12,051
about our brain cell it needs energy to keep stimulating other brain cells and sending on signals and

3
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:18,351
messages. If it's muscle cell it needs energy to contract they need energy just to do the basic function of a cell

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:24,662
and the place where they get that energy from or the primary source of that energy is from

5
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:33,506
glucose, and glucose is a simple sugar. if you actually tasted glucose, it would taste sweet. And glucose

6
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:39,636
gets delivered to cells through the blood stream. So this right here, I'm drawing some blood that's

7
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:46,013
passing by a cell, maybe the blood is going in that direction over there and inside blood let me draw

8
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:54,126
some small glucose molecules passing by. So in an ideal situation when the cell needs energy ,

9
00:00:54,126 --> 00:01:05,092
glucose will enter the cell. unfortunately it's not that simple for the great majority of cell in human

10
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:14,400
body. The glucose won't enter by itself, it needs the assistance of a hormone or a molecule called insulin.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,169
So let me label all of these, this is glucose and it needs insulin

12
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:31,646
so let me draw insulin here as a magenta molecule. There. that is INSULIN

13
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:35,382
and in the surface of this cells there are insulin receptors on them

14
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:43,036
and I've drawn a simplified version of them -- places where these magenta circles can attach

15
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:49,000
can bind, and what happens is that in order for the glucose to be taken up by the cell

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,318
insulin has to attach to this receptors which unlock the channels for glucose

17
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:00,644
in order for the glucose to be taken up by the cell, insulin has to bind to the insulin receptors

18
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:07,805
and once that happens then the glucose can be taken up by the cell

19
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:15,036
now unfortunately things don't work always as planned. So let me draw a couple of scenarios here

20
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:22,333
let me draw my simple version of a cell, and let me draw the blood stream going by... right over here

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:37,418
and draw the glucose in the blood stream, floating by, and then I have my insulin receptors

22
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:45,467
on the surface of the cell. Now the first thing that could go wrong here is: What if the body does not produce insulin?

23
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:52,513
Insulin is produced in the Pancreas, what happens if the pancreas is not producing insulin properly?

24
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:59,338
so.. no insulin. In this situation there is nothing to bind to these receptors, so the

25
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:05,387
glucose channels won't be opened up and the glucose won't be able to enter into the cell

26
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:14,725
This situation is "Type I Diabetes"

27
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:22,095
where you have glucose, so there you have energy and you have properly functioning insulin receptors,

28
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:29,831
you just don't have insulin to unlock the gates for the glucose to actually go into the cell

29
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:40,062
the other scenario that you could imagine happening is...let me draw the cell again and the blood stream

30
00:03:41,123 --> 00:03:49,308
and obviously that is one of trillions of cells in the human body. We have an estimated ten to one-hundred trillion cells

31
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:56,677
so this is just a simple diagram to get the point across. So, once again let me draw some glucose floating by...

32
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:12,554
some insulin receptors on the cell, and let's have some insulin. So our Pancreas is producing insulin

33
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:16,882
and putting it into our bloodstream, so it's there to be used.

34
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:22,944
but a situation can arise where the receptors are not working properly,

35
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:43,994
and they have been desensitized to insulin. In this situation, the receptors have difficulty binding to the insulin.

36
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:52,817
and glucose does not enter the cell. Thus, in either one of these scenarios

37
00:04:52,817 --> 00:05:03,440
and let's just think in a broad sense. Oh, and I didn't even name the second scenario here

38
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:16,863
The second one, as you can imagine, if this up here is Type 1 , this down here is Type 2 diabetes.

39
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:26,563
Now, one way of managing Type 1 diabetes is to inject insulin into the bloodstream.

40
00:05:26,563 --> 00:05:37,294
The only problem here, and it's a big one, is that there is no insulin in the bloodstream. So, over here we can inject insulin.

41
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:44,578
So, you'll have insulin to attach to the receptors, and so the glucose can be processed properly.

42
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:49,740
With Type 2 diabetes, there are multiple lines of attack.

43
00:05:49,740 --> 00:06:06,040
To help Type 2 diabetes, drugs and lifestyle changes can be used to help resensitize the body to insulin and glucose.

44
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:14,894
Just like with Type 1, insulin can also be injected into the bloodstream. Now, you might say "Wait! I already have insulin here...

45
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:19,209
why would I add MORE insulin?". Remember, just because the cells

46
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:24,063
are desensitized, it doesn't mean they won't bind with insulin, it just means it will take MORE insulin

47
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:30,317
to uptake the same amount of glucose. So, if you add enough insulin, there may be enough

48
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:33,047
to bind with the insulin receptors and cause some glucose absorption.

49
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:43,447
But, there's multiple lines of attack here, and usually the first is drugs that help resensitize the receptors.

50
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:48,671
The last thing I want to cover is what would happen if you didn't treat the diabetes.

51
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:56,334
There are two major problems here: 1. Your cells can't function without glucose.

52
00:06:56,334 --> 00:07:05,668
and another problem would be that sugar in the blood -- once concentrated enough

53
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:13,400
it can actually cause a lot of damage to the body.

54
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:23,724
So, you don't want either one of these things happening, you don't want too much sugar flowing in your blood and harming your body.
