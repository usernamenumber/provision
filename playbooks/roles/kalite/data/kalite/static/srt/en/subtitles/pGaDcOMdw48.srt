1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,230
   

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,850
In the last video, we had a
word problem where we had-- we

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,130
essentially had to figure out
the sides of a triangle, but

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,650
instead of, you know, just
being able to do the

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,540
Pythagorean theorem and because
it was a right triangle, it was

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,220
just kind of a normal triangle.

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,610
It wasn't a right triangle.

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,460
And we just kind of chugged
through it using SOHCAHTOA and

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,360
just our very simple trig
functions, and we got

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,480
the right answer.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,300
What I want to do now is to
introduce you to something

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,850
called the law of cosines,
which we essentially proved in

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,100
the last video, but I want to
kind of prove it in a more--

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,360
you know, without the word
problem getting in the way, and

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,600
I want to show you, once you
know the law of cosines, so you

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,810
can then apply it to a problem,
like we did in the past,

17
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,480
and you'll do it faster.

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,480
I have a bit of a mixed opinion
about it because I'm not a

19
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,010
big fan of memorizing things.

20
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,290
You know, when you're 40 years
old, you probably won't have

21
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,070
the law of cosines still
memorized, but if you have that

22
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,190
ability to start with the trig
functions and just move

23
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,560
forward, then you'll
always be set.

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,090
And I'd be impressed if
you're still doing trig

25
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,560
at 40, but who knows?

26
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,980
So let's go and let's
see what this law of

27
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,300
cosines is all about.

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,700
So let's say that I
know this angle theta.

29
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,860
   

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,475
And let's called this
side-- I don't know, a.

31
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:14,620
No, let's call this side b.

32
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,230
I'm being a little
arbitrary here.

33
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,640
Actually, let me stay in
the colors of the sides.

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,030
Let's call that b and let's
call this c, and let's

35
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,150
call this side a.

36
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,080
So if this is a right triangle,
then we could have used

37
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,630
the Pythagorean theorem
somehow, but now we can't.

38
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,310
So what do we do?

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,490
So we know a-- well, let's
assume that we know b, we know

40
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,120
c, we know theta, and then
we want to solve for a.

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,130
But, in general, as long as you
know three of these, you can

42
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,560
solve for the fourth once you
know the law of cosines.

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,610
So how can we do it?

44
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,820
Well, we're going to do
it the exact same way we

45
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,170
did that last problem.

46
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,580
We can drop a line
here to make-- oh, my

47
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,210
God, that's messy.

48
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,420
I thought I was using
the line tool.

49
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,165
Edit, undo.

50
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:08,380
   

51
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,320
So I can drop a line like that.

52
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,150
So I have two right angles.

53
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,220
And then once I have right
triangles, then now I can start

54
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,610
to use trig functions and
the Pythagorean theorem,

55
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,350
et cetera, et cetera.

56
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,210
So, let's see, this is a right
angle, this is a right angle.

57
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,750
So what is this side here?

58
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,770
Let me pick another color.

59
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,560
I'm probably going to get too
involved with all the colors,

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,380
but it's for your improvement.

61
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,400
So what is this side here?

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,720
What is the length of that
side, that purple side?

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,700
Well, that purple side is just,
you know, we use SOHCAHTOA.

64
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,605
I was just going to write
SOHCAHTOA up here.

65
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:50,850
   

66
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,700
So this purple side is adjacent
to theta, and then this blue or

67
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,910
mauve side b is the hypotenuse
of this right triangle.

68
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,140
So we know that-- I'm just
going to stick to one color

69
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,760
because it'll take me forever
if I keep switching colors.

70
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,790
We know that cosine of theta--
let's call this side, let's

71
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,660
call this kind of subside--
I don't know, let's

72
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,200
call this d, side d.

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,850
We know that cosine of theta
is equal to d over b, right?

74
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,290
And we know b.

75
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,870
Or that d is equal to what?

76
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,660
It equals b cosine theta.

77
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,750
Now, let's call this
side e right here.

78
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,810
Well, what's e?

79
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,340
Well, e is this whole c
side-- c side, oh, that's

80
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,780
interesting-- this whole c side
minus this d side, right?

81
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,630
So e is equal to c minus d.

82
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:09,320
We just solved for d, so
side e is equal to c

83
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,980
minus b cosine of theta.

84
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,800
   

85
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,590
So that's e.

86
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,900
We got e out of the way.

87
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,340
Well, what's this magenta
side going to be?

88
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,690
Well, let's call this magenta--
let's call it m from magenta.

89
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,230
   

90
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,340
Well, m is opposite to theta.

91
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,800
   

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,350
Now, we know it.

93
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,110
We've solved for c as well, but
we know b, and b is simple.

94
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,210
So what relationship gives us
m over b, or involves the

95
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,400
opposite and the hypotenuse?

96
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,110
Well, that's sine:
opposite over hypotenuse.

97
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,670
So we know that m over b is
equal to sine of theta.

98
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,520
We know that-- let
me go over here.

99
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,180
m over b, right, because this
is the hypotenuse, is equal to

100
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:08,550
sine of theta, or that m
is equal to b sine

101
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,500
of theta, right?

102
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,470
So we figured out m, we
figured out e, and now

103
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,690
we want to figure out a.

104
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,070
And this should
jump out at you.

105
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,960
We have two sides of
a right triangle.

106
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,750
We want to figure
out the hypotenuse.

107
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,410
We can use the
Pythagorean theorem.

108
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:28,490
The Pythagorean theorem tells
us a squared is equal to m

109
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,510
squared plus e squared, right?

110
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,660
Just the square of
the other two sides.

111
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,920
Well, what's m squared
plus e squared?

112
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,970
Let me switch to another
color just to be arbitrary.

113
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,360
a squared is equal
to m squared.

114
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,030
m is b sine of theta.

115
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:53,590
So it's b sine of theta
squared plus e squared.

116
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,790
Well, e we figure out is this.

117
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:02,820
So it's plus c minus b
cosine theta squared.

118
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,940
Now, let's just chug
through some algebra.

119
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:13,090
So that equals b sine-- b
squared sine squared of theta.

120
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,970
Sine squared of theta
just means sine of

121
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,480
theta squared, right?

122
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,700
Plus, and we just foiled
this out, although I

123
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,420
don't like using foil.

124
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,620
I just multiply it out.

125
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:33,810
c squared minus 2cb cosine
theta plus b squared

126
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,420
cosine theta, right?

127
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,490
I just expanded this out
by multiplying it out.

128
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,310
And now let's see if we can
do anything interesting.

129
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,780
Well, if we take this term and
this term, we get-- those two

130
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:54,360
terms are b squared sine
squared of theta plus b squared

131
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,110
cosine-- this should be squared
there, right, because

132
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,350
we squared it.

133
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,780
b squared cosine squared of
theta, and then we have plus c

134
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:10,350
squared minus 2bc cosine theta.

135
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,470
Well, what does
this simplify to?

136
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,735
Well, this is the same thing
as b squared times the

137
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:22,470
sine squared theta plus
cosine squared of theta.

138
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,420
Something should be jumping out
at you, and that's plus c

139
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,330
squared minus 2bc cosine theta.

140
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,170
Well, this thing, sine
squared plus cosine

141
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,910
squared of any angle is 1.

142
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,010
That's one of the
earlier identities.

143
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,930
That's the Pythagorean
identity right there.

144
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:47,210
So this equals 1, so then
we're left with-- going

145
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,970
back to my original color.

146
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:56,230
We're almost there-- a squared
is equal to-- this term just

147
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,020
becomes 1, so b squared.

148
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:07,160
We're just left with a b
squared plus c squared

149
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:16,330
minus 2bc cosine of theta.

150
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,940
That's pretty neat, and this
is called the law of cosines.

151
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,410
And it's useful because, you
know, if you know an angle

152
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,460
and two of the sides of
any triangle, you can now

153
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,930
solve for the other side.

154
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,170
Or really, if you want to, if
you know three sides of a

155
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,810
triangle, you can now solve
for any angle, so that

156
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,780
also is very useful.

157
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,150
The only reason why I'm a
little bit, you know, here,

158
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,050
there, is I don't-- if you are
in trigonometry right now and

159
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,590
you might have a test, you
should memorize this because

160
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,490
it'll make you faster, and
you'll get the answer

161
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,650
right quicker.

162
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,310
I'm not a big fan of just
memorizing it without knowing

163
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,600
where it came from, because a
year from now or two years from

164
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,530
now when you go to college and
it's been four years since you

165
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,040
took trigonometry, you probably
won't have this memorized.

166
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,990
And if you face a trig problem
all of a sudden, it's good to

167
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,030
kind of get there from scratch.

168
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,820
With that said, this is the law
of cosines, and if you use the

169
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,450
law of cosines, you could have
done that problem we just did a

170
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,070
lot faster because we just--
you know, you just have to set

171
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,620
up the triangle and then just
substitute into this, and you

172
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,600
could have solved for a in
that ship off-course problem.

173
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,780
I'll see you in the next video.

174
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,500
