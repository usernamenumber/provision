1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,013
We're asked to simplify this
huge, long expression here. x

3
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:07,720
to the third plus 3x minus 6--
that's in parentheses-- plus

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,700
negative 2x squared
plus x minus 2.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,420
And then minus the quantity
3x minus 4.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,790
So a good place to start, we'll
just rewrite this and

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,550
see if we can eliminate the
parentheses in this step.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,420
So let's just start
at the beginning.

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,270
We have the x to the third
right over there.

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,435
So x to the third and then
plus 3x-- I'll do that in

11
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:29,685
pink-- plus 3x.

12
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:32,090
   

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,510
And then we have a minus 6.

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,570
And we don't have to put the
parentheses around there,

15
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,770
those don't really
change anything.

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,750
And we don't have to even write
these-- do anything with

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,480
these parentheses.

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,225
We can eliminate them.

19
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:45,760
Just because there's a positive
sign out here we

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,130
don't have to distribute
anything.

21
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,670
Distributing a positive
sign doesn't do

22
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,980
anything to these numbers.

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,490
So then plus, we have a
negative 2x squared.

24
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,600
So this term right here
is negative 2x

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,440
squared, or minus x squared.

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,590
And then we have a plus x.

27
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,890
We have a plus x.

28
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,940
   

29
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,435
Then we have a minus 2.

30
00:01:06,435 --> 00:01:09,340
   

31
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,180
Then we have a negative sign
times this whole expression.

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,730
So we're going to have to
distribute the negative sign.

33
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,190
So it's a positive 3x, but
it's being multiplied by

34
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,250
negative 1.

35
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,480
So it's really a negative 3x.

36
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,040
So minus 3x, then you have a
negative-- you can imagine

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,240
this is a negative 1 implicitly
out here-- negative

38
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,090
1 times negative 4.

39
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,570
That's a positive 4.

40
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,820
So plus 4.

41
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,410
   

42
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,020
Now, we could combine
terms of similar

43
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,260
degree, of the same degree.

44
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,360
Now, first we have an x to the
third term and I think it's

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,150
the only third degree term here,
because we have x being

46
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,760
raised to the third power.

47
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,770
So let me just rewrite
it here.

48
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,835
We have x to the third.

49
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:48,400
And now let's look at our x
squared terms. Looks like we

50
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
only have one.

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,340
We only have this
term right here.

52
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,740
So we have minus 2x squared.

53
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,130
And then what about
our x terms?

54
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,980
We have a 3x plus an
x minus a 3x again.

55
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,143
So that 3x minus the 3x would
cancel out, and you're just

56
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:05,490
left with an x.

57
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,490
So plus x.

58
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,620
And then finally our constant
terms. Negative 6

59
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,810
minus 2 plus 4.

60
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,790
Negative 6 minus 2 gets
us to negative 8.

61
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,150
Plus 4 is negative 4.

62
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,850
And we are done.

63
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,560
We have simplified
the expression.

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,570
Now we just have a four
term polynomial.

65
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,333
