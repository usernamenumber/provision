1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:01,881
I wasn't serious when I came up with this idea,

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:04,604
but you know how these things get out of... hand.

3
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,036
All right, listen up-each of my fingers is a digit,

4
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:09,125
but instead of a ones, tens, hundreds, thousands place

5
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,286
which are the power of ten, try it again

6
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:13,444
with ones, twos, fours, eights, sixteens and remember count it one to eight.

7
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:16,134
Now instead of ones and zeros, let's use your fingers: one, two, three.

8
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:17,635
This is how you count with your hands in binary

9
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:20,039
i'm gonna make it easy and write the place values on my fingertips

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:20,875
count the ones you see.

11
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:22,129
Four plus two, that's six.

12
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:24,126
Sixteen plus two is eighteen, and you can do it up.

13
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:26,144
Or dance it down put those digits on the ground.

14
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:27,012
Now do it with me.

15
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:38,104
One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight.

16
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:50,704
Hands at one... two... three... four... five... six... seven...eight.

17
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:53,290
Now, pi in binary looks something like this.

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,678
One, one, point zero zero one, zero zero one, dot dot dot.

19
00:00:57,678 --> 00:00:58,630
It's not what we're doing.

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,148
We're taking the decimal version and putting each digit in binary.

21
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:02,567
Now let's dance us some pi.

22
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,436
We got three, one, four.

23
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:07,454
I've got my bro doing three, one, four.

24
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:10,287
Got my mama doing three, one, four.

25
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:12,441
Even my grandma's doing three, one, four.

26
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:36,047
All right, one,

27
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:36,684
two,

28
00:01:36,684 --> 00:01:37,384
three,

29
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:38,060
four,

30
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,731
five,

31
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,483
six,

32
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:40,213
seven,

33
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:40,930
eight,

34
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,614
nine,

35
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:42,270
ten,

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,014
eleven,

37
00:01:43,014 --> 00:01:43,781
twelve,

38
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:44,462
thirteen,

39
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:45,183
fourteen,

40
00:01:45,183 --> 00:01:45,882
fifteen,

41
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:46,547
sixteen,

42
00:01:46,547 --> 00:01:47,364
seventeen,

43
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:48,064
eighteen,

44
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:48,829
nineteen,

45
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:49,455
twenty,

46
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:49,984
twenty-one,

47
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:50,608
twenty-two,

48
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:51,462
twenty-three,

49
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:52,032
twenty-four,

50
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:52,665
twenty-five,

51
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:53,395
twenty-six,

52
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:54,281
twenty-seven,

53
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,114
twenty-eight,

54
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:55,885
twenty-nine,

55
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:56,497
thirty,

56
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:58,560
thirty-one, oh!
