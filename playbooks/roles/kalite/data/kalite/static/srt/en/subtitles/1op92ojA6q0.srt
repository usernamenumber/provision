1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,405
In which quadrant is the point -7, 7 located?

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,000
So let's just review what a quadrant is

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,287
A quadrant is each of the four sections of the coordinate plane.

4
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:14,241
and when we talk about the sections we're talking about the sections

5
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:16,990
as divided by the coordinate axis.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,252
So this right here is the x-axis, and this up down axis is the y-axis,

7
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:25,600
and you can see it divides the coordinate plane into four sections.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,338
We call each of these sections quadrants

9
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:33,021
This one over here where both the x values and y values are positive

10
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:38,262
we call the first quadrant, and we use the roman numeral 1.

11
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:42,464
Then if we move counterclockwise around the coordinate plane

12
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:47,467
This quadrant, where the x values are negative and the y values are positive

13
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:50,071
we call the second quadrant.

14
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:54,179
We call this the second quadrant.

15
00:00:56,441 --> 00:01:01,400
Then we go down here, where both the x values are negative and the y values are negative,

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,000
we call this the third quadrant.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,821
Once again using roman numerals.

18
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:08,671
Then finally the quadrant where the x values are positive but the y values are

19
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:11,610
negative, we call this the fourth quadrant.

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,529
So let's see which quadrant the point -7, 7 is located.

21
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:19,482
So there's two ways to think about it, you could just say look: We have a negative

22
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:24,867
x value, our x value is negative, so we're gonna move to the left, we're gonna be on this side.

23
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:28,667
We're going to be on this of the coordinate plane.

24
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:31,446
So just by the fact that the x value is negative, we're gonna be in either

25
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:33,518
the second or the third quadrant.

26
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:38,867
Now we know that the y value is positive, we know that the y value is positive.

27
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:43,067
So if the x value is negative, and the y value is positive, we're gonna land

28
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:46,600
some place right overe here in the second quadrant.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,200
The other way to think about it is that you can literally just plot this point

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,667
and see that it falls in the second quadrant, so let's do that.

31
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:57,282
If x is negative 7, so it's negative 1. Negative 2. Negative 3. Negative 4,

32
00:01:57,282 --> 00:02:00,031
Negative 5. Negative 6. Negative 7.

33
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:00,948
Did I do that right?

34
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:03,764
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven.

35
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:09,133
So x is negative 7, and then we have to go up 7, because y is positive 7.

36
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:14,631
So one. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven.

37
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:20,467
So the point -7, 7 is right over here.

38
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:24,000
Clearly lies in the second quadrant.
