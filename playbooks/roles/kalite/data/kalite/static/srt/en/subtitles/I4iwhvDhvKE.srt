1
00:00:00,204 --> 00:00:02,576
There's a very popular and I thought, good movie, out

2
00:00:02,576 --> 00:00:04,042
based on the play,

3
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:06,503
which is based on the novel by Victor Hugo,

4
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:08,036
Les Miserables

5
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:09,383
and I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.

6
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:13,500
It means The Miserable, for who it was not obvious.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,373
And what I want to give is a bit of context

8
00:00:15,373 --> 00:00:19,692
because, in that book/play/movie

9
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:21,782
there is an attempted revolution, and sometimes

10
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:25,079
people try to associate it with the French Revolution.

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,248
But that is not depicting

12
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:29,830
the French Revolution that people talk about

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,767
when they talk about the French Revolution.

14
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:34,033
So I thought I would give a little bit of a scaffold

15
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:36,867
of French history in the late 1700s

16
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,779
and all the way through the mid 1800s.

17
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:41,101
To give a little bit of context on the matter.

18
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:43,767
So let's start off in 1789.

19
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:49,433
1789. That's when you have the French Revolution.

20
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,900
The First French Revolution, you could say.

21
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,449
Or the French Revolution,

22
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:55,572
which is the French Revolution that people talk about,

23
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,503
when they're talking about the French Revolution.

24
00:00:57,503 --> 00:01:00,635
It was all about deposing Louis 16th

25
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:03,033
and his wife, Marie Antoinette

26
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:06,033
This is her body there, I think she just got guillotined.

27
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,501
This is her head, it was a very bloody revolution.

28
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:13,535
This is the storming of the Bastille. Right over here.

29
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:15,436
And that starts the beginning

30
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:18,075
of the First Republic in France.

31
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:19,714
The First Republic.

32
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:22,717
So there were all these dreams and aspirations that

33
00:01:22,717 --> 00:01:25,488
France would now be a country of the people,

34
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:29,120
and not too dissimilar to the United States.

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,401
But, revolutions are not so easy or so clean or so fast

36
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:36,681
and France had to go through several,

37
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,909
of a long period of pain before it could

38
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:42,782
really establish itself as a real republic.

39
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:46,274
But let's keep going on... further off in history.

40
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:47,510
Let me do that in a different color.

41
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,494
Put the timeline in white.

42
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:54,433
So let's fast forward to 1799.

43
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:57,582
1799.

44
00:01:57,582 --> 00:02:01,056
This is when Napoleon Bonaparte comes to power.

45
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:02,677
So when people talk about Napoleon,

46
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:04,496
they are talking about Napoleon Bonaparte.

47
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:06,040
We'll see there are other Napoleons

48
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,497
but people just say hey, Napoleon did this or that,

49
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:10,647
they're talking about Napoleon Bonaparte.

50
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:14,274
So this is Napoleon comes to power. Napoleon...

51
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:17,325
And he officially ends the first Republic, in 1804

52
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:20,566
because he declares himself emperor.

53
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:21,891
But let's fast forward.

54
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,781
There's many videos on the Khan Academy dealing with

55
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:26,068
the Napoleonic wars and the French Revolution

56
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:29,525
but let's fast forward to 1815.

57
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,907
So let me do that in white again.

58
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:33,579
So you get to 1815.

59
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:36,263
So that was about, 10 years, and this is about, 16 years.

60
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:40,095
So this is.. let's put 1815 right over there

61
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:47,900
1815 is essentially Napoleon faces his Waterloo

62
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,500
which is literally at Waterloo

63
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,786
that's why people talk about "facing your Waterloo".

64
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:55,997
So that was... he was banished a little bit at Elba

65
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:57,357
he was able to come back

66
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,633
He had 100, actually 111 days in power

67
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,186
But then he was finally defeated.

68
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:06,453
And then he was finally put into exile at St. Helena,

69
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,944
where he died.

70
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,450
And 1815, you essentially have

71
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,718
the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy.

72
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:17,601
So Louis 16th's younger brother

73
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:24,105
comes to power, and they call him Louis 18th.

74
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:27,033
So this is Louis the 18th.

75
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,378
Which raises a very good question:

76
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:30,500
what happened to Louis 17th?

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,157
Louis 17th was Louis 16th's son, who died in prison

78
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:39,210
at the age of 10 in 1795, during the Revolution.

79
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,481
So let's keep...

80
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,859
Or during the Revolutionary period, I guess we could say.

81
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:46,927
So this right over here, this right over here, let me draw..

82
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,514
this is Napoleon's...

83
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:52,224
Let me do this in the same color as I did Napoleon, right

84
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:55,875
So 1799 to 18...

85
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,206
actually 1814 is when Napoleon's reign ended

86
00:03:58,206 --> 00:03:59,570
but he then came back for a little bit,

87
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,209
so I'll draw a little bit of dotted line here

88
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,429
A little dotted line

89
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:07,032
And then 1814 was the formal restoration

90
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:09,499
of the Bourbon Monarchy

91
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,706
And then of course Napoleon comes back a bit.

92
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:15,751
But after Waterloo, it's really firmly, firmly established.

93
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:18,166
So you have the restoration of the Bourbon Monarchy.

94
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,508
So this is Louis 18th.

95
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:25,629
And then in 1824, he dies. And he dies childless.

96
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:30,252
1824. So let's see, it's about 9 years.

97
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:34,149
I will put this about right over there. 1824.

98
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,186
He dies childless, and so his younger brother,

99
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:39,899
Charles 10th comes to power.

100
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,962
So then you have Charles 10th

101
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:46,732
I'll do all the Bourbons in purple.

102
00:04:46,732 --> 00:04:48,592
Charles X.

103
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:52,735
And this is Charles X right over here.

104
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:57,281
And so let's go a little bit further off into history.

105
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:01,366
You fast forward all the way to 1830.

106
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:05,274
You fast forward to 1830

107
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:06,830
A lot of discontent.

108
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,701
And now you have the Second French Revolution.

109
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,093
You might say,

110
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:12,774
ho hey, this must be what Les Miserables is about.

111
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:14,068
NO. We're not there yet.

112
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:17,900
Les Mis is not about the 2nd French Revolution,

113
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,830
which is sometimes called the July Revolution.

114
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,551
July Revolution

115
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:25,167
And this revolution actually did not, it was successful,

116
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,933
but it did not establish a republic at this point.

117
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,484
Instead, it installed.. and this whole time,

118
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:32,465
there was kind of a liberalization.

119
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,230
The monarchy, even when it was put in power

120
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,970
had a kind of gradual decline in how much power it had.

121
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,433
But after the July Revolution, they put in

122
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:42,833
Charles X's cousin.

123
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:47,233
Charles X's cousin, who was the Duke of Orleans.

124
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:52,574
The Duke of Orleans, who was this guy right over here.

125
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:55,550
Louis Phillipe the 1st.

126
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:06,029
So let me write that, so this is Louis Phillipe the 1st

127
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:07,185
And so you're saying,

128
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:10,134
Sal, you started off this video talking about Les Mis

129
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:12,589
and you haven't mentioned Les Mis yet!

130
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,168
Give me a little bit of context.

131
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:15,433
So now I will give you context.

132
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:16,908
So if you watched the movie,

133
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,767
it starts off with Jean Valjean

134
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:20,855
he's at like a shipping place,

135
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:24,199
where they're repairing ships of some sort.

136
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,311
That was in 1815, after Waterloo.

137
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:32,326
So it was under Louis 18th's regime.

138
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,348
So that's right over here.

139
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,834
Let me see where the start of the movie

140
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:40,519
The start of the movie is right... right about there.

141
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,978
And then the real climax of the movie

142
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:44,768
which is this rebellion,

143
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:49,263
there's these barricades being set up in Paris,

144
00:06:49,263 --> 00:06:50,947
you have all these young, idealistic folks

145
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:53,667
were trying to overthrow the government.

146
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:56,848
This does not happen until 1832.

147
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,983
This is 1832.

148
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:00,329
I'll do it right over here.

149
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:02,977
1832.

150
00:07:02,977 --> 00:07:04,767
And what catalyzed it,

151
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,509
there were several things that were catalyzing that

152
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,150
And actually,

153
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,279
most revolutions are catalyzed by just...

154
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,488
economic discontent. If people are rich and happy, and

155
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:13,222
have jobs and aren't getting sick,

156
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:15,877
most people won't be in the mood to revolt.

157
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:18,550
But in 1832, as you can imagine,

158
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,129
the economic situation was not good.

159
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:25,984
There was also a very nasty outbreak of cholera

160
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:29,480
and what really catalyzed the events in Les Mis

161
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,410
and they even referred to it in the movie

162
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,266
is the death of this chap right over here.

163
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:38,503
Jean Maximilien Lamarque

164
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:40,346
Let me write them down, write the name down

165
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:48,113
Jean Maximilien...And I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.

166
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:49,481
Lamarque

167
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:55,833
And he dies in June of 1832.

168
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,926
And he was very sympathetic to the plight of the poor

169
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:00,841
to the plight of the common man.

170
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:04,542
and he... kind of the average folks

171
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:06,506
because it said, "Hey, look, he's our guy in government"

172
00:08:06,506 --> 00:08:08,828
and he had kind of an influential role in government.

173
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:11,637
So when he died, they're like,

174
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,975
"look, we don't have anybody else

175
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:17,652
kind of in a high position who can speak for us.

176
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:21,632
Let's use his funeral as a catalyst for revolt."

177
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:25,315
And you saw that happening in the movie, Les Mis.

178
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:27,497
So Les Mis, in that climactic moment

179
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:30,980
that is the June rebellion of 1832.

180
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,807
And it's not, you don't have to

181
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:35,688
have amazing comprehension of watching movies

182
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:38,277
to realize that this was unsuccessful.

183
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:42,539
So this right here, didn't work. Didn't work.

184
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,585
If it did work,

185
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:46,847
it might have been called the Third French Revolution.

186
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,631
But it was not, it was an unsuccessful revolution,

187
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:52,250
or unsuccessful rebellion really.

188
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,483
And as Victor Hugo observed it, and that's why

189
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,925
he was able to recount it in so much detail.

190
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:58,601
The barricading, the young people,

191
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:00,841
the shooting in the streets, all the rest.

192
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,327
So just as a little bit of review.

193
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:05,160
When people talk about the French Revolution,

194
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,575
they're usually talking about the

195
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:09,943
French Revolution 1789, which establishes or

196
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:13,658
begins to establish the First Republic.

197
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:15,655
It was a successful revolution.

198
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,256
The second French Revolution,

199
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:19,974
this is the July Revolution,

200
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:26,244
this is in 1830, this puts into power Louis Phillipe the 1st,

201
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:29,633
the person that they're trying to overthrow in Les Mis

202
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:33,163
And they don't establish the Second Republic after this.

203
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:34,700
For the Second Republic, we have to go

204
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,781
all the way to the Revolution

205
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:41,643
we have to go all the way to the Revolution... of

206
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:44,180
Let me make sure I can scroll properly

207
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,735
Go all the way... let me continue my timeline.

208
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:49,618
So this is Louis Phillipe 1st

209
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:55,709
to go 18 years to 1848

210
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,550
where you have the Third French Revolution.

211
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:05,916
So Third French Revolution

212
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,900
which leads to the popular election of

213
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,307
Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew.

214
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:17,241
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte.

215
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,835
This guy right over here.

216
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,502
But France is still not done.

217
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:26,662
It still can't establish itself as a long and lasting republic.

218
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:30,833
In 1851 this character declares himself emperor.

219
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,408
So 1851, he too declares himself emperor.

220
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:39,033
And France is not finally free of kings and emperors

221
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:43,324
until 1870.

222
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:48,401
So let's do this run all the way to 1870.

223
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:52,035
Where France essentially loses the Franco-Prussian war

224
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:56,663
And this character right over here is deposed, and

225
00:10:56,663 --> 00:11:02,309
you have the establishment of the Third French Republic.
