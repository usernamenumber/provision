00:00:00,705 --> 00:00:06,432
The whole point of this video is really just to look at, what in my mind is one of the coolest pictures

2
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:09,683
ever taken by anything, and this was actually taken by the Hubble telescope

3
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:18,228
and what they did is, they pointed the telescope at this area of our night sky

4
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:21,200
and obviously the Hubble telescope, it's out in orbit, so it doesn't have to worry about

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,222
all the interference from our actual atmosphere, so it gets a nice good look at things,

6
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:30,766
but it's right over here, relative to the moon, and obviously the moon is moving around,

7
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:33,692
but on that day, it was here, relative to the moon

8
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:37,361
and they picked this location. They picked this location right over here

9
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:40,751
because there weren't that many nearby stars there so

10
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:45,767
it really allowed the telescope, because if there were nearby stars that light would've kind of outshone

11
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:51,432
things that are behind it further away maybe perhaps galaxies. So just keep in mind everything you're

12
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:56,356
going to see is in this little patch of the night sky, and I think the main point for showing the moon

13
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,791
here. Obviously the moon is moving around so I'm not going to tell you which exact patch of sky this

14
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:05,364
is. But to really give you an idea of how small of a patch of sky that really is. You really could've

15
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:09,451
done this with any patch of sky, but in other patches of sky there wouldve been nearby stars that would've

16
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:13,445
blocked things, but the galaxies are there, beyond that. The clusters of galaxies, and the super clusters

17
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:18,414
of galaxies. So with that said out of the way, just remember everything we're talking about in this video

18
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:24,776
is in this little patch of sky right over here. The whole point of this, once again like all of these

19
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:32,133
videos is really to kind of just blow your mind. So this right here is what the Hubble telescope saw in that

20
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:37,467
patch. Everything, everything that I'm showing you right here. I just want to be clear, some of these

21
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:45,117
things are nearby stars, but most of these things are galaxies. That's a galaxy. That is a galaxy. That

22
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:51,467
is a galaxy. That's a galaxy, and that's a galaxy. The reason I want to draw you this, obviously in the

23
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:56,773
last video I showed you our local group, I showed you the Virgo super cluster, I showed you the kind of

24
00:01:56,773 --> 00:02:02,764
clusters of clusters and I even showed you the depiction of the observable universe. But what is amazing

25
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:08,290
about this, is this is an actual picture. This is actually an image of a galaxy. Hey there is another

26
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,375
galaxy. Oh look there's another galaxy up here. That you can keep doing that forever and this is just

27
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:18,089
in that little patch of sky, and this is obviously not all of the galaxies of the universe. These are

28
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:22,687
just the ones that we could see. There ones that might be even further, or there definitely are ones

29
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:27,702
that are further back and their light is just even more. We could probably even focus on a patch of sky

30
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:33,786
like that and see that many galaxies again. You can kind of keep, keep zooming in, but I just this thing,

31
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:39,080
and I encourage you I mean there's so many unbelievable images you can look up. They're all on NASA's

32
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,333
website, a lot of these are on Wikipedia. But these images are just unbelievable. You can see a galaxy,

33
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:52,455
another galaxy, another galaxy, another galaxy. I suspect some of this stuff might actually be clusters

34
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:59,374
of galaxies. Galaxy, another galaxy. And remember I'm just circling these galaxies, just left and right,

35
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:04,761
and you kind of lose sight of what each galaxy actually is. These galaxies have hundred of billions

36
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:13,956
of stars. That even from you know one pixel on these galaxies is unimaginable distance. Something that

37
00:03:13,956 --> 00:03:19,133
we could never, based with current technology, or even current science, we could ever hope to traverse

38
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:25,798
in the lifetime of humanity. Not, much left in a lifetime of one individual. So these are just

39
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:31,133
enormous things, and they're just an infinite number of them. So I just wanted to highlight this with

40
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:42,099
you, and really just look at it. Its kind of breathtaking. Another galaxy right over there. I'm not going

41
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,418
to keep doing it the whole day. I feel kind of bad for drawing on it, it kind of ruins the picture. But

42
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:52,780
look at that, that's a nice looking galaxy right there. You got a bunch right over here. It really is

43
00:03:52,780 --> 00:04:03,368
just, you know. This video its probably the least dense with actual instruction, but hopefully the

44
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:08,755
most dense with inspiration. Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that. Let me just finish looking at the entire

45
00:04:08,755 --> 99:59:59,999
picture. I mean it just keeps going ,and going we can keep looking at it.
