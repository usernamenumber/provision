1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:06,210
Welcome to the second set of presentations

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,630
on age word problems.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,190
I have one typed out here.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,230
Let's see what it says.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,520
It says, Salman- that's me- is one hundred and eight years old.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,490
And so this is clearly at some vast time in the future.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,370
And this'll only happen if my caloric restriction works out.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,360
But Salman is one hundred and eight years old.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,210
Jonathan is twenty-four years old.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,200
How many years will it take for Salman to be exactly four

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,920
times as old as Jonathan?

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,700
Well, let's figure this one out.

13
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,230
What we're trying to solve for is how many years will it take.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,740
So let's use the variable y, for years.

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:53,880
So y equals years until, let's just say Sal, for short.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,270
Sal is four times Jonathan's age.

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,260
Well, if today, I, or Sal, if Salman, it's hard to speak

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,420
in the third person.

19
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,830
If Salman is one hundred years old today, in y years, Salman

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:25,940
will be one hundred and eight plus y is equal to Sal in y years.

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,910
We'll say y years.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,670
Sal in y years is going to be one hundred and eight plus y.

23
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,320
And then Jonathan in y years, that's pretty easy.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,710
He's going to be twenty-four plus y.

25
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,670
So that's, I'll say Jon for short.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,430
In y years.

27
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,860
Not years.

28
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,180
y years.

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,250
And what else does the problem say?

30
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,760
It says, in how many years would take for Salman to be

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,600
exactly-- I should put that in another color for emphasis--

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,890
Exactly four times as old as Jonathan?

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,760
Well, and the exactly is important.

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,210
Because Salman is already more than four times

35
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,330
as old as Jonathan.

36
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,590
But they want to figure out exactly when is Salman going to

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,880
be four times as old as Jonathan.

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,440
Well, in y years Salman is going to be one hundred and eight plus y.

39
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,180
So we know that.

40
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,800
one hundred and eight plus y.

41
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,490
And after y years, he's going to be four times

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,670
as old as Jonathan.

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,460
Exactly four times.

44
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,740
And Jonathan's going to be twenty-four plus y years old.

45
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,680
And now we just solve the equation.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,490
Get one hundred and eight plus y is equal to four times twenty-four.

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,290
Well, four times twenty-five is one hundred.

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,660
And we can subtract four from there.

49
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,110
So it's ninety-six.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,380
Plus foury.

51
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,020
And now we just solve this equation.

52
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,810
We get three.

53
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,980
three, I'm going to skip some steps, because I think this

54
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,380
part is easy for you.

55
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,900
threey will equal one hundred and eight minus ninety-six.

56
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:13,930
So we get threey is equal to, what is that, twelve, right?

57
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,770
So y is equal to four.

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,630
So our algebra has told us that in four years Salman is going

59
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,250
to be exactly four times as old as Jonathan.

60
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,620
Let's see if that's true.

61
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,460
Well, if Salman is one hundred and eight right now, in four years

62
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,770
he's going to be one hundred and twelve.

63
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,900
And if Jonathan is twenty-four right now, in four years he's

64
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,610
going to be twenty-eight.

65
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,530
And let's see.

66
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,770
twenty-eight times four is eighty plus thirty-two.

67
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,720
Yep, exactly.

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,980
He'll be one hundred and twelve.

69
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,770
Looks like that problem worked.

70
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,910
Excellent.

71
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,020
Let's do another one.

72
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,510
Hope you didn't hear that, it was my stomach growling.

73
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,230
See how hard I work on this site?

74
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,210
Don't even eat properly.

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,800
Let's do another problem.

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,530
I'll type it in green this time.

77
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:23,660
Tarush is five times as old as Arman is today, eighty-five years ago.

78
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,610
We're dealing with huge swathes of time.

79
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,920
eighty-five years ago.

80
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:39,180
Tarush was ten times as old as Arman.

81
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,720
How old is Arman today?

82
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,970
Let's see if we can tackle this quite interesting

83
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,080
problem, I think.

84
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,630
Settings.

85
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,960
Pen tool on.

86
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,310
OK.

87
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,370
Well, I think this might be useful to do one of those

88
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,010
charts like we did in the first video presentation.

89
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,970
Well, we're trying to solve for how old is Arman today's.

90
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,740
So let's say Arman.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,680
And we're going to have today.

92
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,600
And we're going to have, what's the other time

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,470
period we're dealing with.

94
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,010
We're dealing with eighty-five years ago.

95
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,080
So, let's say.

96
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,040
eighty-five years ago.

97
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,870
In a galaxy far, far away.

98
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:34,870
OK, Arman and Tarush.

99
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
Well, we're trying to solve for how old is Arman today's.

100
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,270
So let's just make that x, for simplicity.

101
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,140
It says Tarush is five times as old as Arman today.

102
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,540
So let me underline that.

103
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,300
Tarush is five times as old as Arman today.

104
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,890
So if Arman is x, that tells us that Tarush is going to be fivex.

105
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,320
eighty-five years ago.

106
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:03,190
So, eighty-five years ago, well, Arman is x today, then eighty-five years ago,

107
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,970
Arman would have been x minus eighty-five.

108
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,220
And if Tarush is fivex today, then Tarush would be fivex minus eighty-five.

109
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,140
I just subtracted eighty-five from the current age.

110
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,620
Because we're going eighty-five years in the past.

111
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,470
And now we have this extra piece of information.

112
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,490
Which tells us that eighty-five years ago, Tarush was ten

113
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,420
times as old as Arman.

114
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,930
So this number is going to be ten times more than this number.

115
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,320
That's what that sentence tells us.

116
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,030
eighty-five years ago, we're in this situation.

117
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,320
Tarush, which is this, was ten times older than Arman.

118
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,570
We just write that out algebraically.

119
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:54,220
eighty-five years ago, Tarush is fivex minus eighty-five.

120
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,360
And the sentence tells us that he was ten times older than

121
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,620
Arman, who is x minus eighty-five.

122
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,380
Now we just solve the equation.

123
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:14,880
We get fivex minus eighty-five is equal to tenx minus eight hundred and fifty.

124
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,890
And then you get-- and I'm going to do this, skip some

125
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:24,820
steps, just to confuse you-- fivex is equal too-- well, I think

126
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,360
I just confused myself.

127
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:34,790
fivex is equal to eight hundred and fifty minus eighty-five.

128
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,390
Let's see, what's eight hundred and fifty minus eighty-five.

129
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,220
It'll be thirty-five less than eight hundred.

130
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,490
So we could say that fivex-- thirty-five less than eight hundred.

131
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,250
thirty less than eight hundred gets seven hundred and seventy.

132
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,060
So seven hundred and sixty-five.

133
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,570
And then x is equal to, let me see.

134
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,510
five goes into seventy.

135
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,130
one times five.

136
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,250
twenty-six.

137
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,220
five times five is twenty-five.

138
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,580
fifteen.

139
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,800
So x is equal to one hundred and fifty-three.

140
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,240
We have some long-lifespanned people.

141
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,000
So we get the solution that Arman is one hundred and fifty-three years old.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,180
Today.

143
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,990
Let's see if that makes sense.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,300
Well, if he's one hundred and fifty-three, then, no, that can't be right.

145
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,360
Because then he's five.

146
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,220
Huh.

147
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,890
Well, actually I'm almost out of time.

148
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,180
Let me see where I might have messed up on this.

149
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,310
If Arman is x, Tarush is fivex.

150
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,820
That makes sense.

151
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, right, right, right.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,730
I think this could make sense.

153
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,220
So, I thought that Tarush had to be younger than Arman.

154
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,100
But no, Tarush is five times one hundred and fifty-three.

155
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,620
So Tarush is actually seven hundred and sixty-five years old.

156
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,380
We should call him Methuselah.

157
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,180
So, Tarush is seven hundred and sixty-five years old.

158
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,110
And then if we go eighty-five years into the past, Tarush would have

159
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,030
been-- what did we say?

160
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,750
If we go eighty-five years into the past, so let's write this down.

161
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,810
This is equal to, I'm about to run out of time, so you might

162
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,110
have to check this yourself.

163
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,000
If that's equal to one hundred and fifty-three, then fivex is equal to seven hundred and sixty-five.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,410
These numbers are big.

165
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,690
And then one hundred and fifty-three minus eighty-five.

166
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,700
Well, one hundred and fifty-five minus eighty-five would be seventy-three.

167
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,830
So this would be seventy-two.

168
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,240
And then Tarush, eighty-five years ago.

169
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,540
No, I think I messed up someplace.

170
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,140
Well, actually, I only have ten seconds before YouTube

171
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,120
won't let me upload it.

172
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,440
So we'll have to stop there.

173
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,950
Thank you.
