1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
   

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,300
Welcome to the presentation
on torque.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,060
So, if you watched the
presentation on the center of

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,690
mass, which you should have, you
might have gotten a little

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,850
bit of a glancing view
of what torque is.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,350
And now we'll do some
more in detail.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:19,680
So in general, from the center
of mass video, we learned, if

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,745
this is a ruler and this is the
ruler's center of mass.

9
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:26,330
   

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:32,259
And if I were to apply force at
the center of mass, I would

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,820
accelerate the whole ruler in
the direction of the force.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,810
If I have the force applying at
the center of mass there,

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,240
the whole ruler would accelerate
in that direction.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,510
And we'd figure it out by
taking the force we're

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,000
applying to it and dividing
by the mass of the ruler.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,020
And in that center of mass
video, I imply-- well, what

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,040
happens if the force
is applied here?

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,050
Away from the center of mass?

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,960
Well, in this situation, the
object, assuming it's a free

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,750
floating object on the Space
Shuttle or something, it will

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,450
rotate around the
center of mass.

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,410
And that's also true, if we
didn't use the center of mass,

23
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,810
but instead we fixed
the point.

24
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:14,110
Let's say we had
another ruler.

25
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,310
Although it has less height
than the previous one.

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,160
Instead of worrying about its
center of mass, let's say that

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,930
it's just fixed at
a point here.

28
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,980
Let's say it's fixed here.

29
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,450
So if this could be the hand
of a clock, and it's nailed

30
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,510
down to the back of the
clock right there.

31
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,160
So if we were trying to rotate
it, it would always rotate

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,170
around this point.

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,800
And the same thing
would happen.

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,830
If I were to apply a force at
this point, maybe I could

35
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,550
break the nail off the back of
the clock, or something, but I

36
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,830
won't rotate this needle or
this rule, or whatever you

37
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,770
want to call it.

38
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,440
But if I would apply a force
here, I would rotate the ruler

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,440
around the pivot point.

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,010
And this force that's applied a
distance away from the pivot

41
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,080
point, or we could say from the
axis of rotation, or the

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,190
center of mass.

43
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,770
That's called torque.

44
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,949
And torque, the letter for
torque is this Greek, I think

45
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,860
that's tau, it's a curvy T.

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,640
And torque is defined as
force times distance.

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,560
And what force and what
distance is it?

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,030
It's the force that's
perpendicular to the object.

49
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,960
I guess you could say to
the distance vector.

50
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,170
If this is the distance vector--
let me do it in a

51
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,110
different color.

52
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,790
If this is the distance vector,
the component of the

53
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,750
force is perpendicular to
this distance vector.

54
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,100
And this is torque.

55
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,320
And so what are its units?

56
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,810
Well, force is newtons, and
distance is meters, so this is

57
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,570
newton meters.

58
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,010
And you're saying, hey Sal,
newtons times meters, force

59
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,440
times distance, that looks
an awful lot like work.

60
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,840
And it's very important to
realize that this isn't work,

61
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,300
and that's why we won't
call this joules.

62
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,130
Because in work, what
are we doing?

63
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,010
We are translating an object.

64
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,960
If this is an object, and I'm
applying a force, I'm taking

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,610
the force over the distance
in the same

66
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,000
direction as the force.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,880
Here the distance and
the force are

68
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,750
parallel to each other.

69
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,910
You could say the distance
vector and the force vector

70
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,850
are in the same direction.

71
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,090
Of course, that's
translational.

72
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,350
The whole object
is just moving.

73
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,940
It's not rotating or anything.

74
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,340
In the situation of torque,
let me switch colors.

75
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,000
The distance vector, this is the
distance from the fulcrum

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,770
or the pivot point of the center
of mass, to where I'm

77
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,840
applying the force.

78
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,640
This distance vector is
perpendicular to the force

79
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,790
that's being applied.

80
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,930
So torque and work are
fundamentally two different

81
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,940
things, even though their
units are the same.

82
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,660
And this is a little
bit of notational.

83
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,610
This distance is often called
the moment arm distance.

84
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,960
And I don't know where
that came from.

85
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,250
Maybe one of you all can write
me a message saying where it

86
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,180
did come from.

87
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,200
And often in some of your
physics classes they'll often

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,400
call torque as a moment.

89
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,970
But we'll deal with
the term torque.

90
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,280
And that's more fun, because
eventually we can understand

91
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,630
concepts like torque
horsepower in cars.

92
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,230
So let's do a little bit of
math, hopefully I've given you

93
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,930
a little bit of intuition.

94
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:23,510
So let's say I had this ruler.

95
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,780
And let's say that this is its
pivot point right here.

96
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,960
So it would rotate around
that point.

97
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,220
It's nailed to the wall
or something.

98
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,990
And let's say that I apply a
force-- Let's say the moment

99
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,760
arm distance.

100
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,532
So let's say this distance,
let me do it

101
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,690
in different color.

102
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:49,740
Let's say that this distance
right here is 10 meters.

103
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,300
And I were to apply a force of 5
newtons perpendicular to the

104
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,710
distance vector, or to dimension
of the moment arm,

105
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,040
you could view it either way.

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,300
So torque is pretty easy
in this situation.

107
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:11,580
Torque is going to be equal to
the force, 5 newtons, times

108
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,010
the distance, 10.

109
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,816
So it would be 50
newton meters.

110
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,910
And you're probably saying,
well, Sal, how do I know if

111
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,490
this torque is going to be
positive or negative?

112
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,880
And this is where there's just a
general arbitrary convention

113
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,550
in physics.

114
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,190
And it's good to know.

115
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,150
If you're rotating clockwise
torque is negative.

116
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,990
Let me go the other way.

117
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,930
If you were rotating
counterclockwise, like we were

118
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,650
in this example, rotating
counterclockwise, the opposite

119
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,250
direction of which a clock
would move in.

120
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,560
Torque is positive.

121
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,540
And if you rotate clockwise
the other

122
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,250
way, torque is negative.

123
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,680
So clockwise is negative.

124
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,390
And I'm not going to go into
the whole cross product and

125
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,210
the linear algebra of torque
right now, because I think

126
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,790
that's a little bit
beyond the scope.

127
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,450
But we'll do that
once we do more

128
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,160
mathematically intensive physics.

129
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,190
But, so, good enough.

130
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,790
There's a torque of
50 newton meters.

131
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,390
And that's all of the torque
that is acting

132
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,040
on this object .

133
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,330
So it's going to rotate
in this direction.

134
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,910
And we don't have the tools yet
to figure out how quickly

135
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,660
it will rotate.

136
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,010
But we know it will rotate.

137
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,510
And that's vaguely useful.

138
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,100
But what if I said that the
object is not rotating?

139
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:24,940
And that I have another
force acting here?

140
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:35,180
And let's say that that force
is-- I don't know, let me make

141
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,570
up something, that's 5
meters to the left

142
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,820
of the pivot point.

143
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,000
   

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,130
If I were tell you that this
object does not rotate.

145
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,610
So if I tell you that the object
is not rotating, that

146
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,340
means the net torque on this
ruler must be 0, because it's

147
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,380
not-- its rate of change of
rotation is not changing.

148
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,860
I should be a little exact.

149
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,600
If I'm applying some force here,
and still not rotating,

150
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,020
then we know that the net torque
on this object is 0.

151
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,730
So what is the force
being applied here?

152
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,750
Well, what is the net torque?

153
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,170
Well, it's this torque, which
we already figured out.

154
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,740
It's going in the clockwise
direction.

155
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,340
So it's 5-- Let me do it
in a brighter color.

156
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,480
5 times 10.

157
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,960
And then the net torque.

158
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,580
The sum of all the torques
have to be equal to 0.

159
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,510
So what's this torque?

160
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,480
So let's call this f.

161
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,750
This is the force.

162
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,790
So, plus-- Well, this force is
acting in what direction?

163
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,110
Clockwise or counterclockwise?

164
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,810
Well, it's acting in the
clockwise direction.

165
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,710
This force wants to make the
ruler rotate this way.

166
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,040
So this is actually going
to be a negative torque.

167
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,570
So let's say, put a negative
number here times f, times its

168
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,630
moment arm distance, times
5, and all of this

169
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,930
has to equal 0.

170
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,300
The net torque is 0, because the
object's rate of change of

171
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,990
rotation isn't changing, or if
it started off not rotating,

172
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,660
it's still not rotating.

173
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:16,300
So here we get 50 minus
5 f is equal to 0.

174
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,440
That's 50 is equal to 5 f.

175
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,290
f is equal to 10.

176
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,700
If we follow the units all the
way through, we would get that

177
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,460
f is equal to 10 newtons.

178
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,220
So that's interesting.

179
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,289
I applied double the force
at half the distance.

180
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,409
And it offsetted half the force
at twice the distance.

181
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,059
And that should all connect, or
start to connect, with what

182
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,309
we talked about with mechanical
advantage.

183
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,270
You could view it
the other way.

184
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,160
Let's say these are people
applying these forces.

185
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,430
Say this guy over here is
applying 10 newtons.

186
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,410
He's much stronger.

187
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,240
He's twice as strong as
this guy over here.

188
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,310
But because this guy is twice
as far away from the pivot

189
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,820
point, he balances
the other guy.

190
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,810
So you can kind of view it
as this guy having some

191
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,340
mechanical advantage or having
a mechanical advantage of 2.

192
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,330
And watch the mechanical
advantage videos if that

193
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,910
confuses you a little bit.

194
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,550
But this is where to
torque is useful.

195
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,600
Because if an object's rate of
rotation is not changing, you

196
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,200
know that the net torque
on that object is 0.

197
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,910
And you can solve for the
forces or the distances.

198
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,460
I'm about to run out of
time, so I will see

199
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,380
you in the next video.

200
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:23,700
