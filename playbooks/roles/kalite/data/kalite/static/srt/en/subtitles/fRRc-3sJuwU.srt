1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,210
We are on number 11.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,290
Sonia customized her bicycle by exchanging the front wheel

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,560
for a wheel that had 1/2 the diameter of the back wheel.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,190
So this'll be a weird looking bicycle.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,160
We're going to have a small wheel in front,

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,370
and then-- let's see if I can draw a bicycle.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,860
Oh, it looks like it. I don't know.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,500
Then you have a huge wheel in the back, right?

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,550
Because the diameter of this wheel

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,280
is 1/2 of the diameter of that wheel.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,840
Now when Sonia rides the bicycle,

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,500
how many revolutions does the front wheel make

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,040
for each revolution of the back wheel?

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,890
All right.

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,180
When you do this problem,

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,550
how many revolutions does the front wheel make

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,740
for each revolution of the back wheel?

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,400
And let me just make sure it says that

19
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,990
the front wheel has 1/2 the diameter of the back wheel.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,940
So let me ask you a question.

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,540
If the back wheel goes around-- well,

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,090
that's essentially what it was just asking.

23
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,390
Let's make up numbers.

24
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,950
Let's say that the back wheel's diameter--

25
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,790
or let's say it's radius.

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,350
Let's say the back wheel has a radius of 2.

27
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,140
So then, what's its circumference?

28
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,500
Its circumference, for the back wheel, would be 2 pi r.

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,630
So it would be, 2 times pi times 2,

30
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,840
which is equal to 4 pi, right?

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,930
The circumference of this has 1/2 the diameter,

32
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,250
so it would also have 1/2 the radius.

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,100
So the circumference will just be 2 pi r,

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,910
which would be 2 pi.

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,570
So this one, if you have 1/2 the diameter,

36
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,410
you also have 1/2 the circumference.

37
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,850
And so when this wheel does 1 revolution,

38
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,990
how far has the bicycle traveled,

39
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,720
assuming the wheel hasn't skidded or anything

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,130
Well, when this back wheel does 1 revolution,

41
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,380
the bicycle would have traveled 4 pi,whatever our units.

42
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,040
4 pi feet, if that's our units, right?

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,090
So if the bicycle's traveled the 4 pi units.

44
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,000
It's going to travel 4 pi units

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,510
on the front of the bicycle as well.

46
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,660
So if we've traveled 4 pi units,how many times does

47
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,020
this wheel have to turn around to travel 4 pi units?

48
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,040
Well, in one revolution,this wheel, it's 2 pi.

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,070
So this wheel actually has to turn around twice.

50
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,770
It turns around twice

51
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,010
for every 1 revolution of the big wheel.

52
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,010
Hopefully that makes sense.

53
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,290
You just realize that 1 revolution of the big wheel

54
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,760
is going to be twice the circumference of the front wheel.

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,710
And so the front wheel has to turn around twice

56
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,200
when the bike goes over that same distance.

57
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,360
So the answer to their question is,

58
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,730
how many revolutions does the front wheel make

59
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,310
for each revolution of the back wheel?

60
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,470
Well, the answer is, C.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
That looks like an E, but the answer is C, 2.

62
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:57,930
Problem number 12. All right.

63
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,260
A list of numbers contains p positive and n negative numbers.

64
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,500
So p pos, n negative.

65
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,580
If a number is picked at random from the list,

66
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,370
the probability that the number is positive is 3/5.

67
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,720
What is the value of n/p?

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:31,250
OK, so the probability of getting a positive is 3/5.

69
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,250
So what is the probability of getting a positive?

70
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,930
Our probability of getting a positive

71
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,910
is going to be equal to p/n?

72
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,010
That's the probability of

73
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,410
the number of positive numbers we have

74
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,740
over the total numbers we have, right?

75
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,010
That's the probability of getting a positive number, right?

76
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,130
If this was red marbles and blue marbles,

77
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,090
the probability of getting a red marble would be

78
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:54,850
the number of red

79
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,590
over the total number of marbles,right?

80
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,780
So similar here.

81
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,930
It's the number of positive numbers over the total numbers.

82
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,250
And the total numbers

83
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,650
are the positive numbers plus the negative numbers.

84
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,340
And now, they are asking us for what is the value--

85
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,170
Well ,ok, I just want to make sure I'm doing it right.

86
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,540
If the number is picked at random from the list,

87
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,870
the probability that the number is positive-- right,

88
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,750
this is the probability that's positive is 3/5--

89
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,720
what is the value of n/p?

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,280
So now I'll solve for n/p.

91
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,160
So we could cross multiply here, right?

92
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,490
So we could say 5p is equal to 3 times this,

93
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,270
is equal to 3p plus 3n.

94
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,060
I just cross multiplied.

95
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,230
And then, let's see, subtract p from both sides.

96
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,300
You get 2p is equal to 3n.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,050
And we want to figure out n/p, right?

98
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,390
So let's divide both sides by p.

99
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,260
So you get 2 is equal to 3n/p.

100
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,510
And let's divide both sides by 3.

101
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,210
And you get 2/3 is equal to n/p.

102
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,320
And we are done.

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,190
n/p is equal to 2/3,which is choice C.

104
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,310
Wasn't too bad.

105
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:23,920
Problem 13. Clear image, invert colors.

106
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,900
And I will do it in this tacky green.

107
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,130
Problem 13.

108
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,030
The total daily cost, c, in dollars,

109
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,090
of producing x units of a certain product

110
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,070
is given by the function.

111
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,750
All right, we've got a cost function right here.

112
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:55,750
c of x is equal to 600x minus 200 over x plus k.

113
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,270
And they're telling us k is a constant.

114
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,820
And x is less than,or equal to, 100.

115
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,400
Fair enough.

116
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,070
If 20 units were produced yesterday for a total cost of $640,

117
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,230
what is the value of k? So 20 units.

118
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,340
So they're essentially saying that c of 20,

119
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,420
the cost of producing 20 units,is equal to $640.

120
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,440
So we can just use this information to now solve for k.

121
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,250
So c of 20 is going to be equal--

122
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:36,980
put in 20 to this equation-- so it's 600 times 20 minus 200.

123
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,850
All of that over 20, right?

124
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:45,200
C of 20, right? All of that over 20. Plus k.

125
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,150
I can't forget the plus k-- plus k is equal to--

126
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,700
we know that equals to 640, right?

127
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,610
And what is this equal to?

128
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,090
Well, we actually don't even have to multiply it, right?

129
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,060
Because this is 600 times 20. And what's 200?

130
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,920
200 is 10 times 20, right?

131
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,570
So you can divide the top and the bottom by 20.

132
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,810
So you have 20, 20, 20.

133
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,590
So you're just left with 600.

134
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,080
I mean, you could multiply it out

135
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,450
if you don't understand what I just did.

136
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:20,290
But you get 600 minus 10 plus k is equal to 640.

137
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,750
So you get 590 plus k is equal to 640.

138
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,850
Subtract 590 from both sides. You get k is equal to 50.

139
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,200
And that is choice B.

140
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,570
So you really just have to

141
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,210
substitute the x into our cost function.

142
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,200
And then set that equal to $640.

143
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,380
And you've solved for k.

144
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,540
Problem 14.

145
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,110
For how many ordered pairs of positive integers x, y

146
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:11,250
is 2x plus 3y less than 6?

147
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,660
So these are positive integers, right?

148
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,270
We could figure them out.

149
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,850
The 0, we can't use 0.

150
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:28,250
So if x is 1, what can y equal?

151
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:33,120
So then we have 2 plus 3y is less than 6.

152
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,620
This is a case of x is equal to 1.

153
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,340
So then we'd have 3y is less than 4.

154
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,290
So we'd have y would have to be less than 4/3.

155
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,540
So the only situation where y is less than 4/3

156
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,780
is y would have to be 1, right?

157
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,870
Because that's the only positive integer less than 4/3.

158
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,730
If x is 2, then we have 4 plus 3y, right?

159
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,220
2 times 2 is less than 6.

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,280
And so you have 3y is less than 2. y is less than 2/3.

161
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, I don't see any positive integers

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,070
that are less than 2/3.

163
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,240
So x can't even be equal to 2, right?

164
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,350
So neither of these numbers can get any bigger than 1 or 1.

165
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,680
So there's only 1 ordered pair of positive integers that--

166
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,510
positive integers, and that's the trick--

167
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,000
that satisfy this equation, 1 and 1.

168
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,370
And we know, because immediately,

169
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,890
when we just raise one of them above 2,

170
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,900
we get above 6, no matter what.

171
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,200
We can't find a positive integer that satisfies it.

172
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,430
So that's it. It's just choice A. Not too bad.

173
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,460
And I will see you in the next video.
