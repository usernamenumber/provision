1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
   

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,320
In all of the double
integrals we've done so

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,820
far, the boundaries on
x and y were fixed.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,490
Now we'll see what happens
when the boundaries on

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,690
x and y are variables.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,580
So let's say I have the same
surface, and I'm not going to

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,910
draw it the way it looks, I'll
just kind of draw

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,580
it figuratively.

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,310
But the problem we're actually
going to do is z, and this is

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,820
the exact same one we've
been doing all along.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,900
The point of here isn't to show
you how to integrate, the point

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,020
of here is to show you how
to visualize and think

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,100
about these problems.

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,430
And frankly, in double integral
problems the hardest part is

15
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,690
figuring out the boundaries.

16
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,560
Once you do that, the
integration is pretty

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,130
straightforward.

18
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,260
It's really not any harder then
single variable integration.

19
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,130
So let's say that's our
surface: z is equal

20
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,990
to xy squared.

21
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,150
Let me draw the axes again.

22
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,140
So that's my x-axis.

23
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,950
That's my z-axis.

24
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,310
That's my y-axis.

25
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,155
   

26
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:02,350
x, y, and z.

27
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,290
And you saw what this graph
looked like several videos ago.

28
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,340
I took out the whole grapher
and we rotated and things.

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,190
I'm not going to draw the graph
the way it looks; I'm just

30
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,020
going to brought fairly
abstractly as just an

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,140
abstract surface.

32
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,210
Because the point here it's
really to figure out the

33
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,420
boundaries of integration.

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,033
Before I actually even draw
the surface, I'm going

35
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:21,690
to draw the boundary.

36
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,630
The first time we did this
problem we said, OK, x goes

37
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,600
from 0 to 2, y goes from 0 to
1, and then we figured out the

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,240
volume above that
bounded domain.

39
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,920
Now let's do something else.

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,785
Let's say that x
goes from 0 to 1.

41
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:41,740
   

42
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:51,590
And let's say that the volume
that we want to figure out

43
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,920
under the surface, it's not
from a fixed y to

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,370
an upper-bound y.

45
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,170
I'll show you: it's
actually a curve.

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,340
So this is all on the xy plane,
everything I'm drawing here.

47
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,920
And this curve, we could view
it two ways: we could say y is

48
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,450
a function of x, y is
equal to x squared.

49
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,380
Or we could write is equal
to square root of y.

50
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,480
We don't have to write plus or
minus or anything like that

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,880
because we're in the
first quadrant.

52
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,150
So this is the area
above which we want to

53
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,010
figure out the volume.

54
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,830
   

55
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,070
Let me, yeah, it doesn't hurt
to color it in just so we

56
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,070
can really hone in on
what we care about.

57
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,170
So that's the area
above which we want to

58
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,490
figure out the volume.

59
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,010
You could kind of say,
that's our bounded domain.

60
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,520
And so x goes from 0 to
1, and then this point

61
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,190
is going to be what?

62
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,260
That point's going to
be 1 comma 1, right?

63
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,210
1 is equal to 1 squared, 1 is
equal to the square root of 1.

64
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,130
So this point is
y is equal to 1.

65
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,480
   

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,290
And then I'm not going to
draw this surface exactly.

67
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,530
I'm just trying to give you a
sense of what the volume of

68
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,700
the figure we're trying
to calculate is.

69
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,210
If this is just some arbitrary
surface-- let me do it in a

70
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,910
different color --so
this is the top.

71
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,770
This line is going vertical
in the z-direction.

72
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,640
   

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,340
Actually, I could draw it like
this, like it's a curve.

74
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,865
And then this curve back here
is going to be like a wall.

75
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:33,090
   

76
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,460
And maybe I'll paint this side
of the wall just so you can see

77
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,270
what it kind of looks like.

78
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,800
Trying my best.

79
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,960
Think you get an idea.

80
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,890
Let me make it a little darker;
this is actually more of an

81
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,220
exercise in art than in
math, in many ways.

82
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,090
You get the idea.

83
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,460
And then the boundary
here is like this.

84
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,260
And this top isn't flat,
you know, it could

85
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,890
be curved surface.

86
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,420
I do a little like that,
but it's a curved surface.

87
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,340
And we know in the example
we're about to do that the

88
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,770
surface right here is z
is equal to x squared.

89
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,430
So we want to figure out
the volume under this.

90
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,400
So how do we do it?

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,840
Well, let's think about it.

92
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,790
We could actually use the
intuition that I just gave you.

93
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,030
We're essentially just going to
take a da, which is a little

94
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:31,440
small square down here, and
that little area, that's the

95
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,490
same thing as the dx-- let me
use a darker color --as a dx

96
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,320
times a dy, and then we just
have to multiply it times f of

97
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,480
xy, which is this, for
each area, and then

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,110
some them all up.

99
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,610
And then we could take a sum
in the x-direction first

100
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,540
or the y-direction first.

101
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,440
Now before doing that, just
to make sure that you have

102
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,480
the intuition because the
boundaries are the hard part,

103
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,270
let me just draw our xy plane.

104
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,860
So let me rotate
it up like that.

105
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,610
I'm just going to
draw our xy plane.

106
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,020
Because that's what matters.

107
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,790
Because the hard part here
is just figuring out our

108
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,745
bounds of integration.

109
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:14,160
   

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
So the curve is just y is
equal to x squared, look

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,730
something like that.

112
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,400
This is the point
y is equal to 1.

113
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
This is y-axis, this is
the x-axis, this is the

114
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,050
point x is equal to 1.

115
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,720
   

116
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,780
That's not an x, that's a 1.

117
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,070
This is the x.

118
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,770
Anyway, so we want to figure
out, how do we sum up this dx

119
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,100
times dy, or this da,
along this domain?

120
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,760
So let's draw it.

121
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,590
Let's visually draw it and it
doesn't hurt to do this when

122
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,670
you actually have to do
the problem because this

123
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,200
frankly is the hard part.

124
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,300
A lot of calculus teachers will
just have you set up the

125
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,670
integral and then say, OK,
well the rest is easy.

126
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,360
Or the rest is Calc 1.

127
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,810
OK, so this area, this area
here is the same thing

128
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,540
as this area here.

129
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,730
So its base is dx and
its height is dy.

130
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,020
And then you could imagine
that we're looking at

131
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,320
this thing from above.

132
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,430
So the surface is up here some
place and we're looking

133
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,260
straight down on it, and so
this is just this area.

134
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,580
So let's say we wanted to
take the integral with

135
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,850
respect to x first.

136
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:28,250
So we want to sum up, so if we
want the volume above this

137
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,270
column, first of all, is this
area times dx, dy, right?

138
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,470
So let's write the volume
above that column.

139
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,700
It's going to be the value of
the function, the height at

140
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:48,830
that point, which is xy
squared times dx, dy.

141
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,360
   

142
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,170
This expression gives us the
volume above this area, or

143
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,540
this column right here.

144
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,730
And let's say we want the sum
in the x direction first.

145
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,980
So we want to sum that dx,
sum one here, sum here,

146
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,290
et cetera, et cetera.

147
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,910
So we're going to sum
in the x-direction.

148
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,540
So my question to you
is, what is our lower

149
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,330
bound of integration?

150
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:15,170
   

151
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,620
Well, we're kind of holding
our y constant, right?

152
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,700
And so if we go to the left, if
we go lower and lower x's we

153
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,040
kind of bump into
the curve here.

154
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,600
So the lower bound
of integration is

155
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,530
actually the curve.

156
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,780
And what is this curve
if we were to write x

157
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,040
is a function of y?

158
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,260
This curve is y is equal to
x squared, or x is equal

159
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,230
to the square root of y.

160
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,320
So if we're integrating with
respect to x for a fixed y

161
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,130
right here-- we're integrating
in the horizontal direction

162
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,010
first --our lower bound is x is
equal to the square root of y.

163
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,880
   

164
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,550
That's interesting.

165
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,140
I think it's the first time
you've probably seen a

166
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,420
variable bound integral.

167
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,510
But it makes sense because for
this row that we're adding up

168
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,210
right here, the upper
bound is easy.

169
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,330
The upper bound is
x is equal to 1.

170
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,860
The upper bound is x is equal
to 1, but the lower bound is

171
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,810
x is equal to the
square root of y.

172
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,220
Because you go back like,
oh, I bump into the curve.

173
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,800
And what's the curve?

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,760
Well the curve is x is equal to
the square root of y because we

175
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,720
don't know which y we picked.

176
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,210
Fair enough.

177
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,320
So once we've figured out the
volume-- so that'll give us the

178
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,470
volume above this rectangle
right here --and then we

179
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,510
want to add up the dy's.

180
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,020
   

181
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,030
And remember, there's a
whole volume above what

182
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,330
I'm drawing right here.

183
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,370
I'm just drawing this
part in the xy plane.

184
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,590
So what we've done just now,
this expression, as it's

185
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,840
written right now, figures
out the volume above

186
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,520
that rectangle.

187
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,300
Now if we want to figure out
the entire volume of the solid,

188
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,485
we integrate along the y-axis.

189
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:53,710
Or we add up all the dy's.

190
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,870
This was a dy right
here, not a dx.

191
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,780
My dx's and dy's
look too similar.

192
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,860
So now what is the lower bound
on the y-axis if I'm summing

193
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,560
up these rectangles?

194
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,180
   

195
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,270
Well, the lower bound
is y is equal to 0.

196
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,580
So we're going to go from
y is equal to 0 to what--

197
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,910
what is the upper bound?

198
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,630
--to y is equal to 1.

199
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,400
And there you have it.

200
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,590
Let me rewrite that integral.

201
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,250
So the double integral is going
to be from x is equal to square

202
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:35,810
root of y to x is equal to
1, xy squared, dx, dy.

203
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:43,090
And then the y bound, y
goes from 0 to y to 1.

204
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,580
I've just realized
I've run out of time.

205
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,020
In the next video we'll
evaluate this, and then we'll

206
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,155
do it in the other order.

207
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,770
See you soon.

208
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,400
