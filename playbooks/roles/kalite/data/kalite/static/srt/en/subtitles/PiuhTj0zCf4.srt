1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,420
Let's say I've got some linear
transformation T that is a

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,970
mapping from Rn to Rn.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,570
So if this is its domain, which
is just Rn, then its

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,670
codomain is also Rn.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,170
   

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,400
If you give me some vector in
our domain, let's call that

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,650
vector x, then T will map it
to some other member of Rn,

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,770
which is also the codomain.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,790
So it'll map it over here.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,690
We could call that the mapping
of T, or the mapping

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,700
of x, or T of x.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,850
Since T is a linear
transformation, we know that

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,740
the mapping of x to its codomain
is equivalent to x

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,980
being multiplied by
some matrix A.

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,470
So we know that this thing right
here is equal to some

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,600
matrix A times x.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,880
You've seen all of this
multiple, multiple times.

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,720
Just to make sure we understand
the wording

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,960
properly, we said we've used
the word that A is the-- we

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,750
could either call it the matrix
for T, or let's say

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:21,710
it's the transformation
matrix for T.

23
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,950
Now, in the last couple of
videos, we've learned that the

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,860
same vector can be represented
in different ways.

25
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,810
It can be represented in
different coordinate systems.

26
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,180
When I just write the vector x
like that, we just assume that

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,980
it's being represented in
standard coordinates, or it's

28
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,690
being represented with respect
to the standard basis.

29
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,050
So let's be a little bit
more particular.

30
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:50,530
This A is the transformation
for T only when x is

31
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,180
represented in standard
coordinates, or only when x is

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,930
written in coordinates with
respect to the standard basis.

33
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,875
So let me write a little
qualifier here.

34
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,820
   

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:13,590
A is the transformation matrix
for T with respect to the

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,840
standard basis.

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,980
   

38
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,120
I never wrote this
blue part before.

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,270
I never even said this blue part
before, because the only

40
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,560
coordinate system we were
dealing with was the standard

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,000
coordinate system or the
coordinates with respect to

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,950
the standard basis.

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,580
But now we know that there are
multiple coordinate systems.

44
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,810
There are multiple ways to
represent this vector.

45
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,690
There are multiple ways to
represent that vector, because

46
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,060
Rn has multiple spanning
bases.

47
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,010
There are multiple bases that
can represent Rn, and each of

48
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,630
those bases can generate a
coordinate system where you

49
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,450
can represent any vector in Rn
with coordinates with respect

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,740
to any of those bases.

51
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,470
So that last part I said was a
bit of a mouthful, so let me

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,880
make it a little bit
more concrete.

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,980
Let's say that I have some basis
B that's made up of n--

54
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,840
it has to be linearly
independent.

55
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,010
That's the definition of a
basis-- of n vectors v1, v2,

56
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,480
all the way to vn.

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,150
Now, these are n linearly
independent vectors.

58
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,480
Each of these are
members of Rn.

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:35,030
So B is a basis for Rn, which is
just another way of saying

60
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,060
that all of these vectors are
linearly independent and any

61
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,690
vector in Rn can be represented
as a linear

62
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,440
combination of these guys, which
is another way of saying

63
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,220
that any vector in Rn can be
represented with coordinates

64
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,410
with respect to this
basis right there.

65
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,580
So the same vector x,
I'm going to put

66
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,770
the same dot here.

67
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,630
When we represent it in standard
coordinates, it's

68
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,730
just going to be that right
there, that vector x.

69
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,540
But what if we want to represent
it in coordinates

70
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,090
with respect to this
new basis?

71
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,990
Well, then that same vector
x will look like this.

72
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,240
We would denote it by this.

73
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,660
The same vector can be
represented with respect to

74
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,220
this basis.

75
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,519
This could be some set
of coordinates.

76
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,270
This would be some other set of
coordinates, but it's still

77
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,210
representing the same basis.

78
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,720
Likewise, this vector right
here, that vector right there,

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,980
is also in Rn.

80
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,300
So it can be represented by
some linear combination of

81
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,100
these guys, or you can represent
it with coordinates

82
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,920
with respect to this basis.

83
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,940
So that same point right there,
I could represent it.

84
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,680
So that point is this.

85
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,700
But I could represent it with
coordinates with respect to my

86
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,380
basis just like that.

87
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,390
So this is an interesting
question.

88
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,210
This should maybe bring
an interesting

89
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,140
question into your brain.

90
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,270
If I start off with something
that's in standard

91
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,360
coordinates, and I apply the
transformation T-- that's like

92
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,010
applying this matrix A to it or
multiplying that thing in

93
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,780
standard coordinates times the
matrix A-- I then get the

94
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,770
mapping of T in standard
coordinates.

95
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,300
Now, what if I start off with
that thing in nonstandard

96
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,610
coordinates if I have
coordinates with respect to

97
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,590
this other basis here?

98
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,365
Well, T should still
map it to this guy.

99
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:27,380
   

100
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,520
The transformation, no matter
what, should always map from

101
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,700
that dot to that dot.

102
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,640
It shouldn't care what
your coordinates are.

103
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,750
So T should still map to
that same exact point.

104
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,940
T should still be a linear
transformation.

105
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,850
It can map from x to T of x, but
that's the same thing as

106
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,940
mapping from this kind of way
of labeling x to this way of

107
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,100
labeling x.

108
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:58,720
So we could say maybe this guy
right here could be some other

109
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,285
matrix times this
guy over here.

110
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:02,810
So let me write this
over here.

111
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:08,480
   

112
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,460
These are just different
coordinate systems. I

113
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,650
shouldn't just even say maybe.

114
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,146
This guy should be able
to be represented.

115
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:20,830
So if I represent the mapping
of x in our codomain in

116
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,300
coordinates with respect to B--
so that's what that guy is

117
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,980
right there-- so if I want to
represent that dot with this

118
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,120
other coordinate system,
coordinates with respect to

119
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,970
this basis, it should be
equal to the product

120
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,170
of some other matrix.

121
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,650
Let me call that
other matrix D.

122
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:44,740
Some other matrix D times this
representation of x times the

123
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,230
coordinates of x with respect
to my alternate nonstandard

124
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,400
coordinate system.

125
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,290
I should be able to find some
matrix D that does this.

126
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:02,140
Then we would say that D is the

127
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:12,270
transformation matrix for T.

128
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,120
A assumes that you have x in
terms of standard coordinates.

129
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,720
Now D assumes that you have x in
coordinates with respect to

130
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:35,440
this basis, so with respect
to the basis B.

131
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,550
There's no reason why we
shouldn't be able to do this.

132
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,090
These things are just different
ways of representing

133
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,910
the exact same vector,
the exact same

134
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,860
dot in our sets here.

135
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,820
So if I represent it one way,
the standard way, I multiply

136
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,180
by A, and I get Ax.

137
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,760
If I represent it in nonstandard
coordinates, I

138
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,970
should be able to multiply it
by some other matrix and get

139
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,500
another nonstandard coordinate
representation of what

140
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,270
it gets mapped to.

141
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,420
So let's see if we can find
some relation between

142
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,510
D and between A.

143
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,200
So we learned a couple of videos
ago that there's a

144
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,900
change of basis matrix that we
can generate from this basis.

145
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,420
It's pretty easy to generate.

146
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,690
The change of basis matrix is
just a matrix whose columns

147
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,865
are these basis vectors, so
v1, v2-- I shouldn't put a

148
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:28,160
comma there.

149
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,840
These are just the columns--
v2 all the way to vn.

150
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,530
This is an n-by-n matrix.

151
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,220
Each of these guys are members
of Rn and we have n of them.

152
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,760
This is an n-by-n matrix where
all of the columns are

153
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,570
linearly independent, so we
know that C is invertible.

154
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,010
These are column vectors
right here.

155
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,650
So we know that C
is invertible.

156
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,450
   

157
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:59,040
We learned in the last two or
three videos that if we have

158
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,860
some vector x, and it's being
represented by coordinates

159
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,600
with respect to our basis B, we
can just multiply that by

160
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,950
C, and we'll get our vector x.

161
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,350
This essentially will tell us
the linear combination of

162
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,160
these guys that'll get us x.

163
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,980
Since C is invertible, we also
saw that if we have the

164
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,380
standard format for x, or the
standard coordinates for x, we

165
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,970
can multiply that
by C inverse.

166
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:43,020
That will get us the coordinates
for x with respect

167
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,080
to the basis B.

168
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,310
These two things, if you just
multiply both sides of this

169
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,460
equation-- let me do it in a
different color-- if you just

170
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,310
multiply both sides of this
equation by C inverse on the

171
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,290
left-hand side, you're
going to get this

172
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,310
equation right there.

173
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,450
Now given that, let's
see if we can find

174
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,170
some type of relation.

175
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,740
Let's see what D times
xB is equal to.

176
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,420
So let's say if we take D times
xB, so this thing right

177
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:22,740
here should be equal to D times
the representation or

178
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,130
the coordinates of x with
respect to the basis B.

179
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,510
That's what we're claiming.

180
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,550
We're saying that this guy
is equal to D times the

181
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,200
representation of x with respect
to the coordinates

182
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,440
with respect to the basis B.

183
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,060
Let me write all of this down.

184
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,940
I'll do it right here, because I
think it's nice to have this

185
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,660
graphic up here.

186
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:52,400
So we can say that D times
xB is equal to

187
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,660
this thing right here.

188
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,960
It's the same thing as the
transformation of x

189
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,990
represented in coordinates with
respect to B, or in these

190
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,230
nonstandard coordinates.

191
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,890
So it's equal to the
transformation of x

192
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,420
represented in this coordinate
system, represented in

193
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,460
coordinates with respect to B.

194
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,190
We see that right there.

195
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,370
But what is the transformation
of x?

196
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,710
   

197
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,950
That's the same thing
as A times x.

198
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,790
That's kind of the standard
transformation if x was

199
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,050
represented in standard
coordinates.

200
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,670
So this is equal to x in
standard coordinates

201
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,900
times the matrix A.

202
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,740
Then that will get us to this
dot in standard coordinates,

203
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,830
but then we want to convert
it to these nonstandard

204
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,970
coordinates just like that.

205
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:49,050
Now, if we have this, how can
we just figure out what the

206
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,550
vector Ax should look like?

207
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,330
What this vector should
look like?

208
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,990
Well, we can look at this
equation right here.

209
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,570
We have this.

210
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,920
This is the same
thing as this.

211
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,560
   

212
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,150
Actually.

213
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,010
we want to go the other way.

214
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,670
We have this.

215
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,180
We have that right there.

216
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,090
That's this right there.

217
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,820
We want to get just this dot
represented in regular

218
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,680
standard coordinates.

219
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,310
So what do we do?

220
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,740
We multiply it by C.

221
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,330
Let me write it this way.

222
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,350
If we multiply both sides
of this equation times

223
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,130
C, what do we get?

224
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,785
We get this right here.

225
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:31,320
   

226
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,780
Actually, no.

227
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,250
I was looking at the right
equation the first time.

228
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,490
We have this right here, which
is the same-- first intuition

229
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,660
is always right.

230
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,100
We have this, which is the same
thing as this right here.

231
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,510
So this can be rewritten.

232
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,690
This thing can be rewritten
as C inverse-- we

233
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,690
don't have an x here.

234
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:57,690
We have an Ax here, so
C inverse times Ax.

235
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:03,130
The vector Ax represented in
these nonstandard coordinates

236
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,930
is the same thing as multiplying
the inverse of our

237
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,835
change of basis matrix
times the vector Ax.

238
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:15,510
If I have my vector Ax and I
multiply it times the inverse

239
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,160
of the change of basis matrix,
I will then have a

240
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,460
representation of the vector
Ax in my nonstandard basis.

241
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,500
Now, what is the vector
x equal to?

242
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,300
   

243
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,870
Well, the vector x is equal to
our change of basis matrix

244
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,230
times x represented in these
nonstandard coordinates.

245
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,340
So this is going to be equal to
C inverse A times x. x is

246
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,550
just the same thing as C.

247
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:54,200
x is just C times our
nonstandard coordinates for x,

248
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,210
just like that.

249
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,360
Let me summarize it, just
because I waffled a little bit

250
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,736
on this point right there
just because I got

251
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:01,080
a little bit confused.

252
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,710
If I start off with the
nonstandard representation of

253
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,710
x, or x in coordinates
with respect to B, I

254
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,000
multiply them times D.

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,490
So if I start with this, I
multiply them times D, I get

256
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,580
to that point right there.

257
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,600
So this right there is
the same thing as

258
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,000
this point right there.

259
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,500
That point right there should
be the nonstandard

260
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,070
representation of the
transformation of x, or the

261
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,310
coordinates of the
transformation of x with

262
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,730
respect to B.

263
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,010
Now, the transformation of
x, if x is in standard

264
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,080
coordinates, is just
A times x.

265
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,830
So this is just A times x.

266
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,650
But I want to represent it in
these nonstandard coordinates.

267
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:47,750
Now, A times x in nonstandard
coordinates is the same thing

268
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,290
as C inverse times A times x, if
you think this is the same

269
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,860
thing as this.

270
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,730
So if you have this and you
want to represent it in

271
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,396
nonstandard coordinates, you
multiply it by C inverse, so

272
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:01,360
then you'll get that
representation in nonstandard

273
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,530
coordinates.

274
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:07,150
Then finally, we say look, x is
the same thing as C times

275
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,330
the nonstandard coordinate
representation of x.

276
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,840
So we can replace x with
that right there.

277
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:22,530
So the big takeaway here is that
D times the coordinates

278
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:30,280
of x with respect to the basis
B is equal to C inverse A

279
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:37,300
times C times the coordinates
of x with respect

280
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,550
to the basis B.

281
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,060
   

282
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,170
So D must be equal
to C inverse AC.

283
00:15:47,170 --> 00:16:07,240
So if D is the transformation
matrix for T with respect to

284
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:26,970
the basis B-- and let me write
here-- and C is the change of

285
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:41,830
basis matrix for B-- let me
write that down, might as well

286
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:47,030
because this is our big
takeaway-- and A is the

287
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:55,800
transformation-- I'll write it
in shorthand-- matrix for T

288
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:09,910
with respect to the standard
basis, then we can say-- this

289
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,240
is the big takeaway-- that D,
our matrix D, is equal to C

290
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,750
inverse times A times C.

291
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,099
That's our big takeaway from
this video, which is really

292
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,089
interesting.

293
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,920
I don't want you to
lose this point.

294
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,170
We now understand that A is
just for a certain set of

295
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:31,670
coordinates.

296
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,670
But there's arbitrary different
bases that we can

297
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,340
use to represent Rn, so we can
have different matrices that

298
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,580
represent the linear
transformation under different

299
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,900
coordinate systems. If we want
to figure out those different

300
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,160
matrices for different
coordinate systems, we can

301
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,790
essentially just construct the
change of basis matrix for the

302
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,820
coordinate system we care about,
and then generate our

303
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,100
new transformation matrix with
respect to the new basis by

304
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,700
just applying this result.
