1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's try to evaluate the indefinite integral 1 over the square root of 1 minus x^2 dx.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you might try something like u-substitution, but you'll find out that it doesn't get you very far with this integral,

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so instead we will do something called Trig Substitution.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the whole idea behind trigonometric substitution is to substitute for x so that with a trig function,
