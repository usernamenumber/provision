00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:06,334
Dr. Steven Zucker: We're in the GemÃ¤ldegalerie in Berlin

3
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:09,220
looking at a really spectacular panel painting by Giotto

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,499
this is The Entombment of Mary

5
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:15,006
--and it shows the Virgin Mary tenderly being lowered into her tomb

6
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:24,171
but it also simultaneously shows her spirit rendered as an infant being cradled by Christ in heaven

7
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:28,291
Dr. Harris: It was made for the Church of Ognissanti--or All Saints Church--in Florence

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:32,673
--and it's certainly one of the jewels of their collection

9
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:35,949
Dr. Zucker: It's a wonderful representation of the qualities that made Giotto

10
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,740
such an important artist in the early 14th century

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,187
Dr. Harris: In the late 1200s--the traditional that Giotto was coming out of is the Byzantine tradition

12
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:50,067
--where the figures are elongated--where there is an emphasis of gold and patterning

13
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,688
--where the figures seem very distant from us

14
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:57,605
and there's no real interest in their bodies as existing three-dimensionally in space

15
00:00:57,605 --> 00:01:00,016
--but that's exactly what Giotto gives us

16
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:04,088
Dr. Zucker: The figures have a sense of volume--of mass--of solidity--of gravity

17
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:07,572
--but more than that--you've got a kind of psychological intensity

18
00:01:07,572 --> 00:01:12,804
and interaction that makes these figures seem as if they are autonomous in the world

19
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:17,220
Dr. Harris: So let's take for example--St. Peter--whose engrossed in reading

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,919
and if we look at the robe that he wears we can that Giotto has moved from light to dark

21
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:25,719
to indicate the folds of the drapery

22
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:29,197
and a sense of the figure being round and three-dimensional

23
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:32,738
Dr. Zucker: You can see the way in which the figure's elbow is pressing into his waist

24
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:35,738
--gathering that cloth--creating those folds

25
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:39,163
--and there is really a sense then of the reality of that moment

26
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:42,803
--something we recognize as our own elbows have pressed into our sides

27
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:46,516
Dr. Harris: Look at how gently she's being lowered into the tomb

28
00:01:46,516 --> 00:01:51,971
--and the look on the face of the apostle who lowers her body

29
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:54,466
--looking into her eyes so lovingly

30
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:57,548
Dr. Zucker: The intimacy between them can be seen again

31
00:01:57,548 --> 00:02:02,014
between the spirit of Mary in the body of the child and Christ

32
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:05,264
--their faces are close--they look at each other

33
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:07,413
Dr. Harris: And it's also a kind of inversion

34
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:10,231
of the image of Mary and Christ that we usually see

35
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,735
where Mary is shown holding Christ as a child

36
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:18,098
Dr. Zucker: And look at the way that the representation of Mary's soul--the infant

37
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:21,605
--has it's light drapery swirled around it

38
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:25,034
--it's just a beautiful kind of tender rendering by the artist

39
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,353
--just to the right of Christ you see a figure bending over slightly

40
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:33,600
--that's St. Andrew whose sprinkling holy water on the dead body of Christ's mother

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,774
--but perhaps my favorite figure is just to the right of that

42
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:41,334
--you can see in back of the angels who are holding tall candles

43
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:45,498
--there's a figure in a kind of yellow white gold--his cheeks are puffed out

44
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,219
--and if you look closely--in his right hand he's holding high a censer

45
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:53,581
--that is he is distributing incense and it seems as if he is trying to blow it towards Mary

46
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:57,022
Dr. Harris: Just to the right another angel has its mouth open

47
00:02:57,022 --> 00:03:03,008
--as though she is speaking and two angels just to the right of that seem to be engaged in conversation

48
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:07,038
--so while this image is very formal and hierarchical

49
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:10,731
--with Christ in the center--larger than all the figures

50
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:13,937
--it's at the same time informal and natural

51
00:03:13,937 --> 00:03:16,752
Dr. Zucker: That sense of the natural comes across so well

52
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:19,506
in the conversation between those angels

53
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:22,783
--the angel who stands in front--look at the way in which

54
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:26,034
the thumbs of that angel are hooked into belt--into its pockets

55
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:29,822
--there is this sort of wonderful sense of total informality there

56
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:32,649
Dr. Harris: In fact that angel also looks like she is about to speak

57
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:37,133
Dr. Zucker: This is a painting about Mary leaving the physical realm and becoming spirital

58
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,750
--but it's this kind of intimacy--this kind of detail of individual actions

59
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,954
through which Giotto creates this fabulous sense of reality

60
00:03:45,954 --> 00:04:01,939
