1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:04,019
"Per cent" literally means per hundred".

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,246
That's where the word comes from.

3
00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:10,143
"Cent" from cents or century or any of those words mean one hundred.

4
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:14,216
So someone tells you 7 per cent,

5
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:16,428
and I'm separating the words so it makes a little more sense.

6
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:21,929
He is always saying 7 per 100. This is the same thing as 7 per 100.

7
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:27,341
Which is the same thing as a fraction as 7 / 100.

8
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:30,545
With that out of the way let see if we can write.

9
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:36,208
If we can write 0.601 as a... as a percentage.

10
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:40,431
We essentially want to write it as something over 100.

11
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,589
So you could view it as

12
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:44,613
- I just rewrite this part right over here -

13
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:50,247
you could write it as 0.601 over 1. This is obviously the same quantity

14
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:53,055
You divide anything by 1 you should get that same anything.

15
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:59,747
I'm gonna multiply it by... multiply it by 100 over 100.

16
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:01,657
Obviously this won't change the value.

17
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:03,074
This is just 1 here.

18
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:05,081
But what this does it'll give us a fraction

19
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,531
on term with the denominator being a 100.

20
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:10,891
So the denominator if I multiply... if I multiply

21
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,964
these two characters right over here in the denominator,

22
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:16,122
The denominator of our product is going to be 100.

23
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:20,749
If I multiply 0.601 times 100 what am I going to get?

24
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:24,562
Well every time I'm multiplied by a multiple of 10

25
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:26,392
or every time I multiply by 10

26
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:28,674
I'm gonna shift the decimal over to the right ones.

27
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:32,042
So if I'm multiplied by 10 I get 6.01

28
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:35,174
and if I multiply by 10 again or I multiply by 100,

29
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:37,313
I'm going to get 60.1

30
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:44,329
So 0 point 6 0 1 times a hundred is 60.1

31
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:45,375
Let me rewrite that again.

32
00:01:45,745 --> 00:01:48,363
If were to write... if I were to write,

33
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:52,548
0.601 and I wanna multiply it by 100.

34
00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:55,027
Shift the decimal ones, I multiply by 10

35
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:56,920
if I multiply by 10 again,

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,678
or essentially multiply by 100,

37
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:00,896
I get 60.1

38
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:03,703
So this is times 10, this is times 10 again,

39
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:05,625
I was essentially multiplied by 100.

40
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,645
But now we have it in the form we like,

41
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:09,856
we have 60.1 over 100.

42
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:11,244
Or you can rewrite this,

43
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:18,508
this is the same this as 60.1 per 100... per 100,

44
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:24,059
which is the same thing as 60.1 per cent.

45
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:26,646
And that we obviously want to write then

46
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,695
60.1 percent as one word.

47
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:31,993
Or 60.1 and we just use the symbol,

48
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:34,651
60.1%, we are done.
