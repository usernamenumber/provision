1
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:05,828
This right here is a picture of an Airbus A380 aircraft,

2
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:07,129
and I was curious

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:11,262
How long would it take this aircraft to take-off?

4
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:18,135
And I looked up its take-off velocity,

5
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:23,986
and the specs I got were 280 km/h.

6
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:25,426
And to make this a velocity,

7
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,423
we have to specify a direction as well,

8
00:00:27,423 --> 00:00:28,909
not just a magnitude.

9
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:31,974
So the direction is in the direction of the runway.

10
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:34,807
So that would be the positive direction.

11
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:37,314
So when we're talking about acceleration,

12
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:40,101
we're going to assume it's in this direction,

13
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:43,000
the direction of going down the runway.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,977
And I also looked up its specs,

15
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:46,835
and this I'm simplifying a little bit,

16
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,414
because it's not going to have a purely

17
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:49,528
constant acceleration.

18
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:50,226
But let's just say:

19
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:51,757
from the moment that the pilot says,

20
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:54,172
"We're taking off" to when it actually takes off,

21
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:55,890
it has a constant acceleration.

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,652
Its engines are able to provide a constant acceleration.

23
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:09,888
Acceleration of 1.0 m/s per second

24
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:11,480
So after every second,

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,585
it can go one m/s faster

26
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:14,671
than it was going

27
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:16,170
at the beginning of that second.

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,764
Or, another way to write this is

29
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:27,032
1.0 m/s per second,

30
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:28,631
which can also be written as:

31
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:31,248
1.0 m/s^2

32
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:33,226
I find this a little bit more intuitive,

33
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,133
a little bit neater to write.

34
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:36,340
So let's figure this out.

35
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,315
So the first thing

36
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:38,787
that we're trying to answer is:

37
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:47,303
How long does take-off last?

38
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:50,412
That is the question we will try to answer.

39
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:51,185
And to answer this,

40
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:52,547
at least my brain,

41
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,406
wants to at least get the units right.

42
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,072
So over here,

43
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,047
we have our acceleration

44
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,059
in terms of meters and seconds,

45
00:01:58,059 --> 00:01:59,327
or seconds squared.

46
00:01:59,327 --> 00:01:59,886
And over here,

47
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,813
we have our take-off velocity

48
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:04,333
in terms of kilometers and hours.

49
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,179
So let's just convert

50
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:07,254
this take-off velocity into m/s,

51
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:08,244
and then it might simplify

52
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:10,473
answering this question.

53
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:15,056
So if we have 280 km/h,

54
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:18,200
how do we convert that to m/s?

55
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,589
So let's convert it to km/s first.

56
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:24,019
So we want to get rid of this 'hour'.

57
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,381
And the best way to do that:

58
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,048
if we have an 'hour'

59
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:27,130
in the denominator,

60
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,477
we want an 'hour' in the numerator,

61
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:31,650
and we want a 'second' in the denominator.

62
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,947
And so, what do we multiply this by?

63
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:35,815
Or what do we put in front of

64
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:37,115
the 'hours' and 'seconds'?

65
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:41,309
So in 1 hour there are 3600 seconds.

66
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:42,563
60 seconds in a minute,

67
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,978
60 minutes in an hour

68
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:46,976
And so 1 of the larger unit

69
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:50,318
is equal to 3600 of the smaller unit.

70
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:52,425
And so we can multiply by that,

71
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:53,786
And if we do that,

72
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,088
The 'hours' will cancel out.

73
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,331
And we'll get 280 divided by 3600

74
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:59,128
kilometers per second.

75
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:00,400
But I want to do all my math at once,

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,579
so let's also do the conversion from

77
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,638
kilometers to meters.

78
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:05,877
So once again,

79
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:08,741
we have kilometers in the numerator,

80
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:11,133
so we want kilometers in the denominator now.

81
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,238
So it cancels out.

82
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:14,235
And we want meters in the numerator.

83
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,953
And what's the smaller unit?

84
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:18,600
It's meters, and we have 1,000 meters

85
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,969
for every 1 kilometer.

86
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:22,394
And when you multiply this out,

87
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:23,941
the kilometers are going to cancel out,

88
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:25,333
and you're going to be left with

89
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:41,530
280 times 1,000 all over 3600,

90
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,003
And the units we have left are:

91
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:52,907
meters per second.

92
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:56,010
So let's get my trusty TI-85 out

93
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,014
and actually calculate this.

94
00:03:58,014 --> 00:04:01,450
So we have 280 * 1,000,

95
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,875
which is obviously 280,000,

96
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,964
but let me just divide that by 3600.

97
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:10,894
And it gives me 77.7 repeating.

98
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:13,634
And it looks like I had 2 significant digits

99
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:15,259
in each of these original things,

100
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,069
I had 1.0 over here,

101
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:18,557
not 100% clear how many

102
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:20,272
significant digits I have over here.

103
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:22,067
Was the spec rounded

104
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,988
to the nearest 10 kilometers,

105
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:26,715
or was it exactly 280 km/h?

106
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:27,796
Just to be safe,

107
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:28,772
I'll assume that it's rounded

108
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:30,067
to the nearest 10 kilometers,

109
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,379
so we only have 2 significant digits here.

110
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,972
So we should only have 2 significant digits

111
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:34,901
in our answer,

112
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:40,625
so we're gonna round this to 78 m/s.

113
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:48,728
So this is going to be 78 m/s,

114
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:50,319
which is pretty fast!

115
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,316
For this thing to take off,

116
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:53,616
every second that goes by,

117
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,985
it has to travel 78 meters,

118
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,979
roughly 3/4 the length of a football field

119
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:01,668
in every second.

120
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,148
But that's not what we're trying to answer,

121
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:04,361
we're trying to say how long

122
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,956
will take-off last?

123
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:07,922
Well we could just do this in our head,

124
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:09,685
if you think about it.

125
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,989
The acceleration is 1 m/s per second,

126
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:13,771
which tells us:

127
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,304
after every second,

128
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:17,301
it's going 1 m/s faster.

129
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:20,273
So, if you start at a velocity of 0,

130
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:21,791
and then after 1 second,

131
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,966
it will be going 1 m/s.

132
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:23,757
After 2 seconds,

133
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,011
it will be going 2 m/s.

134
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:25,847
After 3 seconds,

135
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,318
it will be going 3 m/s.

136
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,908
So how long will it get to 78 m/s?

137
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:33,015
Well, it will take 78 seconds.

138
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,199
It'll take 78 seconds, or roughly

139
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,739
a minute and 18 seconds.

140
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:42,375
And just to verify this

141
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:44,831
with our definition of acceleration,

142
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,471
so to speak,

143
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,272
just remember acceleration,

144
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:48,373
which is a vector quantity,

145
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:48,993
and all the directions

146
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:49,845
we're talking about now

147
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:51,097
are in the direction of

148
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,395
this direction of the runway.

149
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,898
The acceleration is equal to

150
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:04,889
change in velocity over change in time.

151
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:05,971
And we're trying to solve for:

152
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:07,147
how much time does it take,

153
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:08,544
or the change in time.

154
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:09,484
So let's do that.

155
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:10,892
So let's multiply both sides by

156
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,256
change in time.

157
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:17,860
You get Δt * acceleration

158
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:19,919
is equal to

159
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,408
change in velocity.

160
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:25,600
And to solve for change in time,

161
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,745
divide both sides by the acceleration,

162
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:33,756
you get change in time.

163
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:35,320
I could go down here,

164
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,327
but I just want to use all this

165
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:37,520
real-estate I have over here.

166
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,744
I have change in time

167
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:40,150
is equal to

168
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,961
change in velocity

169
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:48,041
divided by acceleration.

170
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,159
And in this situation,

171
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,667
what is our change in velocity?

172
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,942
Well, we're starting off with the velocity,

173
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:54,953
or we're assuming we're starting off

174
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:57,733
with the velocity of 0 m/s,

175
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:01,112
and we're getting up to 78 m/s,

176
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:02,667
so our change in velocity is

177
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:08,458
the 78 m/s.

178
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,158
So this is equal,

179
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:11,112
in our situation.

180
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:14,719
78 m/s is our change in velocity.

181
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:15,955
I'm taking the final velocity,

182
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:17,301
78 m/s,

183
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:18,602
and subtracting from that

184
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:19,408
the initial velocity,

185
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:20,400
which is 0 m/s,

186
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,899
and you just get this

187
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,733
divided by the acceleration,

188
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:29,353
divided by 1 m/s per second,

189
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:31,512
or 1 m/s^2.

190
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:33,309
So the numbers part is pretty easy.

191
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:35,320
You have 78 divided by 1,

192
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,992
which is just 78,

193
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:38,199
and then the units, you have:

194
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,267
meters per second,

195
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:42,611
and then if you divide by m/s^2,

196
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:44,608
that's the same thing as multiplying by

197
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:46,499
seconds squared per meter.

198
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,225
Right?

199
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:49,890
Dividing by something is the same thing

200
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,886
as multiplying by its reciprocal,

201
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:54,246
and you can do the same thing with units.

202
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:55,336
And then we see

203
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,240
the meters cancel out,

204
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,330
and then sec^2 divided by seconds

205
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,570
you're just left with seconds.

206
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,425
So once again, we get 78 seconds.

207
00:08:04,425 --> 99:59:59,999
A little over a minute for this thing to take off.
