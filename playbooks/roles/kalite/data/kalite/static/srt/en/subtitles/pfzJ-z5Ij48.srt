1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,530
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,080
We'll now use a little bit of
what we've learned about work

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,540
and energy and the conservation
of energy and

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,240
apply it to simple machines.

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,650
And we'll learn a little bit
about mechanical advantage.

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,760
So I've drawn a simple
lever here.

8
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,830
And you've probably
been exposed to

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,890
simple levers before.

10
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,040
They're really just kind
of like a seesaw.

11
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,910
This place where the
lever pivots.

12
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,970
This is called a fulcrum.

13
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,090
Just really the pivot point.

14
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,480
And you can kind of view this
as either a seesaw or a big

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,710
plank of wood on top of a
triangle, which essentially is

16
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,760
what I've drawn.

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,750
So in this example, I have
the big plank of wood.

18
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,729
At one end I have this 10
newton weight, and I've

19
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,720
written 10 in there.

20
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,640
And what we're going to figure
out is one, how much force--

21
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,480
well, we could figure out
a couple of things.

22
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,300
How much force do I have
to apply here to

23
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,430
just keep this level?

24
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,800
Because this weight's going
to be pushing downwards.

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,370
So it would naturally
want this whole

26
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,200
lever to rotate clockwise.

27
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,540
So what I want to figure out is,
how much force do I have

28
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,860
to apply to either keep the
lever level or to actually

29
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,450
rotate this lever
counterclockwise?

30
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,040
And when I rotate the lever

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,310
counterclockwise, what's happening?

32
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,810
I'm pushing down on this
left-hand side, and I'm

33
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,490
lifting this 10 newton block.

34
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,950
So let's do a little thought
experiment and see what

35
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,200
happens after I rotate this
lever a little bit.

36
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,970
So let's say, what I've drawn
here in mauve, that's our

37
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,140
starting position.

38
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,550
And in yellow, I'm going to draw
the finishing position.

39
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,040
So the finishing position
is going to look

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,290
something like this.

41
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,560
   

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,091
I'll try my best to draw it.

43
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:36,120
The finishing position is
something like this.

44
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,890
And also, one thing I want to
figure out, that I wanted to

45
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,000
write, is let's say that the
distance, that this distance

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,610
right here, from where I'm
applying the force to the

47
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,245
fulcrum, let's say that
that distance is 2.

48
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,990
And from the fulcrum to the
weight that I'm lifting, that

49
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,020
distance is 1.

50
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,430
Let's just say that, just for
the sake of argument.

51
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,570
Let's say it's 2 meters and 1
meter, although it could be 2

52
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,340
kilometers and 1 kilometer,
we'll soon see.

53
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,300
And what I did is I pressed down
with some force, and I

54
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,960
rotated it through
an angle theta.

55
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,540
So that's theta and this
is also theta.

56
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,540
So my question to you, and
we'll have to take out a

57
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,390
little bit of our trigonometry
skills, is how much did this

58
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,060
object move up?

59
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,700
So essentially, what
was this distance?

60
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,850
What's its distance in the
vertical direction?

61
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,150
How much did it go up?

62
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,550
And also, for what distance did
I have to apply the force

63
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,070
downwards here-- so that's this
distance-- in order for

64
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,770
this weight to move up this
distance over here?

65
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,680
So let's figure out
either one.

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,700
So this distance is what?

67
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,830
Well, we have theta.

68
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,870
This is the opposite.

69
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,410
This is a 90 degree
angle, because we

70
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,060
started off at level.

71
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,780
So this is opposite.

72
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,250
And this is what?

73
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,890
This is the adjacent angle.

74
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,840
So what do we have there?

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,900
Opposite over adjacent.

76
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,920
Soh Cah Toa.

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,760
Opposite over adjacent.

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,750
Opposite over adjacent.

79
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,490
That's Toa, or tangent.

80
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:11,780
So in this situation, we know
that the tangent of theta is

81
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:19,070
equal to-- let's call
this the distance

82
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,702
that we move the weight.

83
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:21,400
soon.

84
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,480
So that equals opposite over
adjacent, the distance that we

85
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,050
moved the weight over 1.

86
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,490
And then if we go on
to this side, we

87
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,070
can do the same thing.

88
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,110
Tangent is opposite
over adjacent.

89
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,530
So let's call this the distance
of the force.

90
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,030
So here the opposite of the
distance of the force and the

91
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,240
adjacent is this 2 meters.

92
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,340
Because this is the hypotenuse
right here.

93
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,530
So we also have the tangent of
theta-- now you're using this

94
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,030
triangle-- is equal to
the opposite side.

95
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,250
The distance of the force
over 2 meters.

96
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,020
So this is interesting.

97
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,500
They're both equal to
tangent of theta.

98
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,530
We don't even have to
figure out what the

99
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,380
tangent of theta is.

100
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:11,190
We know that this quantity is
equal to this quantity.

101
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,150
And we can write it here.

102
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,250
We could write the distance of
the force, that's the distance

103
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,089
that we had to push down on
the side of the lever

104
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,460
downwards, over 2, is equal to
the distance of the weight.

105
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,070
The distance the weight traveled
upwards is equal to

106
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,350
the distance, the weight,
divided by 1.

107
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,110
Or we could say-- this
1 we can ignore.

108
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,500
Something divided
by 1 is just 1.

109
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,130
Or we could say that the
distance of the force is equal

110
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,100
to 2 times the distance
of the weight.

111
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,270
And this is interesting, because
now we can apply what

112
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,870
we just learned here to figure
out what the force was.

113
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,750
And how do I do that?

114
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,500
Well, when I'm applying a
force here, over some

115
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,950
distance, I'm putting energy
into the system.

116
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,710
I'm doing work.

117
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,260
Work is just a transfer of
energy into this machine.

118
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,100
And when I do that, that
machine is actually

119
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,270
transferring that energy
to this block.

120
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,670
It's actually doing work on the
block by lifting it up.

121
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,640
So we know the law of
conservation of energy, and

122
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,280
we're assuming that this is a
frictionless system, and that

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,730
nothing is being lost to
heat or whatever else.

124
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,000
So the work in has to be
equal to the work out.

125
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,590
And so what's the work in?

126
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,310
Well, it's the force that I'm
applying downward times the

127
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,430
distance of the force.

128
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,670
So this is the work in.

129
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,500
Force times the distance
of the force.

130
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,880
I'm going to switch colors
just to keep things

131
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,050
interesting.

132
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,120
And that has to be the same
thing as the work out.

133
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,770
Well, what's the work out?

134
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,190
It's the force of the weight
pulling downwards.

135
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,700
So we have to-- it's essentially
the lifting force

136
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,330
of the lever.

137
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,320
It has to counteract the force
of the weight pulling

138
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,950
downwards actually.

139
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,610
Sorry I mis-said it
a little bit.

140
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,030
But this lever is essentially
going to be

141
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,820
pushing up on this weight.

142
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,190
The weight ends up here.

143
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,200
So it pushes up with the
force equal to the

144
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,300
weight of the object.

145
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,040
So that's the weight of the
object, which is -- I said

146
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,440
it's a 10 newton object -- So
it's equal to 10 newtons.

147
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,250
That's the force.

148
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,190
The upward force here.

149
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,630
And it does that for
a distance of what?

150
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,480
We figured out this object, this
weight, moves up with a

151
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,730
distance d sub w.

152
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:18,200
   

153
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,380
And we know what the distance
of the force is in terms of

154
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,760
the distance of w.

155
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,360
So we could rewrite this as
force times, substitute here,

156
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,930
2 d w is equal to 10 d w.

157
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:43,830
Divide both sides by 2 you d w
and you get force is equal to

158
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,150
10 d w 2 two d w, which is
equaled to, d w's cancel out,

159
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,510
and you're just left with 5.

160
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,090
So this is interesting.

161
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,500
And I think you'll see where
this is going, and we did it

162
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,490
little complicated this time.

163
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,490
But hopefully you'll realize
a general theme.

164
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,790
This was a 10 newton weight.

165
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,700
And I only had to press down
with 5 newtons in order to

166
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,460
lift it up.

167
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,500
But at the same time, I pressed
down with 5 newtons,

168
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,880
but I had to push down
for twice as long.

169
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,880
So my force was half as much,
but my distance that I had to

170
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,190
push was twice as much.

171
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,470
And here the force is twice as
much but the distance it

172
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,480
traveled is half as much.

173
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,350
So what essentially just
happened here is, I

174
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,640
multiplied my force.

175
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,490
And because I multiplied
my force, I

176
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,100
essentially lost some distance.

177
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,710
But I multiplied my
force, because I

178
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,320
inputted a 5 newton force.

179
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,200
And I got a 10 newton force out,
although the 10 newton

180
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,030
force traveled for
less distance.

181
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,230
Because the work was constant.

182
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,460
And this is called mechanical
advantage.

183
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,450
If I have an input force of 5,
and I get an output force of

184
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,250
10, the mechanical
advantage is 2.

185
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,660
So mechanical advantage is equal
to output force over

186
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,260
input force, and that should
hopefully make a little

187
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,910
intuitive sense to you.

188
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,220
And another thing that maybe
you're starting to realize

189
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,110
now, is that proportion of the
mechanical advantage was

190
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,480
actually the ratio of this
length to this length.

191
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,660
And we figured that out by
taking the tangent and doing

192
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,670
these ratios.

193
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,200
But in general, it makes sense,
because this force

194
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,340
times this distance has
to be equal to this

195
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,820
force times this distance.

196
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,410
And we know that the distance
this goes up is proportional

197
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,169
to the length of from the
fulcrum to the weight.

198
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,340
And we know on this side the
distance that you're pushing

199
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,260
down, is proportional to the
length from where you're

200
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,020
applying the weight
to the fulcrum.

201
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,640
And now I'll introduce you
to a concept of moments.

202
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,890
In just a moment.

203
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,470
   

204
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,240
So in general, if I have, and
this is really all you have to

205
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,350
learn, that last thought
exercise was just

206
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,370
to show it to you.

207
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:03,740
If I have a fulcrum here, and
if we call this distance d 1

208
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,590
and we called this
distance d 2.

209
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:12,335
And if I want to apply
an upward force here,

210
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,770
let's call this f 1.

211
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:20,830
And I have a downward force,
f 2, in this machine.

212
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:27,970
f 2 times d 2 is equal
to d 1 times f 1.

213
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,220
And this is really all
you need to know.

214
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,630
And this just all falls
out of the work in is

215
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,880
equal to the work out.

216
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,540
Now, this quantity isn't
exactly the work in.

217
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,520
The work in was this force--
sorry, F2-- is this force

218
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,130
times this distance.

219
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,370
But this distance is
proportional to this distance,

220
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,610
and that's what you
need to realize.

221
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,610
And this quantity right here is
actually called the moment.

222
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,560
In the next video, which I'll
start very soon because this

223
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,730
video is about to end.

224
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,660
I'm running out of time.

225
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,330
I will use these quantities to
solve a bunch of mechanical

226
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,560
advantage problems. See
