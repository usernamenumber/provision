1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,220
Well we already know that
definite integrals can help us

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,240
figure out areas underneath
curves or between curves.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,930
What we'll show in this video
is that you can actually use

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,950
pretty much the exact same
principles to figure out the

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,580
volumes of rotational solids.

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,490
So what do I mean?

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,060
So let me just draw a
couple of examples.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:26,220
So let me start with a fairly
straightforward function.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,980
That's my y-axis.

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,930
This is my x-axis.

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,885
Let me draw my function.

13
00:00:32,885 --> 00:00:35,840
   

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,500
I'm going to draw y equals the
square root of x, but I'll keep

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,090
it general right now, just so
this applies generally

16
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,210
to a lot of things.

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,560
So y equals the square root of
x looks something like that.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,590
It keeps going.

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,685
Actually, let me redraw that,
because I didn't want it

20
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:51,990
to curve down like
that at the end.

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,410
It goes up like that,
and then it just keeps

22
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,260
going up like that.

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,210
That's better.

24
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:56,980
OK.

25
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,910
So we'll call that f of x.

26
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,900
This is our x-axis.

27
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,220
This is our y-axis.

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,390
And we already know that if
we wanted to figure out

29
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,980
the area under this curve
between two points.

30
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,445
Let's say between the point
a-- well, we can do it

31
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:16,060
between any two points.

32
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,950
Let's say this point a and this
point b, and we wanted to find

33
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,390
this area between
the two curves.

34
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,925
   

35
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:26,700
I'm drawing everything
crooked today.

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,980
Let me do a different color.

37
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,730
   

38
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,990
If we wanted this area right
here, we would essentially just

39
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,690
be-- just as a review-- be
summing up a bunch of small

40
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,060
squares, where each square has
a bunch of rectangles, has a

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,240
width dx, and its height at
that point would be whatever x

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,530
value here is-- it
would be f of x.

43
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,100
And if we take the sum of all
of these areas, of all of these

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,990
rectangles, we would get
the area to this curve.

45
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,430
And we learned in the definite
integral video that that's just

46
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,930
equal to the definite integral
from a-- that's a lower bound--

47
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:13,440
from a to b of f of
x times d of x.

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,100
Where each [? rafter ?]

49
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,810
angle is f of x times d of x.

50
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,030
And hopefully this makes a
little bit of intuitive

51
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,480
sense to you.

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,370
I think a lot of people go
through calculus just learning

53
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,160
how to do it mechanistically,
just learning you know how to

54
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,040
do it like a robot without
really understanding

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,320
necessarily what's going on.

56
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,180
And if you understand what's
going on, you'll never be

57
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,210
really lost when you see
something a little bit

58
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,170
different than what you
might have practiced.

59
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,340
So with that out of the way,
let's think about something.

60
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,690
What if we took this
function and we rotated

61
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,270
it about the x-axis.

62
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,440
So this might take a little bit
of visualization, but what you

63
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,650
imagine is-- let me
see if I can draw.

64
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,370
So I take this curve and if I
were to rotate it about the

65
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,370
x-axis, it would look
something like this.

66
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,800
   

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,650
It would look like a
sideways copper vase.

68
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,152
   

69
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:12,730
It would look like that, where
that would be the opening.

70
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,080
That would be the
opening on the inside.

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,570
I can even shade it.

72
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,610
Show you my drawing skills.

73
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,220
OK.

74
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,890
Hopefully that make sense.

75
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,580
You know, that would be the
y-axis there, and the x-axis

76
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,050
would pop out the middle.

77
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,000
That's if you took this and
you rotated it around.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,210
So let me draw an arrow to show
that we're rotating it around.

79
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,360
   

80
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,980
And if we did that, what would
be the volume created by--

81
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,830
well let's use the same
boundaries, between a and b.

82
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,240
So if we took this piece and we
rotated it around, what would

83
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,110
it look like between a and b.

84
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,325
It would look
something like this.

85
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:54,410
   

86
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,360
Let me see if I can draw it.

87
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:04,910
So you would have a-- whoops,
I'm not trying that well.

88
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,370
This is really testing the
limits of my ability to use

89
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,750
this computer to draw things.

90
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,560
   

91
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,700
It'd be kind of a circle on one
end, and then it would curve

92
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:25,030
down a little bit and it would
be another circle

93
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,180
on the other end.

94
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,480
And if I were to draw the
x-axis, the x-axis would

95
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,370
kind of pop out of the
middle right there.

96
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,810
That right there would be
the point b, x equals b.

97
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,340
If we were to kind of go behind
or look into the object we

98
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,950
would see the other surface
of this rotational solid.

99
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,925
And this point right
here, that would be a.

100
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:56,460
   

101
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,520
That would be a.

102
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,500
And then of course the x-axis
would keep going, and then

103
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,570
that would be the y-axis.

104
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,150
   

105
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,770
The visualization really
is the hardest part

106
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,280
about these problems.

107
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,620
So first just actually
imagine what you're doing.

108
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,960
So I just did this section, if
I rotated it about the x-axis.

109
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,680
But if I were to draw the whole
curve, the whole curve would

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,920
look something like this.

111
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,330
It would look something
like that, and we're

112
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,410
just rotating it around.

113
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,215
Hopefully that makes sense.

114
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,810
We're rotating it
around that way.

115
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,640
So how do we do that?

116
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,540
Well we use the exact
same principle.

117
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,870
When we figured out the area,
we would figure out the area of

118
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,920
each of these small squares,
and then we would take the sum

119
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,780
of an infinite number of
infinitely small squares,

120
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,000
and we got this.

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,220
So to do the volume, what we
do is instead of having each

122
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,170
rectangle, we kind of rotate
each of these rectangles

123
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,650
around the x-axis.

124
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,660
   

125
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:10,920
If that's the rectangle,
it has width dx, and

126
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,070
it has height f of x.

127
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,870
   

128
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,240
So this height right here,
that's f of x at this point.

129
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,930
If I were to rotate this
rectangle around the x-axis,

130
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,860
what do I end up with?

131
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,040
Well I'll end up with a disk.

132
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,460
Let me see if I can draw
that reasonably well.

133
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,430
I'm trying to show you some
perspective when I draw.

134
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,050
   

135
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,670
So that would be the top
surface of the disk.

136
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,030
And this would be the
side of the disk.

137
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,430
   

138
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,010
And so this is the top
surface at the disk.

139
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,360
And what would be the radius
of this disk, what would

140
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,610
be this height right here?

141
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,260
Well that radius, that's
going to be f of x.

142
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,630
That's this height.

143
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,310
Imagine if you took this and
rotated it around, that's the

144
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,050
same thing as this height
right here, right?

145
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,050
So that height or the radius
of the disk is f of x.

146
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,230
And then what's the
width of the disk?

147
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,350
Well that's just d of x.

148
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,430
That's the same thing as this.

149
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,080
We just rotated it around.

150
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,390
So what would be the
volume of this disk?

151
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,520
It would be the
area of this side.

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,780
It'll be this area right
here times this height.

153
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,930
Well what's the area?

154
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,310
Well we know the radius, right?

155
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,805
Area is equal to pi r squared.

156
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:44,920
   

157
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,550
What's this radius?

158
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,060
My radius is f of x, right?

159
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,620
So the area of this disk is
equal to pi times the radius

160
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:03,100
squared, it so it's pi times f
of x, the whole thing squared.

161
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,010
So what would be the volume
of this entire disk?

162
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,620
So it'll just be
this area times dx.

163
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,890
I'm running out of
space and colors.

164
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:19,700
So the volume of that disk is
going to be equal to area of

165
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,010
that disk, pi f of x squared.

166
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,500
The whole function, whatever
length this is at any point

167
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,390
squared, that gives us the
area, times the depth you

168
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,980
can say, so that's d of x.

169
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,340
Now that gives us just the
volume of this one disk

170
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,880
when it's rotated around.

171
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,080
So if we wanted the volume of
this entire object that I drew

172
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,900
here, we would just sum up
a bunch of these disks.

173
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,910
We would take each of these
rectangles, rotate them around,

174
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,370
figure out the volume of that
disk it creates, and

175
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,780
then sum them up.

176
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,980
And so essentially we're going
to take an infinite sum of a

177
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,250
bunch of these small
little disks so we can

178
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,380
take the integral.

179
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,160
So this is the volume
of each disk.

180
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,450
We could call that a
volume of a disk.

181
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,720
So what's the volume
of the whole thing?

182
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,700
Well we just take a sum,
an integral sum of

183
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,110
each of these disks.

184
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:19,040
So the volume when you rotate
it is going to be equal to the

185
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,370
definite integral between-- and
remember, our boundaries were a

186
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:29,920
and b-- between a and b of this
quantity right here--

187
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:39,950
pi f of x squared dx.

188
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,820
So hopefully that
makes sense to you.

189
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,340
Just remember, this is
the width of each disk.

190
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,900
This is the radius of the disk,
or the radius of the surface,

191
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,555
so it would be squared, and
that makes sense, that's

192
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:51,390
the height, f of x.

193
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,520
And we have pi r squared, so
that's where the pi comes from.

194
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,780
Some people just memorize that.

195
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,140
I don't recommend you do that,
and we'll see that later.

196
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,290
But I'm out of time.

197
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,450
In the next video I'll
actually apply this

198
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,685
to an actual problem.

199
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:02,940
See you soon.

200
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,400
