1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:04,203
This is Sal, and I am still at Stanford Medical School with Dr. Connely.

2
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:08,940
C: "Sal, we're going to continue. Sal, you're going to have to get one unit of credit for today."

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,262
S: "Oh, my mother would be proud!"

4
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:15,256
C: "So, what we're looking at today is a colon polyp."

5
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:25,797
S: "So, what we saw in the last video was not a polyp, but an irritated part of the bowel?"

6
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:34,110
C: Yeah, it was very low lying, it was really just a patch of irritant.

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,030
C: We have a bigger piece now, so you can see the glands look tiny here.

8
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,909
S: So on the last slide, about how big would it be on here?

9
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:51,107
C: It would be about a piece like that. To be fair, it was probably what was underlying this area here.

10
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:55,612
C: And then, it grew on to be something more.

11
00:00:55,612 --> 00:01:00,116
S: It wasn't this exact one, but it could've grown on to be something like this.

12
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:06,107
C: Yes. When we have a colon resection, if there's a cancer, there's often a polyp...

13
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,776
...an area, a patch like we saw with hyperplasia.

14
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:13,723
S: [The patch is] not necessarily where the cancer is, just [the cancer would be close]?

15
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:18,925
C: Yeah, we find that if people have a colon cancer, they have a lot of pre-cancer regions.

16
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:22,779
S: So, you can see that their bowel has been going through a lot of trauma.

17
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:28,259
C: Some of its familial susceptibility, but a lot of it is that they are showing a propensity to do this...

18
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,092
...don't know if it's from environmental exposures or what.

19
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:37,454
S: I see. So just to remind myself on what we're doing here, you cut out a piece of colon...

20
00:01:37,454 --> 00:01:44,606
...because there was cancer there, and there might be a polyp in the same section

21
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:49,111
that you cut out, and that 2nd slide where we saw the irritation might be right there.

22
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:55,751
C: As a matter of fact, it's important you normally wouldn't see this slide in a patient,

23
00:01:55,751 --> 00:02:04,250
because almost all polyps, the colonoscopist is coming in, and they remove it through the colonoscope.

24
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,804
S: Because they don't know if it's cancer or not.

25
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:11,727
C: They'll remove it, but you wouldn't see the full wall. So right here, that's all the way through t

26
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:16,603
wall and what you got here is muscle. So this really a full piece of the wall.

27
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:28,677
C: So this is a larger piece, to show the polyp in its natural environment.

28
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:42,516
C: So we're going to look at the polyp. First, way out here, the normal architecture

29
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:48,368
C: So we said there are supposed to be tubes. Luckily, this one is cut right down the middle of the tubes

30
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,551
C: so you can see how big the holes are.

31
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:57,470
C: So, this is normal architecture there. If I go out a little bittle, you'll see an area here

32
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:04,529
in which there is a bit of irritation. So, it's a thrown up [?] a bit like we saw before,

33
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:11,449
but the real trouble is this thing sticking out. And we wonder, what is this thing sticking out.

34
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:17,207
C: And so, for the medical students, we tell them to think like the pathologists,

35
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:23,662
First need to look at the overall architecture: This is an abnormal architecture.

36
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,845
We don't usually see a polyp sticking out.

37
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:29,096
S: In 3D, would it look like a mushroom?

38
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:33,647
C: Yeah. Actually, they tend to have a folding in the tops so they are more like cauliflower.

39
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,226
S: Color?

40
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:44,653
C: They don't have much color to them. The colonoscopist, when they look at them,

41
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:49,204
can kinda tell if there's a chance of cancer because they begin having weird blood vessels.

42
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:51,898
S: Just to be clear, they're not this purplish color.

43
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:57,842
C: No, we have to stain these thin-sections or it would be colorless.

44
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:05,040
C: So now, I am going to draw an area where I'm going to do a comparison. See this box here?

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:17,022
C: So these are cells which are relatively normal. And these [on the top] are cells which are abnormal.

46
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:20,551
C: A pathologist immediately say, "These look angry."

47
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,545
S: They do! They do look angry! I would say that, too!

48
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:28,585
C: What's angry about them: First of all, they are not committed to behaving.

49
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:36,155
C: Proper behavior over here: nuclei belong at the bottom; things you're supposed to do for your job

50
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:42,471
are at the top. So, when you look at these guys, you're like, "Where's your job?"

51
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:48,369
C: And so, a few of them are making mucin, but these ones have nuclei of different sizes and shapes.

52
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:54,034
C: They're just doing their own thing, not producing mucin, all they're doing is growing.

53
00:04:54,034 --> 00:05:01,465
C: Usually there's a playoff between, if you're committed to your specific job, we call it differentiation.

54
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:07,548
C: So if you're committed to your differentiation, you tend not to have as much propensity to grow,

55
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:11,031
and if you grow a lot, you tend not to do the differentiation.

56
00:05:11,031 --> 00:05:19,390
C: And so, this is largely that you have this chaos of nuclei, less commitment to the normal structures,

57
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,991
and you're not producing as much.

58
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:31,233
C: And so, what this is, is this is now called 'dysplasia.' ['Dys' is from Greek for 'mal'; malformation.]

59
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:36,898
C: We're saying: We don't like their looks. These individual cells look dysplastic in their growth.

60
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:47,812
C: So then, to tell whether it's cancer: Cancer means, in this organ, that you've grown across this line

61
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:49,716
in the sand.

62
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,363
S: So, literally, if you've crossed this boundary--cancer.

63
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:54,360
C: Right.

64
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,703
S: So, even if I'm in the polyp up here and I'm growing uncontrollably,

65
00:05:57,703 --> 00:06:00,676
and mutated and not killing itself [when it should; not responding to apoptotic signals]

66
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:03,416
you still would not officially call it cancer?

67
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:10,892
C: No, what happens is that there is a middle-term for a cancer that remains in its usual place:

68
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:13,121
That's "carcinoma in situ."

69
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:19,669
C: So, carcinoma in situ means that it's not an invasive cancer,

70
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:22,874
so most people would not even call it a cancer.

71
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:26,543
But it's just so wild looking up here, you know that it would [become "real cancer"]

72
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:28,772
if given chance and time.

73
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:35,552
S: What we're saying is that if there were carcinoma in situ out here, that it eventually would make

74
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,038
its way.

75
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,889
C: Right, it would continue to grow, because there is so little differentiation that you know it would

76
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:45,397
continue to grow until [it became cancer.]

77
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:50,366
C: With here, though, it's still dysplasia, where it's upsetting that it's growing so fast,

78
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:54,035
but what's important about this, is that in hyperplasia, if you took away the stimulus or irritant,

79
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:58,725
it would go back to normal--this would not [go back to normal.]

80
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:05,227
S: If the irritant were removed in hyperplasia, it would go away in time.

81
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:07,363
S: This dysplasia is here to stay.

82
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:11,357
C: So the key word is "autonomous." So it will grow no matter what.

83
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:19,531
It doesn't care about clues from neighboring cells, it doesn't need something driving it,

84
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:27,797
so what you have then is if this is growing, and if it's growing all by itself, it's called a "neoplasia."

85
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,676
S: So neoplasia means showing dysplasia?

86
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:41,822
C: Dysplasia is when you look at these features, these cells aren't growing right.

87
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:47,255
C: And then, overall, this lump is a "new growth," a neoplasia.

88
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:55,382
We reserve the term in the medical field for meaning: It's growing on its own.

89
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:58,912
S: How do we know it's new? How do we know it wasn't around for a year?

90
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:06,249
C: I think it was. It probably came from this area here,

91
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:09,825
and the thinking is that you probably had irritant here, hence hyperplasia,

92
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:12,797
it would continue to grow--cells divide, cells divide too much,

93
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:15,816
and then, [mutations occur (cancerous cells are rarely a result of only 1 mistake)],

94
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:22,867
the cell says, "You know what? From now on, I'm not listening to any clues."

95
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,152
S: And then, its descendants would be crazy, too?

96
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:28,842
C: Right, they would have a real mean streak. And then they would grow from here.

97
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,464
S: (I see that pattern in my own family!)

98
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:38,316
C: So here, these are more normal glands, but even these--that's dysplasia.

99
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:42,867
C: So these are growing without a good pattern of growth.

100
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:46,118
And overall, this lump, is a neoplasia.

101
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:50,344
S: So when we say "new," we mean, "newer than the other tissue"?

102
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:57,496
C: We don't mean newer than the other so much as it's its own thing.

103
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,678
C: New kid on the block.

104
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:10,174
C: So this one right here is a polyp, it has features of dysplasia, but we see no cancer.

105
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:16,164
S: How would you know? Oh, because it didn't cross the boundary line.

106
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:20,994
C: There is a reason why the boundary is important, because if you look here,

107
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:27,449
these are all the surface cells, down here, these are the vessels that go to the rest of the body.

108
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,700
C: So these are blood vessels, these are called lymphatics,

109
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,369
and what lymphatics are, they take the clear fluid [v. blood fluid]

110
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:38,920
S: These right here, these are the lymphatics, the clear fluid.

111
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,332
S: Fluid can go back and forth between the blood vessels and the lymph system?

112
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:47,511
C: Yeah, usually what happens is: Blood comes in an artery like this,

113
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:52,155
goes on down to these little vessels, and then a little bit of the clear parts of it,

114
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:54,292
will kind of leak out.

115
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,149
S: The blood cells are too big [to leak]?

116
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:01,490
C: Yeah. So, some clear stuff comes out, and this is how it returns to the rest of your body,

117
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,626
through these lymphatics.

118
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:06,923
C: So you can see, you do not want neoplastic cells in here.

119
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:10,313
S: Right, because once they are in there they can go to any part of the body.

120
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:13,843
C: Go to a new place, and guess what? Set up shop, new kids on the block, they just do what they wanna.

121
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:16,815
S: So that's called...I can't pronounce it...

122
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:20,298
C: Metastasis. So, metastasis would be, if it gets into these things,

123
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:22,713
it can get out of the colon and go anywhere.

124
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:29,168
C: So this is one where it is not cancer, it has not invaded these areas where it can [metastasize.]

125
00:10:29,168 --> 99:59:59,999
S: Fascinating.
