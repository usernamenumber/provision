1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,150
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,010
I don't know what
I was thinking.

4
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,420
Sometimes my brain
malfunctions.

5
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,160
But just going back to that
problem we were doing, actually

6
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,970
I think we should do it.

7
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm a little
schizophrenic today.

8
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,210
So let's figure out
the equation for the

9
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,220
volume of a sphere.

10
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,630
So what's the equation?

11
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,900
It's x squared plus y squared
is equal to r squared.

12
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,630
And let's just write y as
a function of x, just so

13
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,370
we can do it the way we
did that last problem.

14
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,200
So you get y squared is equal
to r squared minus x squared.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,800
y is equal to the square root
of r squared minus x squared.

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,410
And let's draw it.

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:45,190
So if this is my y-axis, this
is my x-axis, and the

18
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:52,420
equation-- draw it straight--
that's my x-axis, and then I

19
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,190
actually have a circle tool,
let me see if I can use it

20
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:10,760
effectively-- well,
close enough.

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,190
There you go.

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,390
I think you get the point.

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,360
But anyway.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,570
This is just going to be the
upper half of the circle.

25
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,330
Actually, I should probably
just undo that circle tool

26
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,590
and try to draw it by hand.

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,950
So y equals the square root of
r squared minus x squared.

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,470
That's just going to be the
upper half of the circle.

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:34,000
So it will be the positive x
quadrant-- and then actually,

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,200
I should have drawn
the whole hemisphere.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,350
But anyway.

32
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,970
Actually, let me do that,
because I think it'll

33
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:46,140
make-- edit, undo, let me
clear all of this out.

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,630
Sorry for wasting your time,
but I think it'll be effective.

35
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,990
OK.

36
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,775
So let me redraw.

37
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:54,460
   

38
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:03,720
So this, that's the y-axis,
that's my x-axis, and then

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,340
this-- the square root is,
since it's a function, it can

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,020
only have one value, so we
assume it's defined as the

41
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,500
positive square root.

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,490
So if we were to graph that,
it would look like this.

43
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,590
Something like that, where this
would be minus r and that's r.

44
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,910
So if we want to find the
volume of a sphere with radius

45
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,910
r, we just have to rotate this
function around the x-axis.

46
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,740
This is the x-axis,
that's the y-axis.

47
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,330
So let's see what we can do.

48
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,690
Let's just visualize
the disks again.

49
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,850
So let me make a disk.

50
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:49,790
So let's say that that's the
side of one of the disks again,

51
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,670
and as we know, the depth of
the disk is just

52
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,590
going to be dx.

53
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,000
That's how wide
that disk is, dx.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,210
And its radius at any point is
f of x, and in this case, it's

55
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,180
y is equal to square root of
r squared minus x squared.

56
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,740
So what's the surface
area of each disk?

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,880
What's this?

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,900
The surface area of
each of the disks.

59
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,420
I hope you know
what I'm saying.

60
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,850
So area is equal to pi r
squared, the radius at any

61
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,490
point is equal to this, radius
is equal to y which is equal to

62
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,770
square root-- and remember,
this is not this r.

63
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,520
This is the radius
of this disk.

64
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,500
I know it might be a
little confusing.

65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,360
   

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,940
y is equal to the square root
of r squared minus x squared.

67
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,680
So the area is going to equal
pi times this squared.

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,650
So if you square this quantity,
you just get rid of the

69
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,560
square root sign, right?

70
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,600
So pi r squared minus x
squared, and that's the

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,020
area, and so what's the
volume of that disk?

72
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,900
Well just like we've done in
every video up to this point,

73
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,350
the volume of that disk is just
that, so the volume of that

74
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:05,470
disk is just this pi r squared
minus x squared times dx.

75
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,860
And so if we want to figure out
the volume of all these disks,

76
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,255
I have a disk here, a disk
here, going around and around

77
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:12,330
and around and around and
around and they get smaller and

78
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,340
smaller until we have a sphere.

79
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,020
We just take the integral, the
upper bound is positive r, the

80
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,940
lower bound is minus r, and we
take the integral of

81
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,980
this expression.

82
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,240
pi-- let me distribute it,
because that's going to make it

83
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:37,090
easier-- pi r squared, which is
just a constant term, minus pi

84
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,560
x squared, all of that dx.

85
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,870
So what's the antiderivative
of that expression?

86
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,270
The antiderivative
within the parentheses.

87
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,630
Well, this is just
a constant term.

88
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,090
pi r squared, that's just a
number, because we're just

89
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,550
taking the integral
with respect to x.

90
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:04,660
So the antiderivative of pi r
squared is just pi r squared x,

91
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,370
the derivative of pi r squared
x is just pi r squared, minus--

92
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,160
and we did this in
the last video.

93
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,670
Actually, well now, it's the
antiderivative x squared, which

94
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:18,860
is x to the third over 3, and
the pi is just a constant, so

95
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,670
pi x to the third over 3, and
we're going to evaluate

96
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,440
that at r and minus r.

97
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,940
Let me erase some stuff, looks
like I'm running out of space.

98
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,690
   

99
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,840
Hopefully all of that
you know by now.

100
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,620
OK, back to the pen tool.

101
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:45,910
OK.

102
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,080
So let's evaluate it at r.

103
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:58,920
So this is pi r squared, and
then for x, we'll substitute

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:07,440
the positive r times r minus pi
x cubed, but now we have this r

105
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:21,870
here, so r cubed over 3 minus
pi r squared, and then we have

106
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,290
a minus r here, because we're
evaluating the antiderivative

107
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:36,120
at minus r, times minus r,
minus pi minus r cubed.

108
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,240
So what's minus r cubed?

109
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,370
It's r cubed, but we'll
keep the minus sign.

110
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,540
r cubed, and at that minus
sign, let's just make

111
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,650
that-- that'll turn that
into a plus-- over 3.

112
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,070
Let's see if we can clean
this up a little bit.

113
00:06:49,070 --> 00:07:01,300
So that first term is pi r
cubed, r squared times r, minus

114
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,780
essentially 1/3pi r cubed.

115
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,310
And then, what is this?

116
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,410
This is pi r cubed, but then
we have a minus sign up.

117
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,090
This is minus pi r cubed, and
then we have a minus sign up

118
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:28,310
here, so this becomes plus pi r
cubed, and then minus-- because

119
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,830
we have a plus here and a minus
out here, so distribute it--

120
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:37,610
so minus 1/3pi r cubed.

121
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,420
And let's see, what do we have?

122
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,680
We have essentially 1.

123
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,780
If we just distribute out the
pi r cubes, we have pi r cubed

124
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:57,200
times 1 minus 1/3
plus 1 minus 1/3.

125
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,820
Well that's 2 minus 2/3, or
another way, let's see, is 2

126
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,120
minus 2/3-- this is turning
into a fractions problem-- and

127
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,970
what's-- well, that's 6/3
minus 2/3, it equals 4/3.

128
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,280
So this is equal to 4/3.

129
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:23,780
So the volume of the sphere is
equal to 4/3 pi r cubed, which

130
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,240
is the equation for the
volume of a sphere.

131
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,760
And actually, now that
I realize, it did take

132
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,190
me eight and a half
minutes, so I am glad.

133
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,310
My first intuition is always
correct, I am glad I did

134
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,170
this in a separate video.

135
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,650
But that should be pretty
interesting to you.

136
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,840
And it makes a lot of sense.

137
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,800
It's going to be a cube of
the radius, pi is involved.

138
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,950
The 4/3 is interesting, just
in terms of how it relates

139
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,400
to everything else.

140
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,950
Area is pi r squared, and then
all of a sudden you get a 4/3

141
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,360
here, so it is something
for you to think about.

142
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,130
Anyway, hopefully
you found that fun.

143
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,930
I'll see you in the next video.

144
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,400
