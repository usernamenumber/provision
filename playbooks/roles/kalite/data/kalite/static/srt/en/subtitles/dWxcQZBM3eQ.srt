2
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:11,109
We're in the British Museum and looking at one of the real treasures of early medieval British history.

3
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:15,327
This is the Sutton Hoo Ship Burial, which comes from East Anglia.

4
00:00:15,327 --> 00:00:17,939
It was found in a farm in the twentieth century.

5
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:22,263
I think it was 1938 that a series of mounds were excavated.

6
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:25,598
It was a series of burials, most of them had already been robbed.

7
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:28,729
But the largest one, they found a ship in it.

8
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:35,268
And in the ship was treasure, and we think originally, the body of the man who owned this material.

9
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:40,112
He would have lived in a moment when what would become England was in chaos.

10
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:44,022
The Roman Empire had fallen several hundred years earlier.

11
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:50,883
England had been part of the Roman Empire, but then through a series of invasions of Germanic tribes,

12
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:56,792
and invasions from Denmark, England had become a series of different kingdoms,

13
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,406
-Which were often at war with each other.

14
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,801
Which were often at war with each other.

15
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:04,843
Various attempts were made by people like Ethelbert to unite those kingdoms.

16
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:10,464
Also at this time Germanic tribes and Danish tribes were Christianized in the 500's and 600's.

17
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:17,518
So with the Sutton Hoo Ship Burial we have some very rare artifacts from a period

18
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:21,345
when there's not a lot of building, there's not a lot of paintings,

19
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:24,263
a very unstable period in medieval history.

20
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:29,724
You really get a sense of what that world was like from the things that we found in the burial.

21
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:35,090
You find objects of warfare, you find swords, you find this man's helmet, shields.

22
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,305
It's also very finely wrought material.

23
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,456
Probably one of the most famous objects is this purse lid.

24
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:45,340
-Which is made of gold and cloisonné.

25
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,664
-Yeah, got a little cloisonné.

26
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:51,651
The backing is a reconstruction; underneath it would have been a leather bag.

27
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:55,539
Which is long gone, only the gold and the glass have survived.

28
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,361
Let's take a close look at the style.

29
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:05,499
We have typical interlacing of abstract forms; also the introduction of animals.

30
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:09,425
Along the bottom we have on either side, it's a very symmetrical design,

31
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:15,074
frontal human figure who seems to be attacked on either side by wolves.

32
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:19,085
It looks pretty serious, you see that doubled almost as if it's a kind of mirror.

33
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:22,165
His mouth is open; he looks like he has a mustache.

34
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:27,206
His face is a circle ringed with a pattern that could almost function as hair.

35
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:30,730
But the mouth is open almost as if it's a kind of scream or a kind of distress.

36
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,532
His arms seem to be folded up and then those animals,

37
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:37,342
their mouths are open, and they seem to be ready to devour.

38
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:39,724
Or perhaps to tell him a secret, one or the other.

39
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:42,070
It's impossible to really know what's going on.

40
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,270
We read that expression on his face as one of horror.

41
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,311
But who knows? Maybe this is a suggestion of power.

42
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:52,842
That caution that you just suggested is really important.

43
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:55,572
This is all conjecture. We really have no idea.

44
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:56,106
That's absolutely right.

45
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:58,912
Let's go further inside and you see a kind of bird of prey

46
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,746
that seems to be attacking a more passive bird - do you see that?

47
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:04,011
Right, perhaps an eagle attacking another bird -

48
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:07,588
Yeah, perhaps a duck or something like that.

49
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,013
There is this beautiful interlacing, as you called it,

50
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:12,824
this kind of knotting which we'll see in Hiberno-Saxon art.

51
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:17,737
And then you've got this cloisonné, and in certain cases you've actually got garnet.

52
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:24,108
And so the cloisonné is this kind of division of areas using metal wire,

53
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:28,837
and then filling in those spaces in between with enamel.

54
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:33,868
It's interesting that almost everything in the ship burial has disintegrated.

55
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:35,557
Almost everything has rotted;

56
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:39,512
even the bones of the man that would have been buried have dissolved.

57
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:43,658
Really, what's survived is the enamel and the gold.

58
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:47,569
And we actually have the gold coins that were in this purse.

59
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:50,718
And you know, we're looking at something from the early 600's,

60
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:55,327
from a period in European history when so little remains

61
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:58,963
for us to understand what it was like during this period.

62
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:01,922
But we do get a sense of what their costume must have been like,

63
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:05,472
from the purse lid, from the belt buckles, from the shoulder clasps . . .

64
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:11,400
Or at least, the costume of a very wealthy, very powerful, likely king.

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,400
