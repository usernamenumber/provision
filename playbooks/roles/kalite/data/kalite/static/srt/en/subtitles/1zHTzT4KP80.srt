1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,070
We're on problem number 10.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:15,080
Problem 10-- if 2x minus 2, times 2 minus x, is equal to

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,010
0, what are all possible values of x?

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,010
If I multiply two numbers, right, I multiply two

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,070
expressions equal to 0, that means one or both of these

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,000
expressions are going to be equal to 0.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,090
And if you've solved for roots of a quadratic using

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,010
factoring, you'll be familiar with this notion.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:41,010
So either 2x minus 2 is 0, and or, actually, either of these

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,060
could be equal to 0, or both of them

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,030
could be equal to zero.

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,020
Let's just solve this.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,010
So add 2 to both sides, 2x is equal to 2, x is equal to 1.

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,040
And here, if we just add x to both sides, we get 2 is equal

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,050
to x, or x is equal to 2.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,050
So x could be 1, or x could be 2.

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,090
So choice D, 1 and 2 only.

18
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,050
And you could try them out, right?

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,010
If x is 1, this becomes 0 times 1, which is of course 0.

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,070
If x is 2, this becomes 2, right?

21
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,050
2 times 2 minus 2 is 2.

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,000
Times 0, which is 0.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,080
And 0 doesn't work.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,070
That might have been your temptation, but if you put 0

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,020
in here, you get minus 2-- because this term will go

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,070
away-- you get minus 2 times 2, which is minus 4, so that

27
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,000
doesn't work.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You just have to set each of these expressions to 0.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,040
Next question, problem 11.

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:50,050
If x to the third is equal to y to the ninth, what is x in

31
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,000
terms of y?

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,040
So what we can do here is we just want to get rid of this

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,070
cubed power.

34
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,060
So how do we get rid of the cubed power?

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, we could take the cube root of both sides.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,030
If that doesn't make sense to you, I'll show you how.

37
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,000
x to the third-- let me give this some breathing room-- is

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,090
equal to y to the ninth.

39
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,040
I'm just writing the same thing a little bit bigger.

40
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,000
What we do to one side of the equation, we can do to the

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,080
other side of the equation.

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,020
If I want this exponent to be 1, I just have to take it to

43
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,080
the 1/3 power.

44
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,060
How do I know that?

45
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, if I take something to an exponent, and then take it

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,030
to another exponent, I essentially just multiply the

47
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,020
two exponents, right?

48
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,080
That's an exponent rule.

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,030
And you can review that in the exponent videos.

50
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,050
If you multiply 3 and 1/3, you get 1, so that's why I'm

51
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,050
raising to the 1/3 power.

52
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,080
And that, of course, is the same thing as

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
taking the cube root.

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,010
Excuse me, I just had some chicken, I need to drink some

55
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:46,890
water or something.

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,070
But of course, if I do something to one side of the

57
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,020
equation, I have to do it to both sides of

58
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,020
this equation, right?

59
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,030
If I take the cube root of one side, for the equation to

60
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,030
hold, I have to take the cube root of the other side.

61
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,080
So x to the third to the 1/3,well that's just x to the

62
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,000
first, or just x, right?

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,010
Because 3 times 1/3 is 1, so x to the first is just x.

64
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,070
And that equals what?

65
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,050
y to the 9 times 1/3.

66
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,050
Well what's 9 times-- 9 times 1/3 is equal to 9 divided by

67
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,010
3, which is equal to 3.

68
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,080
So x is equal to y to the third power.

69
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,070
That's just this 3.

70
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,060
And that is choice C.

71
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,000
Next problem.

72
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,010
I will switch colors for variety.

73
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,040
And there's something that I have to draw.

74
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,010
OK.

75
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:47,040
So they drew-- let's see if I can pull this one off.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,050
Let's see if I can pull drawing this figure off.

77
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,090
So it looks like a line like that.

78
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,010
And a line like that.

79
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,040
And a line like that.

80
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
And then it has almost a mirror image

81
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,020
of a line like that.

82
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,050
Line like that.

83
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,090
Close enough.

84
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:20,080
And they're asking us, in the x-y coordinate system above,

85
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,000
which of the following line segments has a slope of

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,070
negative 1?

87
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,060
So what is a slope of negative 1?

88
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:32,070
A slope of negative 1 means that as we move to the right

89
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,060
1, we move down 1.

90
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,070
That's a slope of negative 1.

91
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,010
And if you're familiar with slopes a lot, just intuitively

92
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,070
you know that it looks something like this.

93
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,050
Slope of negative 1 looks something like that.

94
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,040
And if we look at the lines that they drew, all the

95
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,060
choices, the ones that are moving up are definitely not

96
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,050
our answer, right?

97
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,020
This one is moving up, so this one can't be the answer.

98
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,070
This one is moving up, so this can't be the answer.

99
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,040
This one's moving up, so this one can't be the answer.

100
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,060
So all of these lines-- the yellow ones that I haven't

101
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,050
scratched out-- all of these have negative slopes.

102
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,070
And we just have to figure out which one could be negative 1.

103
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:20,050
If we look at this slope here between point O and point A,

104
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,030
they mark off that this is 1, 2, 3, and this is 1.

105
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,090
So for this line, we went over 1, right?

106
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,060
We moved over 1, but we went down 3.

107
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,090
So this line has a slope of negative 3.

108
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,030
And similarly, they draw-- this goes out 1, 2, 3-- this

109
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:50,030
line, we have to go 3 for it to go-- we have to move in the

110
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,010
x-direction positive 3 for it to move down 1.

111
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,090
So this has a slope of 1/3.

112
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,000
And you can kind of tell that it goes down very gradually.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,030
Right?

114
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,080
Actually negative 1/3, sorry.

115
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,050
The rise is negative 1,and the run is 3.

116
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,060
Run is just how far you move in the x-direction, right?

117
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,020
The rise is negative 1,which is right there,

118
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,090
and the run is 3.

119
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,090
So we know that this isn't the answer.

120
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,070
So just by deductive reasoning,we know that this

121
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,060
is probably going to be our answer.

122
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,070
And it also looks like it has a slope negative 1.

123
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:32,060
And if you were to actually look at it, points D and C,

124
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:39,060
this is about-- if I just look at it by

125
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,060
inspection-- 1 comma 3.

126
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,080
And this looks like the point 3 comma 1, right here.

127
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,050
So what is the change in y over the change in x?

128
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,060
Well, the change in y is 3 minus 1, so that equals 2.

129
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,060
And the change in x is 1 minus 3, which is minus 2.

130
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,070
Which is minus 1.

131
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,040
Remember, when you calculate slope, you always have to use

132
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,040
the first-- if I use 3 the first time of the numerator, I

133
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,070
have to use 1 the first time in the denomator.

134
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,060
So 3, minus 1, over 1, minus 3, is the slope,

135
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,000
and it's minus 1.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,090
But if you're really good, you should just be able to look at

137
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,040
it and say, well that's the closest thing to negative 1,

138
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,020
because it's not too steep and not to shallow.

139
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,050
Next problem.

140
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,020
Oh, and so that is choice D, C, E-- choice E.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,080
Problem 13.

142
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,000
Kyle's lock combination consists of

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,040
three two digit numbers.

144
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,050
The combination satisfies the three conditions below.

145
00:07:47,050 --> 00:08:03,060
One number is odd, one number is a multiple of 5, and then

146
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,050
one month is the day of the month of Kyle's birthday.

147
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,090
So what do we know about that number?

148
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, it's a two digit number,so it has to be

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,090
between 01 and 31, right?

150
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,020
In order for it to be a birthday, it can't be-- OK.

151
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,080
If each number satisfies exactly one of the conditions,

152
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,030
which of the following could be the

153
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,020
combination to the lock?

154
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,080
So one number can't satisfy two of these conditions, and

155
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,040
then you have another number that satisfies none.

156
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Each of them has to do one of them.

157
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,070
So let's look at the choices.

158
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:50,070
Choice A is 14, 20, 13.

159
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,050
Let's see, which one could satisfy the odd?

160
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,020
Well this number is odd.

161
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,080
So let me see, if this condition is satisfied by this

162
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,040
number, it's odd.

163
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,090
What number is a multiple of 5?

164
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
So this condition-- well that's

165
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,090
satisfied by this number.

166
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,060
And what number is a day of the month?

167
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,090
Well, this looks pretty straightforward.

168
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,020
One number is a day of the month.

169
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,040
Well, 14 could be a day of a month.

170
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,000
And in general, in any SAT problem, and I'm seeing this

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,070
pattern more and more as I go through all of these practice

172
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,030
tests, is when they have a problem where they want you to

173
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,050
go through every choice, the answers tend to be one of the

174
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,070
first few choices, because they don't want you to waste a

175
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,080
lot of time.

176
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,020
So you should feel pretty comfortable if you did this

177
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,070
and you got choice A.

178
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,060
And if you want to see an example of what won't work,

179
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,020
I'm guessing B won't work.

180
00:09:43,020 --> 00:10:00,000
Choice B says 14, 25, 13.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,010
Actually, that doesn't look like it could satisfy.

182
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,030
If each number satisfies exactly one of the conditions,

183
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,020
which of the following could be the

184
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,050
combination to the lock?

185
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,070
Oh, exactly.

186
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,050
So why can't this one be?

187
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,060
Because this condition that one number is odd, it can only

188
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,050
be satisfied by one of the choices.

189
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,010
Oh, I'm running over, I'll see you in the next video.
