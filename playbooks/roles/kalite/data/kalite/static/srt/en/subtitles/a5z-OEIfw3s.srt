1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,956
Okay so fractal fractions.

2
00:00:01,956 --> 00:00:08,075
5 equals 5 okay, bear with me, now lets explode this 5 into 5ths: 25 5ths to be percise

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:12,479
Now I want to split it into 2 parts, 17 fifths and 8 fifths.

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:17,017
Could have been 1 plus 24, I don't care. Ok now I'm ready for the fun part

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:22,223
since this five down here is just as much a five as any five is five, such as this whole thing,

6
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:26,022
which is equivalent to five, lets go ahead and replace with that five,

7
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:29,163
with this messier looking but still very fivily five

8
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,906
this one too, oh and now we've got more fives

9
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:35,575
so we can do it again and again and again and then you

10
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:39,754
can give someone this whole thing and be like, WHOA! IT'S 5!!!

11
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:45,346
making things look more confusing than they actually are is a delicate art but it speaks to the true heart of algebra,

12
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:49,683
which is that you can shuffle numbers around all day, and as long as you follow the rules, it all works out.

13
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:55,916
Ok, here's another one, so you wanna do something with 7, maybe you could use 7 over 7, which is 1,

14
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,959
so you need 6 more, eeeehhh- why not just add it? There.

15
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:03,864
7 equals 7 over 7 plus 6 now you could replace one, or the other but why not both?

16
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:06,533
7 equals 7 over 7 plus 6

17
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,536
over 7 over 7 plus 6 plus

18
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,475
6 instead of writing it all again why not just extend this way

19
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:18,245
there we go, this equals 7 and you can actually

20
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:23,050
take this all the way to infinity the sevens kind of disappear but then again it didn't really matter

21
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,020
what they were in the first place as long as they're the same.

22
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,623
All these 7's could have been 3, or a billion, or pi to the i,

23
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:33,903
and this would still equal 7. As long als it's numerator equals it's denominator,

24
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:36,830
this fraction equals 1 and whatever else you may think of algebra,

25
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,368
at least it has the courtesy to make one plus six be seven every time.

26
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,005
The fractal structure of this first fraction was like a binary tree,

27
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,811
each layer with twice as many turns as the one above it, growing exponentially.

28
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:52,980
And this one does too, but sideways. Bus awsomely enough, this is obviously

29
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,984
an ABACABADABACABA pattern. That's a fractal pattern that's actually found

30
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,486
in lots of places, but I'm not going into that right now

31
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,990
My point is, if you name this innermost layer A, and the next B,

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,725
and the next C and the next D

33
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,860
and then try to read it from top to bottom

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,566
you get ABACABADABACABA, and, if your fraction was infinite,

35
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:18,068
you'd get ABACABADABACABA-EABACABADABACABA-FABACABADABACABA-EABACABADABACABA-GABACABADABACABA

36
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:21,475
and so on. Anyway, a foolish algebra teacher would teach you that algebra

37
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:27,381
is about Solving Equations, as if the goal of life is to get X on one side and the rest on the other

38
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:32,886
As if every fiber of your being should cry out in protest when you see X on the left side

39
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,956
and yet more X on the right side.

40
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,759
But you could replace that X with what it equals

41
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,331
and then you could do it again, and again, and each time your equation would still be true

42
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:46,675
How's THAT for getting rid of the X on this side?

43
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:51,271
And you could make equations even more confusing by remembering special numbers and identities

44
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,508
Write whatever you want: as long as you can sneak in a 'multiplied by 0'

45
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,010
you don't even have to bother knowing what the rest is.

46
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,115
Or, knowing that all you need is the top and bottom of the equation to be the same to equal 1,

47
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:05,919
these sixes don't need to be sixes. They could be threes, or 8 square root 13.

48
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,725
Or you could even make each layer different: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11: now look how confusing this is. Awesome!

49
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,607
Say you wanted to actually solve one of these things, say, you started with this puzzel:

50
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:21,235
What is 1/(1 + 1) but each 1 is 1 over 1 plus 1, and so on, all the way to infinity?

51
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:25,406
You could try doing it by hand, thinking maybe it'll converge on something

52
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:32,413
1/(1+1) is a half. So the next layer we'll use our half added up to one so this is one over one: One.

53
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:39,052
Three layers and you're back to 1/2. Uh-oh. Any whole number of layers is going to give either 1 or 1/2.

54
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,090
What could this possibly be? Well, you could try doing algebra to it

55
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,161
Say, all this equals X. Look, you isolated X on one side, and everything else on the other

56
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,740
and it doesn't help a bit, so take that, math teacher!

57
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,756
OK but if all this is X, than all this, which is the same as this, equals X

58
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:58,972
You can write this as 1 over x plus x which completely works. You can generate it all again

59
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,642
by replacing X with 1 over X plus X.

60
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,579
And now that you've got those helpful x's on the wrong side of the equation, you can solve it

61
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,816
and get the boring way to write this number, if you want.

62
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:12,953
One last fraction, this one with a caution sign. Say you want something to equal one

63
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:20,194
Split 1 into 1/2 + 1/2. These ones could be replaced with 1/2+1/2. Each time you do this, it works.

64
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:24,998
What happens if you go to infinity? It's weird, because if you look at any layer of two's

65
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,402
to see if it converges to something, the result is always two for each fraction

66
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:35,065
which might make you think that at infinity, it's also 2 for each fraction and therefore, 1 = 4?

67
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:39,012
And just looking at this, and trying to think it backwards, you might see 'all this equals x'

68
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:43,350
'and all this equals x' so it's x+x over 2. Just try and solve that equation!

69
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,421
The problem is, half of something plus half of something always equals that something

70
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,757
no matter what the x is. So this could be anything, it's undefined.

71
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:58,532
Or, say you want to make something with all ones, like this. Now, x=x+x over 1, or: x = x+x

72
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:03,136
You can algebra your way into a contradiction, and as far as algebra's concerned, it's undefined.

73
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,508
Or you could think "well, there's 2 numbers I know that fit this description: zero and infinity...

74
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:11,111
...this I suppose could be either, or both at once, or nothing at all, I don't know"

75
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:15,482
why does it do that? Maybe because the numerator got lost up there and could have been anything.

76
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:21,522
Interesting though, that even here where the denominator got lost in infinity, you can still solve it back to 5

77
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:26,894
That, to me, is the cool part of algebra. Unlike the neat little problems they put in gradeschool textbooks

78
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:32,032
not all problems can be solved and it's not always obvious when there's an answer and when there's not

79
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,869
Weird stuff happens all the time, and most importantly, algebra isn't a dead ancient thing

80
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:40,374
there are things no one has ever done before that you can do with the simplest concepts

81
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:43,891
as simple as that x is, what x is
