1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,810
I think now might be a good
time to address another

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,390
question that is probably
circulating in your head-- and

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,920
that is, what happened
to the gold?

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,000
Remember when we started this
reserve bank, all of these

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,180
national banks or whatever we
want to call them, they had

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,660
gold as a reserve.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,670
And then at some point, they
said, well, why are we each

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,410
holding gold?

10
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,630
Why don't we just all
concentrate our gold in one

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,030
reserve bank?

12
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,130
And then that reserve bank can
issue-- and it was the only

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,580
person that could issue-- it
could issue bank notes that

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,260
could be tradeable into gold.

15
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,370
And then we said, over time,
people just got used to the

16
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:43,420
notion of using the bank notes
themselves as reserves.

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,760
And that's what the reserve
ratios were all based on,

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,010
based on the bank notes
themselves.

19
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,060
And we talked about that if the
Fed or the reserve bank

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,900
wanted to increase the money
supply, it could essentially

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:59,460
just print new notes and it
would have offsetting notes,

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,970
outstanding liabilities, and
then it could use those to

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,900
perform open market transactions
and it

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,670
essentially allows it to grow
the monetary base with the

25
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,580
economy or with the needs of
different projects out there

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,480
so that those projects happen.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,840
And in that whole discussion,
you might have noticed that

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,790
this yellow stuff was
just sitting here.

29
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,110
It had nothing to do
with the economy.

30
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,550
It was just sitting there and if
you really wanted to force

31
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,370
me to say what it was doing,
well, it was giving a little

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,815
bit of confidence behind what
this thing was, right?

33
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:32,320
It gives you a little
bit of confidence.

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,770
Because at first, at least,
when we said that it was

35
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,960
backed by the gold-- there was
maybe a similar amount of gold

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,630
as there was there.

37
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,310
Maybe a little bit later, we
said, this could be exchanged

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,140
for gold at some rate--
maybe $35 per ounce.

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,160
I think that's what it
was when we were

40
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,010
last on the gold standard.

41
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,810
   

42
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,590
But if you think about
it, it's a couple of

43
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,180
weird things here.

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,450
First of all, almost from the
get-go when we did this, the

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,560
whole purpose of having this
flexible money supply is so

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,640
you can grow and contract money
with the needs of the

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,420
economy and we would, for the
most part, have notes

48
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,110
outstanding because this was a
fractional reserve system.

49
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,940
We would have notes outstanding
more than the

50
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,000
actual amount of gold.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,570
And this has been the
case even when we

52
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,680
were on the gold standard.

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,780
You had more dollars than you
actually had gold, but you had

54
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,650
to keep a little bit of gold
there just in case people

55
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,990
wanted to call your bluff.

56
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,720
In case X percentage of people
wanted their gold back.

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,360
So they would come back to
the central bank and

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,600
say, give us our gold.

59
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,320
But the gold fundamentally--
it had no other function.

60
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,000
It wasn't in the economy.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,250
It wasn't helping transactions
happen.

62
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,160
It wasn't doing anything.

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,310
It was just sitting in Fort Knox
or wherever it happens to

64
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,110
be sitting and to some degree,
it's more of a pain than any

65
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,520
kind of real value because you
have to keep up this notion

66
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,770
that these things, these
dollar bills, could be

67
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,000
translated into gold, it kind
of forced a reserve ratio

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,250
requirement on the central
bank itself.

69
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,130
And that reserve ratio
requirement-- if you think

70
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,990
about it, it's kind
of arbitrary.

71
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,970
It's dependent on how
much gold is found

72
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,430
in the world, right?

73
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,360
In order to increase the money
supply with GDP because people

74
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,000
are inventing computers and
railroads and cars and

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,980
highways are being built and
we're all becoming more

76
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,420
efficient-- in order to keep the
money supply up with that

77
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,655
extra economic activity, if we
stay on the gold standard and

78
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,090
if we want to keep these ratios
between the money and

79
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,630
gold, we'd have to grow our
gold with the economy.

80
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,440
And that's kind of arbitrary.

81
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,200
Maybe we'd find a big bunch of
gold or maybe we'd find no

82
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,680
gold-- and that really should
have no bearing on our

83
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,540
technological progress and
how hard we're working.

84
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,520
And it makes a lot of sense.

85
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,260
You could imagine in a world
where all of a sudden, an

86
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,790
asteroid made of gold lands in
the middle of the U.S., does

87
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,360
that all of a sudden-- because
gold is less valuable, should

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,810
that make the dollar
less cheap?

89
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,520
Or in another world where for
whatever reason we can't find

90
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,630
any more gold, should that all
of a sudden decrease our

91
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,430
ability to circulate
money around?

92
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,620
And when it becomes-- and I
said three videos ago that

93
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,380
these dollar bills aren't just
the liabilities or the

94
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,400
obligations of this
central bank.

95
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,460
They're actually obligations
of the U.S. government.

96
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,870
So let me ask you a question.

97
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,000
Would you rather have something
backed by gold or

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,270
backed by the U.S. government?

99
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,839
And I know many of you, your gut
reaction is to say, gold.

100
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,760
Gold is real value.

101
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,279
The U.S. government-- what
are they good for?

102
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,670
They're a bunch of crooks.

103
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,410
They lie, cheat, and steal.

104
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,520
They misallocate wealth
all the time.

105
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,870
But think about it.

106
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,170
Gold really isn't wealth.

107
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,300
It can be used to represent
wealth only because it's

108
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,070
pretty, only because
at some period--

109
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,320
and it doesn't corrode.

110
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,820
At some period in the past,
someone says, I'm willing to

111
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,460
plow your field if you give me
that cool rock that you found.

112
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,380
That's the only value
gold has.

113
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,430
It can't do work.

114
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,840
It can't be eaten.

115
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,350
It doesn't make us
more motivated.

116
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,580
It doesn't make us happier.

117
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,050
It's not real wealth.

118
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,380
   

119
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,870
Now what about the
U.S. government?

120
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,740
Well, it has the right,
the authority, to tax.

121
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,010
I know taxes are bad words and
I don't like them myself, but

122
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,850
it essentially-- can extract
these rents from the U.S.

123
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,260
economy, right?

124
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,680
Tax the U.S. economy.

125
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,620
And U.S. economy-- that's
real wealth.

126
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:26,970
That's labor, ideas,
land, resources.

127
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,340
Everything that makes us tick.

128
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,490
Our labor, our goods and
services, our ability to

129
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,970
educate ourselves, and innovate,
and come up with

130
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,010
technology, and become
more productive.

131
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,160
That's real wealth.

132
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,610
So if you really think about
it-- I know I'm getting a

133
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,700
little abstract here, but I
really want to hit this point

134
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,300
home because a lot of people,
I think, are still under the

135
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,130
notion that somehow something is
somehow tradeable for gold,

136
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,870
that it is of a sounder
currency, while if it's an

137
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,950
obligation of a government with
a very dynamic economy,

138
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,760
but not gold, it's somehow
backed by less wealth, but I'd

139
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,060
argue that this is
actually a more

140
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,960
profound amount of wealth.

141
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,600
I mean, we've had currencies in
ancient history that were

142
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,000
backed by gold, but
in a lot of cases,

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,210
you still had inflation.

144
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,595
When the Spanish currency in the
15th century was backed by

145
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:21,630
gold, but all of a sudden they
discover that Central America

146
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,520
had a lot of gold and you had
a ton of inflation and that

147
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,260
gold really didn't give any real
wealth to the Spaniards

148
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,680
of the time.

149
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,070
It just made everything more
expensive for them.

150
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,810
It did allow them to buy a
little bit more from other

151
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,540
countries, but it really didn't
create any innovation.

152
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,280
It didn't really make their pie
that bigger, except they

153
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,970
did steal some pie pieces from
other parts of the world-- but

154
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,260
we'll leave that
aside for now.

155
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,360
But this is real wealth-- a
currency backed by a whole

156
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,960
nation's ability to generate
wealth, in some ways, is a lot

157
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,070
more valuable.

158
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,400
But gold was a stepping stone
and it was necessary because

159
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,080
in order to get this whole thing
started and in order for

160
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,020
people to really have trust in
this currency, just the way

161
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,810
people are trained to think,
you had to originally sell

162
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,750
them on gold, right?

163
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,790
So if you think about it, gold
didn't play any role.

164
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,280
So in 1971, when Richard Nixon
decides to go off of the gold

165
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,370
standard, if-- and this is a
big if-- if you trust the

166
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,540
government's ability to manage
the money supply effectively,

167
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,660
that they're not going to print
so much money that we

168
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,750
have hyperinflation or they're
not going to print so little

169
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,670
money that we end up with
a deflationary spiral.

170
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,080
If you trust the government's
ability to do that, it really

171
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,930
doesn't matter that we went
off of the gold standard.

172
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,680
And it really just kind of gets
rid of a little nuisance.

173
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,205
And if you actually look at the
Federal Reserve's balance

174
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,720
sheet today, there still is
some gold sitting on their

175
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,640
balance sheet because it is
really not obvious what they

176
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,440
needed to do with it so
they just kept it.

177
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,460
Anyway, we'll we'll talk a lot
about this-- what is wealth

178
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,260
and what isn't wealth
in the future.

179
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,630
One example I often tell people
is-- let's say your

180
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:01,420
plane is going down-- you're the
pilot of a plane and it's

181
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,300
it's going down.

182
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,640
It's burning and you see two
islands in the horizon and you

183
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,760
have to ditch your plane on
one of those islands.

184
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,230
So one of those islands
it just has a big

185
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,480
pile of gold on it.

186
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,810
   

187
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,280
And then another island-- you
can see with your telescope

188
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,220
from the plane, it has cows on
it, it has-- I don't know--

189
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,290
all these random fruit
trees on it with

190
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,680
these luscious fruits.

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,500
You see-- I don't know-- it has
a big random pool of-- I

192
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,230
can't draw oil because oil
is black on a blackboard.

193
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,990
It has a pool of oil.

194
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,039
It has another big nice lake
of fresh water that's away

195
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,370
from the oil so it doesn't
get contaminated.

196
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,300
And you can see from your
telescope that it has a bunch

197
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,690
of hard working, innovative,
smart people on it who can-- I

198
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,500
don't know-- do all sorts
of interesting things.

199
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,950
They have roads and
they have horses.

200
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,160
They have all sorts of stuff.

201
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,010
Which island would you ditch
your plane on, assuming that

202
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,020
you'll never be able to get
back to civilization?

203
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,900
Well, the obvious answer is
you'd rather ditch your plane

204
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,870
on that island because that
island has more wealth.

205
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,370
And so when we went off of the
gold standard-- I know it

206
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,550
seems like this big horrible
thing in the whole scheme of

207
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,490
the world-- and gold has become
a lot more expensive.

208
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,120
It's no longer $35 an ounce.

209
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,790
It's whatever-- $700 or
$800 an ounce now.

210
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,410
So you might think, there's
been all this inflation.

211
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,160
It would've been great if we
were on the gold standard.

212
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,600
But think about what's
happened since 1971.

213
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,730
Other than some of this excess
credit that was given out

214
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,160
maybe over the last 10 or 15
years-- other than these

215
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,600
bubbles, we've seen a
tremendous amount of

216
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,360
innovation and we haven't seen
hyperinflation and that's all

217
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,590
in the world of-- you can call
it a fiat currency, a currency

218
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,810
that's not backed by any
kind of hard asset.

219
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,800
It's backed by people's trust
in the ability of the U.S.

220
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,560
economy to support debt
to pay off the

221
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,190
value of this currency.

222
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,590
We'll talk more about
that in the future.

223
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,920
I don't want to get too circular
in my conversations.

224
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,930
But I'll see you in
the next video.

225
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,050
I just wanted to touch on that
point that we are now off the

226
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,560
gold standard.

227
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:11,900
