1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,900
I think you'll find this video
exciting because until now,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,420
we've just been talking about
the Federal reserve in the

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,950
abstract and I was drawing
little boxes to represent

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,830
balance sheets, but this is
the actual Federal reserve

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,510
balance sheet and I took a date
that was before all of

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,390
this silliness started happening
in the banking

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,340
sector just so we could kind of
see what a Federal reserve

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,660
balance would've looked like
in a normal environment.

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,780
And then we can actually, in
future videos, compare what

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,580
they've done since then and
then we can get a better

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,500
insight into all of the
different machinations that

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,370
the Federal reserve has done to
kind of try to keep banks

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,900
liquid and solvent and to
keep everything going.

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,320
And we can debate whether
they've been good or bad or

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,260
they're just keeping banks
in kind of zombie mode.

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,225
But anyway, this is the Federal
reserve's balance

18
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:48,200
sheet as of February
14th, 2007.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,140
So before all the craziness
happened, although a little

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,530
bit started-- this is before the
Feds started taking really

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,350
aggressive action to provide
liquidity for the markets.

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,000
But here the assets.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,900
So first of all, we have the
total assets number.

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,410
That's just interesting
to look at.

25
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,240
These are all in millions.

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,660
So this is $871 billion
of assets.

27
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,910
Let's just get the
big picture.

28
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,620
   

29
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,830
Let me draw that here in our
traditional box diagram.

30
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:23,020
So if I were to draw the
assets-- the sum of all the

31
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:30,160
assets over here is $871
billion, and we know that the

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,715
liabilities plus equity better
add up to $871 billion.

33
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:34,280
Let's see.

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,540
What's the total liabilities?

35
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,800
Total liabilities is
$839 billion-- so

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,260
give or take $840.

37
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,720
So the liabilities-- I'll do
it in a different color.

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,420
The liabilities are $840
billion, give or

39
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,940
take a little bit.

40
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,540
They should have the same width,
not that the width

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,790
matters that much.

42
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:04,080
   

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,360
And then whatever's left over
should be equity, right?

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,400
Assets minus liabilities.

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,690
What you have minus what you owe
is what you're left with

46
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,130
for the owners.

47
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,130
And of course, owners of the
Federal reserve, you kind of

48
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,620
have to take with
a grain of salt.

49
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,620
They really don't have the
upside of traditional owners.

50
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,480
They're really just kind
of stakeholders.

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,060
What's left over
is the equity.

52
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,220
It should be roughly
$31 billion.

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,790
And let's confirm that
by looking at the

54
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,330
actual balance sheet.

55
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,890
And here we have it-- total
capital is $31 billion.

56
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,310
So big picture, so far it's kind
of meeting up with how

57
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,770
we've envisioned a Federal
reserve balance sheet, but

58
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,170
let's dig a little deeper and
see if we can find interesting

59
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,740
things and things we've
talked about.

60
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,480
And hopefully at this point,
we should actually

61
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,830
understand all of it.

62
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,450
Let's focus on the
assets for now.

63
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,160
So the assets are just
this part of it.

64
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,670
OK.

65
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,580
So it has-- this is what?

66
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,820
This is $11 billion of gold
certificate accounts and

67
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,000
that's some type of
rights on gold.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,220
Let's see.

69
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,380
Gold certificate accounts.

70
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,960
Let's see if they have any
other gold anywhere.

71
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,660
Coin-- $1 billion.

72
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,570
But this is all small
potatoes, right?

73
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,620
I don't know what special
drawing rights certificate

74
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,750
account is, but it's very
small relative to

75
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,630
the big pie, right?

76
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,830
There's $871 billion
of assets.

77
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,310
This is just kind of almost
rounding-off error.

78
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,690
Here we have a big chunk
of something.

79
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,750
Actually, I think this $11
billion is actual gold because

80
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,860
I don't see it anywhere
else on their assets.

81
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,300
So I think if you combine
roughly-- I don't know what

82
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,680
this thing here is, but if you
combine this and this, it's

83
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,920
saying that the Federal reserve
is-- because I don't

84
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,100
see gold anywhere else here--
that it's holding roughly $12

85
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,360
billion worth of gold, which
really isn't a lot of gold

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,670
when you consider the total
size of its balance sheet.

87
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,070
The big piece right here-- let
me pick a different color.

88
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,700
I'll do it in the purple.

89
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:04,030
It has securities, repurchase
agreements, and loans-- $808

90
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,090
billion-- almost $809 billion.

91
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,060
So this is a big piece of
the Fed's balance sheet.

92
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,760
Out of the whole $871, $808.

93
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,149
So pretty much it's almost
like that much of it.

94
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,100
Actually, maybe a little bit
less of that-- are these

95
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,459
securities and things
like that.

96
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,540
Let's see what kind of
securities they have. And they

97
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,340
break them down.

98
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:31,090
So this $808 billion is made up
of these things right here.

99
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,340
The bulk of them are U.S.
treasury loans, right?

100
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,140
So these are going to be bills,
notes, and bonds-- OK.

101
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,620
So just to explain, a treasury
bill-- and I've done videos on

102
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,820
this-- this is essentially a
loan to the government for a

103
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,040
year or less.

104
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,760
So it's just a loan to the
government that matures in a

105
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,570
year or in three months.

106
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,560
Notes and bonds-- these are
loans to the U.S. treasury

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,820
that have longer maturities.

108
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,430
Notes are up to 10 years.

109
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,650
Bonds are more than 10 years.

110
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,833
And then inflation index bonds--
I'll do a whole video

111
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,490
on that in the future, but
these are essentially

112
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,250
treasuries that are indexed to
inflation so you can kind of

113
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,770
hedge out a little bit of
your inflation risk.

114
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,770
But, needless to say, the big
picture is is that $780

115
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,970
billion of the Fed's assets are
treasuries, loans to the

116
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:15,790
Federal government.

117
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,710
Let me draw that here.

118
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,420
So a pretty big piece, roughly
that much is treasury.

119
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,060
So most of what the Federal
reserve owns are treasuries.

120
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,040
And that's consistent with
everything we've gone over so

121
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,960
far and that account for
everything up to here.

122
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,740
And then what's interesting--
what we just talked about--

123
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,580
repurchase agreements,
$30 billion.

124
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,940
And I don't know 100%, but I'm
guessing that these are--

125
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,270
someone came to the discount
window and essentially

126
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,480
borrowed $30 billion
from the Fed-- and

127
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,290
it's not just someone.

128
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,780
It's probably multiple people
came and borrowed $30 billion

129
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,890
from the Fed-- and they gave
treasuries as collateral, but

130
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,355
as we know, just the way
repurchase agreements work,

131
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,330
they actually kind of sold the
treasuries to the Fed and the

132
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,920
Fed agreed to buy it later,
but it's essentially

133
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,880
collateral.

134
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,180
So these repurchase agreements--
they're included

135
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,090
in these securities because
they're not

136
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,010
just agreements, right?

137
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,770
They actually are-- they're
probably treasuries or they

138
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,070
might be other types of highly
rated securities and we'll

139
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,700
learn in future videos that
the Fed has lowered its

140
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,900
standards over the last year
in terms of what type of

141
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,030
collateral or what type of
securities it's willing to

142
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,530
trade in these repurchase
agreements, but in the

143
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,590
situation it looks like
about $30 billion.

144
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,400
And you can also-- you get
a clue of what repurchase

145
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,820
agreements are because here,
they say securities held

146
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,000
outright, right?

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,030
So there's no repurchase
agreement.

148
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,660
There's not some contract where
they say they're going

149
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,370
to sell this to someone
else at another price.

150
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,740
These are repurchase
agreements.

151
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,900
These are kind of more
collateral for loans.

152
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,650
And then they have outright
loans-- $39 million.

153
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,040
That's pretty much peanuts in
the Federal reserve world.

154
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,420
So the bulk is treasuries, a
little bit of repurchase

155
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,940
agreements, and then there's
other assets.

156
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,090
They don't break out
what this is.

157
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,250
Maybe there's some
gold in that.

158
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,620
I'm not sure.

159
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,800
Bank premises, the buildings
of the Federal reserve are

160
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,810
worth $2 billion.

161
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,970
I mean, they have 12 banks
around the country and I'm

162
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,770
sure they have a bunch
of other things.

163
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,820
And then items in process
collection.

164
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,030
I don't know what these
things are, but these

165
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,940
are all small potatoes.

166
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,600
The big thing is that the
Federal reserve's assets are

167
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,470
predominantly U.S. treasuries--
at least, they're

168
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,700
predominantly treasuries
right now.

169
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,360
Now let's look at
the liabilities.

170
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,010
And to some degree, this is
much more interesting.

171
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,220
So Federal reserve notes,
net of Federal

172
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,830
reserve bank holdings.

173
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,460
   

174
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,400
So $769 billion.

175
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,540
So when I talked about
notes outstanding,

176
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,820
that's what this is.

177
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,620
These are Federal reserve notes
that have been printed

178
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,950
and they're liabilities,
right?

179
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,670
Because the Federal reserve bank
printed these notes and

180
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,000
then used them as currency and
so they're liabilities now

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,830
because someone can come back
another time and say, hey,

182
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,220
give me back the value of these
things and that's a bit

183
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,880
of an abstract concept, but
roughly $700 something of this

184
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,020
are notes outstanding.

185
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,040
This is money that the Federal
reserve had printed.

186
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,880
And then there's some reverse
repurchase agreements, which

187
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,310
essentially-- see for some
reason, the Federal reserve

188
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,850
used repurchase agreements to
borrow from someone else.

189
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,840
It has a little bit of
deposits, right?

190
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,370
And these deposits have actually
grown dramatically in

191
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,080
the past year.

192
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,730
Has $22 billion of deposits.

193
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,630
So these are actually deposits
that banks are keeping with

194
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,320
the Federal reserve.

195
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,090
The U.S. treasury actually
keeps some money there.

196
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,390
Depository institutions have
$17 billion-- and actually,

197
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,480
that's how the Federal
reserve traditionally

198
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,360
has paid its expenses.

199
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,490
People put deposits with the
Federal reserve-- so let's say

200
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,750
these are deposits from banks.

201
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,230
It's a very small piece.

202
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,960
It's like $17 billion.

203
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,070
These could be deposits from
member banks, but the Federal

204
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,770
reserve does not pay interest
in these deposits.

205
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,000
They don't pay interest on these
deposits and then they

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,290
can take these deposits and by
treasuries or other securities

207
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,630
and get interest on them.

208
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,740
So they're essentially getting
free interest and that's what

209
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,030
they used actually to fund
their operations.

210
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,750
Any excess after funding their
operations goes back to the

211
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,420
U.S. Treasury so it's not like
Ben Bernanke can fly around or

212
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,450
drive a Bentley or something.

213
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,820
And then I don't know what this
is-- foreign official--

214
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,880
these are nothing items. So the
bulk of it is money that

215
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,050
had been printed and that's
a liability of the Federal

216
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,020
reserve now.

217
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,980
And then there's a little bit
of deposits from depository

218
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,850
institutions.

219
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,520
And the treasury has kept
some money with the

220
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,030
Federal reserve as well.

221
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,660
And then everything left
over is the equity.

222
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,880
Anyway, I thought that would be
pretty neat to see that you

223
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,910
can actually look at what the
Federal reserve's balance

224
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,520
sheet is right now.

225
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,870
You can actually just do
a web search for it.

226
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,790
You'll find it in a bunch
of different sources.

227
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,420
And you can actually
analyze it.

228
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,790
You now have the tools to look
at that and make sense of it.

229
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,970
And what's even more interesting
is to compare this

230
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,730
balance sheet with the current
Federal reserve balance sheet

231
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,960
and then you can know
everything that

232
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,860
they've been up to.

233
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,000
