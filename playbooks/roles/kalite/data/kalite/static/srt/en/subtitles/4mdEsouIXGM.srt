1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:03,370
Once upon a time there was a small world.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,173
It was a flat world, and it wasn't very wide,

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,942
in fact it was so thin that if you weren't careful,

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,478
you might fall right off the edge.

5
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:16,201
In this world was a house, and in this house lived a triangle.

6
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:18,103
Her name was Wind.

7
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,973
Wind lived all alone and was sometimes sad about that.

8
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:26,478
But she wasn't too lonely because she had a friend that lived just one house over.

9
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:28,346
His name was Mr.ug.

10
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:31,367
Wind often went to visit Mr.ug.

11
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:36,138
She'd walk past the biG rocK, and the PInE Log, and the BEEt PEEl store,

12
00:00:36,138 --> 00:00:37,807
though she'd never seen it open.

13
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:41,202
Until she got to Mr.ug's little yellow house.

14
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:45,956
The problem with Mr.ug was that he never seemed to be home.

15
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:49,136
So Wind did what she always did and left him a message,

16
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,672
so that he'd know that she'd been there.

17
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,874
"HI Mr.ug," she wrote.

18
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:57,011
She hung around a little longer, hoping he might come home soon.

19
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:59,680
But eventually she gave up and walked back home.

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,036
past the BEEt PEEl sotre, the PInE Log, and the biG rocK, to her own little house.

21
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:08,340
When she got back, she saw that someone had left her a message.

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,374
It said: "HI wind."

23
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:13,678
Mr.ug must have come by to see her while she was out trying to see him.

24
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:16,748
She kicked herself for waiting around so long at his house,

25
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:19,869
maybe if she'd gotten back sooner, she could have caught him while he was still there.

26
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,872
She erased the message and decided to go back to his place,

27
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:25,008
since he was obviously heading back there as well.

28
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,443
Their timing always seemed to be wrong.

29
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:31,014
Whenever she went to see him, he seemed to be out visiting her,

30
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:33,367
in fact, she'd never actually met Mr.ug,

31
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:34,935
but she felt like she knew him very well,

32
00:01:34,935 --> 00:01:37,705
because of the messages they were always leaving each other.

33
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:39,406
When she got to his place,

34
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:42,910
she saw that he had already read her message, erased it, and left again.

35
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:45,346
But Wind was used to this kind of coincidence.

36
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:48,697
So she simply continued their conversation by leaving another message.

37
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:52,437
"how r u, rite now" she asked, and turned around to go home.

38
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:55,207
Her grammar and spelling weren't so good.

39
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:57,676
Because after all, there was no school in her little world.

40
00:01:57,676 --> 00:02:01,046
Mr.ug didn't always have perfect spelling either.

41
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:03,949
But Wind thought that he had a lovely way with words.

42
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,673
For example, when she got home,

43
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:08,838
she found that Mr.ug had already written a reply to her "how are you"

44
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:12,041
he'd said: "Nom, n' lifE Nom."

45
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,577
She thought this was a beautiful metaphor,

46
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:18,781
and felt lucky to have a neighbor who would never answer "how are you" with something boring like

47
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:20,401
"fine, thank you"

48
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,004
But what she really wanted, more than anything,

49
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:27,341
was to actually meet him, see his face for the first time.

50
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:29,543
She decided to try another tactic.

51
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,679
She erased his note, and left one saying:

52
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,646
"BACK sooN"

53
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:35,467
This way, if Mr.ug came to visit while she was out,

54
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:38,604
he'd know to stay around for a while until she got back.

55
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:41,340
The prospect of finally meeting him,

56
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,111
made Wind feel nervous and self conscious about how boring her messages always were compared to his.

57
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:48,814
So she decided to get artistic, and illustrate it,

58
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:50,900
by drawing a foot with wings on the heel.

59
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,069
She then rushed back to Mr.ug's house

60
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,340
with all the swiftness of Hermes to find that indeed he was once again not there.

61
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,509
Though it seemed he had taken up a new project,

62
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:05,281
as there was a sign up for a BUCK Zooh, complete with picture of a fully antlered buck.

63
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:07,935
Maybe he was out collecting deer for his zoo,

64
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:14,141
but maybe, just maybe he had gone to visit her and saw her sign, and decided to wait until she got back,

65
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:16,477
So she dashed out a quick "HEllo LEAVInG"

66
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:20,915
and then rushed back to her house, with all the swiftness of Mercury.

67
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:26,405
She approached her house, anticipating finally saying hello to Mr.ug in real life for the first time,

68
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:30,009
but found only a message that said "rEVAlUe HEllO."

69
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,045
It was an interesting message, and gave her something to ponder,

70
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:37,067
maybe she was spending too much time trying to greet and talk to Mr.ug

71
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,835
and not enough time on her own projects.

72
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:42,172
She thought about how often they seemed to cross paths,

73
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:46,109
and yet, she had never actually passed him on the path between their houses...

74
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,745
maybe there was another path he used...

75
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,414
wind had never explored the world to the left of her house,

76
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:56,037
but maybe it was about time she stopped obsessing over Mr.ug and went on an adventure~

77
00:03:56,037 --> 00:04:00,942
Maybe, while Mr.ug worked on his Buck Zoo, she could have a project of her own,

78
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,677
and work on exploring the world,

79
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:06,147
So she went left, and discovered a few new places.

80
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:09,268
There was a store which sold BEEf and bEEr,

81
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:12,004
though unfortunately it seemed to have closed long ago,

82
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:16,742
and a blUE rod, and a LocK pIe, which didn't sound too appetising to her...

83
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:20,112
Before long however, she found herself somewhere familiar,

84
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:24,701
she was back at Mr.ug's house, and as usual, he was not home.

85
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:28,171
But now she knew why they kept missing each other,

86
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:32,876
their little world was a loop, and they were taking different paths from one side to the other.

87
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:37,647
wind was very excited by this discovery, because now she understood her world a little better.

88
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:42,837
Best of all, in such a small world, her and Mr.ug were bound to meet eventually.

89
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:45,907
So she went home and decided to start another project,

90
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:49,911
sometimes she worried that one of them would accidently fall off the edge of the world,

91
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:52,413
and she would never get to meet Mr.ug,

92
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:55,901
after all, she herself had fallen off the flat land where she grew up,

93
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,070
which was how she'd gotten here

94
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,072
She'd thought about building a fence along the edge,

95
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:02,208
but it had always seemed like too big a project.

96
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,443
Now that she knew that her world was a loop,

97
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:07,346
she realised she could actually finish this project,

98
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:09,949
and build a fence around the entire world.

99
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:15,236
She started with the side below her house, and started around towards Mr.ug's.

100
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:21,106
She passed the biG rocK, and the pInE Log, and the BEEt PEEL store, until she got to Mr.ug's little yellow house

101
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:24,147
her heart fluttering that he might be home this time~

102
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:29,004
But she saw to her surprise, that Mr.ug was building a fence of his own on the other edge of the world.

103
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:32,707
Maybe he had gone to visit her and saw the beginnings of her fence,

104
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,875
and decided to help out.

105
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,777
wind continued building her fence,

106
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:39,381
thinking how sweet it was that Mr.ug was helping with her project.

107
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:44,003
She passed the LocK pie, and the blUE rod, and the BEEf and bEEr store,

108
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:45,705
and when she got back to her home,

109
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:49,408
she was pleased to see that her entire world was safe,

110
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:52,545
and she only had to build a fence along one edge of it.

111
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:55,281
Secure in the knowledge that Mr.ug wasn't going anywhere,

112
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:58,335
wind started perusing other projects in the following days,

113
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:02,373
for example, she got a pet dog, which helped her feel a bit less lonely,

114
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:04,456
and built it a dog house.

115
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:08,278
She still wandered over to Mr.ug's place on occasion, just to see how he was doing.

116
00:06:08,278 --> 00:06:10,091
It seemed that recently he'd gotten religious,

117
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:12,601
because he build what appeared to be a small church.

118
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:17,272
One day, wind was out watching her dog, when the ground started to shake.

119
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:19,841
Suddenly the ground began to split.

120
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:24,546
It was an earthquake, so powerful that it was ripping her world apart !

121
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:28,835
wind quickly got away from the dangerous new edge that was being torn through her world

122
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:30,937
but her dog was still on the other side~

123
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:32,905
She ran trying to get past the crack,

124
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:36,109
but the world was splitting right down the centre, all the way around.

125
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:37,910
She could still hear her dog barking,

126
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,306
but the sound faded as the two sides of her world separated,

127
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,844
and drifted apart.

128
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:44,602
Would she ever see her dog again?

129
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,969
and what about Mr.ug?

130
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:50,374
I hate to end on a cliffhanger, but luckily for you,

131
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:52,543
you can figure out the ending to the this story yourself.

132
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:55,412
wind lives on not just any loop, but a Möbius strip

133
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:57,448
Which you can make easily out of paper.

134
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:58,500
Just cut out a strip,

135
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,801
and instead of taping it into a normal loop,

136
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:01,536
give it a half twist first.

137
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:03,972
If you use a marker that bleeds through the paper,

138
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:05,841
you can draw wind's house and see it from the other side

139
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:08,677
but all that's essential here is that you draw wind and her dog.

140
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:12,014
Cut a line down the centre of the paper all the way around,

141
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,531
and you tell me how it ends...
