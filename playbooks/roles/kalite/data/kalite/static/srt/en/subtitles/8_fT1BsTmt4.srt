1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:07,826
We have 7329 - 6278.

2
00:00:07,826 --> 00:00:09,225
So let's go place by place,

3
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,333
and see if we can subtract.

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:15,312
6278 is clearly less than 7329,

5
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:17,180
so we should be able to do this.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,676
So, first we go to the ones place.

7
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:21,012
We're subtracting an 8 from a 9.

8
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:22,504
That seems pretty straightforward.

9
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:23,905
That's just going to be a 1–

10
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:25,167
a 1 in the 1's place.

11
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:26,997
It literally just represents 1.

12
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:28,504
Then we go to the the 10's place.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,004
And we’re trying to subtract a 7 from a 2.

14
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,489
And this is really representing 70.

15
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,847
And this is really representing 20.

16
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:37,110
Well now, we’re hitting a bit of a stumbling block.

17
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,719
So we’re going to have to regroup or borrow.

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,336
And to understand what we're doing,

19
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:44,269
let’s rewrite both of these numbers.

20
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:47,290
So 7329.

21
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,585
7, we can rewrite as being equal to 7000.

22
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,851
... plus 300.

23
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:58,258
So this 3 in the 100's place is representing 300.

24
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,486
The 7 in the 1,000's place is 7000.

25
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:03,330
The 3 in the 100's place is 300.

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,801
The 2 in the 10's place, that’s 2 10’s, or 20.

27
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,022
And then the 9 in the 1's place

28
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:12,275
is just going to be 9.

29
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:16,362
So this is another way of representing 7329.

30
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:18,705
And then down here, we have the 6

31
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:20,218
in the 1000's place.

32
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:22,147
Well that's going to be 6000.

33
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:25,817
We’re subtracting. So minus 6000.

34
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:28,827
And then here, we have a 2 in the 100's place.

35
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:29,851
And once again, we are going to be

36
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:31,168
subtracting all of these.

37
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:34,072
So we're going to be subtracting 200.

38
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:38,411
And then here in the 10's place, we have our 7 –

39
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:39,109
and we're subtracting it.

40
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:41,716
So 7 10's, that's 70.

41
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:43,091
And then we have –

42
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:46,689
We're subtracting that 8.

43
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:50,962
And what we've already done is we've said,

44
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:53,443
"Hey, look. Subtracting 8 from 9?

45
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:56,723
That’s just going to be 1.”

46
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:58,142
But then we got over here and we said,

47
00:01:58,142 --> 00:02:01,679
“Hey! How are we going to subtract 70 from 20?”

48
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:03,001
And the key here is to regroup

49
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,476
some of the value up here,

50
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:05,645
and give it to the 10's place,

51
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:08,137
so that we can then subtract 70 from it.

52
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,574
And the most natural place to go

53
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:11,965
is one place value above.

54
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,388
So we could take 100 from the 300 –

55
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:18,670
so we could take 100 from the 300.

56
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,896
So then it will become 200.

57
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:23,834
We're going to give 100 to –

58
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,142
We are going to give that 100 to the 10's place.

59
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:31,532
So it is going to become 120.

60
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:35,190
Notice, 200 + 120 is 320.

61
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,410
300 + 20 is 320.

62
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,321
We have not changed the value of the number.

63
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:40,904
We've just changed what place

64
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:42,458
we're representing it in.

65
00:02:42,473 --> 00:02:44,674
If we wanted to do it here, we could say –

66
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:46,132
And this is kind of the –

67
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,239
When you think of it this way,

68
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:48,344
this is really regrouping --

69
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:49,820
and this is really what's happening.

70
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,659
But if you want to think of it

71
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:51,917
in a borrowing framework,

72
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:55,192
you could say, “Hey let's take 1 from the 3 –

73
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:57,685
Although that’s a 300. So you’re really taking 100.

74
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,172
That becomes a 2.

75
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:01,613
And you give that 1 to the 10's place.

76
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:05,124
And so that becomes a 12.

77
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:07,761
Now, what was really happening is you took 100,

78
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:10,163
and you gave it to the 20, so it became 120.

79
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:11,341
But now you can subtract.

80
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:14,430
Here, you’d say, "Well, what’s 120 - 70?"

81
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,989
Well, 120 - 70 is going to be 50.

82
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,711
Over here you could say, “Well what's 12 - 7?”

83
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:22,177
Well that's 5.

84
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:23,932
But it’s still representing the same thing.

85
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,719
12 10's is 120.

86
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,638
7 10's is 70.

87
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:29,495
And they give you 5 10's –

88
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:30,896
which is the same thing as 50.

89
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:33,427
This 5 represents that 50.

90
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,067
And then we can go to the other places.

91
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:38,009
You say 2 - 2. Well that's 0 100's.

92
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:42,178
And then 7000 - 6000 is 1000.

93
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,655
And once again, right over here,

94
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:47,719
200 - 200 is 0 100's.

95
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:52,713
And then 7000 - 6000 is 1000.

96
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:56,345
So this is going to be 1000 + 000 + 50 + 1 ...

97
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:59,769
which is the exact same thing as 1051.

98
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,085
The important thing is to visualize –

99
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:02,729
You don't have to write this out every time.

100
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:03,991
But [the important thing is] to make sure you visualize

101
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:06,670
in your head that this 3 is representing 300 –

102
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,490
that this 2 represents 20 –

103
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,640
that when you're taking 100 from the 300,

104
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,342
then you'd represent that as a 2

105
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:14,566
in the 100's place.

106
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:16,748
And then when you give a 100 to the 10's place,

107
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,533
it's essentially like adding –

108
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:22,448
it's essentially that the 2 10's will become 12 10's

109
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:23,940
– because you're giving it 10 more 10's.

110
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,256
You’re giving it a 100.

111
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:27,445
So hopefully that makes some sense.
