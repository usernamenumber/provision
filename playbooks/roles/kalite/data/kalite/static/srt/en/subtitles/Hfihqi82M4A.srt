1
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,529
All right, we're on problem number 8.

2
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:03,255
They ask us

3
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:10,758
which equation is equivalent 5x-2(7x+1)＝14x

4
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:12,984
So I'm guessing they just want to simplify this a little bit

5
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:14,615
and see if we get to one of these choices.

6
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:15,428
So let's do that.

7
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:25,051
So we start with 5x-2(7x+1)＝14x

8
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,334
This is I think the most obvious thing to simplify.

9
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:34,634
This 2(7x+1) or we can even say -2(7x+1)

10
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:38,316
so then this becomes 5x plus

11
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:41,079
I'm just going to distribute the -2 times all of this.

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:48,215
Plus -2 times 17x is minus 14x.

13
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,612
minus 14x

14
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:56,133
And then -2 times 1 is minus 2 is equal to 14x.

15
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,791
And let's see, on all of these choices

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,297
they have 14x on the right hand side.

17
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:00,464
So they just want us to simplify this.

18
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:07,042
So this simplifies to 5x, plus -14, so that's -14x

19
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:10,131
minus 2 is equal to 14x.

20
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:12,228
So we have 5x-14x.

21
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:14,523
What's 5-14?

22
00:01:14,523 --> 00:01:16,825
It's what? -9, right?

23
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:23,339
-9x-2＝14x

24
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:26,006
That is choice A.

25
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:27,830
Now, one thing that maybe I realized,

26
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:29,192
I kind of skipped a step.

27
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:30,769
We could've just...

28
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:32,207
Let me just do this

29
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:34,852
just so that you understand this step that I did here.

30
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:36,057
We could have just said minus

31
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:37,330
and then distribute the 2

32
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,081
So we could have right there said

33
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:48,884
5x minus positive 2 times 7x, 14x, plus 2 times
1, plus 2.

34
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:50,051
I'm just doing the left-hand side.

35
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:52,255
And then we could have distributed the minus sign.

36
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:57,021
So you get 5x-14x-2.

37
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:59,655
Either way, it would have gotten us to this point and then

38
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:03,165
we could have simplified here and gotten choice A.

39
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,419
Next problem.

40
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:07,577
Which equation is equivalent to

41
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,010
OK, so another case where

42
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,136
I'm guessing they just want us

43
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:14,098
to simplify these equations

44
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:16,107
So let me write that down.

45
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:26,846
4(2-5x)＝6-3(1-3x)

46
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,960
All right, let's distribute this 4 first.

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,277
So you get 4 times 2 is 8.

48
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:36,597
4 times -5x is -20x.

49
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:41,055
-20x is equal to 6 minus--

50
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:42,826
maybe you might have been tempted to say,

51
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:44,952
oh, 6 minus 3, that's 3, and then distribute it.

52
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:46,241
Remember, order of operations.

53
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:48,775
Multiplication comes first.

54
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:51,725
So we have to multiply the 3(1-3x)

55
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:53,713
before we can deal with the 6.

56
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:54,569
Well, on the other side

57
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:56,534
there was just the multiplication first.

58
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:57,713
All right.

59
00:02:57,713 --> 00:03:03,252
So here, 3(1-3x), so it'll be 3.

60
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:04,469
I'm just going to do

61
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,480
minus a positive 3 times each of these.

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,222
So 3 times a -3 is -9x.

63
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:13,079
And now I can distribute this minus sign.

64
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,629
So let's see, on the left-hand side I have

65
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,138
let me do it in a brighter color.

66
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:22,758
The left-hand side I have 8-20x＝ 6,

67
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:24,535
and then I'm going to subtract this whole thing.

68
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:25,745
So you can view it as

69
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:28,003
distributing a -1 times both of these.

70
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:33,147
So 6 plus -3, or just 6-3,

71
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:37,707
and then a minus times a minus plus 9x.

72
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:39,823
All right.

73
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:42,678
Now let's see what we could do to help simplify this.

74
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:45,908
What happens if we add 20x to both sides?

75
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,635
Then on the left-hand side, it goes away

76
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:51,500
so we're just left with 8 is equal to

77
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,337
well,let me just do that.

78
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,987
6 minus 3.

79
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:58,242
I added 20x, so plus 29x.

80
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:00,786
I really should have simplified this 6 minus 3

81
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:02,008
but I didn't want to do too much in one step.

82
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:06,608
So 8＝3+29x,

83
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:11,117
and then if we subtract 3 from both sides here

84
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,608
we get 8 minus 3 is 5.

85
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:15,974
That 3 goes away and you get 29x

86
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:20,068
and that is choice C. 29x＝5.

87
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:25,852
Next question, problem number 10.

88
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,577
And I should be careful that you don't think that

89
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:30,413
all of this stuff is for this problem.

90
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:32,255
The total cost, c, in dollars

91
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:34,318
of renting a sailboat for n days

92
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:37,118
is given by this equation.

93
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:40,228
If the total cost was $360

94
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,858
for how many days was the sailboat rented?

95
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:45,964
So they're giving us c. c is $360.

96
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:50,235
So they're telling us that $360, that's the total cost,

97
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:51,288
and that's going to be equal to

98
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:57,352
120 plus 60 times the total days rented, times 60n.

99
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:59,081
And that's what they want us to figure out, n.

100
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:02,688
How many days was the sailboat rented?

101
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,752
Let's see, so if you should subtract 120

102
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,713
from both sides of this equation

103
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:11,518
you get 240 is equal to 60n.

104
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:12,633
I'll go here.

105
00:05:12,822 --> 00:05:15,681
And if you divide both sides of this by 60

106
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,439
240 divided by 60

107
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,746
that's the same thing as 24 divided by 6

108
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:21,410
so that's 4.

109
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,917
And then 60n divided by 60 is, of course, 1

110
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,470
so that is n.

111
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,593
So the sailboat was rented for 4 days.

112
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:34,160
All right, problem number 11.

113
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,505
And I cut and pasted part of it

114
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:40,321
but they want us to determine

115
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:42,468
what was the first incorrect step

116
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,372
that they did in this problem?

117
00:05:43,372 --> 00:05:45,131
So let's see if we can determine that.

118
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:45,642
So let's see.

119
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:49,560
Solve 3(x+5)＝2x+35

120
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,452
Fair enough.

121
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:54,818
So in this first step they distributed 3*x 3x5

122
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:57,067
Right, 3x+15＝2x+35

123
00:05:57,067 --> 00:06:00,634
so step 1 looks good to me.

124
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:02,531
Let me do that in a darker color.

125
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:03,618
Step 1 looks good.

126
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:05,422
They distributed the 3.

127
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:08,476
Now let's see what they did in step 2.

128
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:10,526
Let's see, if I wanted to solve this

129
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:12,583
I would subtract 2x from both sides,

130
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,181
and it looks like that's what they attempted to do

131
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:17,913
because they got rid of this 2x, right?

132
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:18,569
On the right-hand side

133
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:22,245
they went from 2x+35 to just 35

134
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:24,013
so somehow they got rid of this 2x

135
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:25,052
and the only way to get rid of it

136
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,142
is to subtract 2x from both sides.

137
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:31,282
Right? Subtract 2x from both sides

138
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,508
Now, if I subtract 2x from both sides, sure enough

139
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:36,160
the right-hand side will just be left with the 35.

140
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,376
The left-hand side will have the 15, of course.

141
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:44,454
And then I have -2x+3x.

142
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,532
Well, -2x+3x, that's x.

143
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,438
So this 5x, that shouldn't be there.

144
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:51,929
It should be x+15＝35.

145
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:55,392
So even though they were trying to get rid of this 2x

146
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:57,323
and they should have subtracted 2x from both sides

147
00:06:57,327 --> 00:06:59,141
they inadvertently added 2x here

148
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:01,355
so they said 2x+3x＝5x.

149
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,459
Well, that was wrong.

150
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:03,185
You have to subtract.

151
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:05,698
And you're just left with x+15 ＝35.

152
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:09,963
So step 2 is when they made their first error.

153
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,579
Problem 120.

154
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,798
120

155
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:21,255
A 120-foot-long rope is cut into 3 pieces.

156
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:23,172
The first piece of the rope let me draw.

157
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:27,461
This is begging for a diagram.

158
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:30,793
All right, so they say the first piece of rope

159
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:34,778
is twice as long as the second piece of rope.

160
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:36,751
Ok, and then they say the third piece of rope

161
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:39,433
is three times as long as the second piece of rope.

162
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:43,119
Everything is a multiple of the second piece of rope.

163
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:46,474
So the second one was the shortest one

164
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:47,356
just reading it, right?

165
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:49,569
The first is twice as long as the second.

166
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,262
The third is three times as long.

167
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,602
So if I just drew it.

168
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,796
So if this is the second length of rope,

169
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:00,672
let's call that x.

170
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,044
That's the second length of rope.

171
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:06,222
And they told us the first piece of rope

172
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:10,038
the first piece of rope is twice as long

173
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:11,950
as the second piece of rope.

174
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,983
OK, so if this is the first piece of rope right here

175
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:17,270
it's going to be twice as long as the second piece of rope.

176
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,874
So that's 2x.

177
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:19,634
Fair enough.

178
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:21,413
And then they tell us

179
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:22,605
I'll do this in magenta

180
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:26,486
The third piece of rope is three times as long

181
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,650
as the second piece of rope.

182
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,813
So this is the third piece of rope here.

183
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:33,535
It's three times as long as the second piece of rope.

184
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,417
So it's 3x.

185
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,488
And they say, what is the length

186
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:40,601
of the longest piece of rope?

187
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:42,351
All right, so let's think about it.

188
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:45,579
If I add up all of these segments, right

189
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:46,560
what do they add up to?

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,680
Well, they tell us that it's 120-foot-long rope.

191
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,236
So let me add that up.

192
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:56,818
So if I do 2x plus x plus 3x

193
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:59,532
that's going to equal 120 feet.

194
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:01,665
That is equal to 120 feet, right

195
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:04,917
That whole distance is 120.

196
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,689
So 2x plus x is 3x plus 3x

197
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:11,337
you get 6x is equal to 120

198
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:14,282
You divide both sides by 6

199
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:17,645
You get x is 120 divided by 6 is 20.

200
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:19,165
All right, that's what x is.

201
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,661
That's the second piece of rope

202
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,020
or the shortest piece of rope

203
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,740
because they tell us that.

204
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,552
The other ones are some multiples of that length.

205
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:27,198
But they want to know

206
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,951
what is the length of the longest piece of rope?

207
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:32,170
the longest piece of rope

208
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,938
Well, the longest piece of rope is clearly piece 3.

209
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:37,221
Right? It's three times the second piece.

210
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:39,032
Piece 1 was only two times.

211
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:40,123
So this is what they want to know.

212
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:42,599
They want to know what 3x is equal to.

213
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:46,685
So 3x is equal to three times 20

214
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:48,819
which is equal to 60 feet.

215
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:51,992
And that's choice C.

216
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:54,344
Next problem.

217
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,845
Let's see if I have time.

218
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,188
Yeah, I think I have time.

219
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,177
I might as well attempt
to fit it in.

220
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:06,238
All right.

221
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,282
Don't want to rush them, though.

222
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,311
Let's see.

223
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:17,414
The cost to rent a construction crane is $750 per day

224
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,667
plus $250 per hour of use.

225
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,111
What is the maximum number of hours

226
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:26,835
the crane can be used each day

227
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:32,862
if the rental cost is not to exceed $2,500 per day?

228
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:36,772
OK, so how much is the cost per day?

229
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:40,989
So the cost per day is equal to $750.

230
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:42,916
So no matter how little or much we use it

231
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,981
we have to pay that $750 per day.

232
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:50,328
So it's equal to $750 plus $250 per hour

233
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:56,845
so plus $250 times the number of hours.

234
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:59,776
This is what our total cost is per day.

235
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:01,377
And they want to say

236
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,007
what is the maximum number of hours

237
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:05,197
the crane can be used each day

238
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:09,712
if the rental cost is not to exceed $2,500 per day?

239
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,218
So this whole thing has to be

240
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:13,973
less than or equal to $2,500.

241
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,201
The total cost has to be less than or equal to $2,500.

242
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:21,701
So now let's just solve this equation right there.

243
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:22,428
And I'll do it up here.

244
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:28,283
So we know that $750 plus $250

245
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:30,394
let me do it down here actually.

246
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:31,535
More space.

247
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:32,995
So what's the first thing we could do here?

248
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:36,683
We could subtract 750s from both sides of this equation.

249
00:11:36,683 --> 00:11:43,493
So we get 250 times h is less than or equal to

250
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:46,585
2,500 minus 750, that's what?

251
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:48,360
1,750?

252
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,300
Yeah, because 1,500 minus 750 is 750.

253
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,475
1,750.

254
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:57,219
I just subtracted 750 from both sides of this equation.

255
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:58,143
Let me write that down.

256
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:03,161
So I said minus 750, plus that.

257
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:05,508
And then I said minus 750.

258
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:09,525
And, of course, minus 750 plus 750, that goes to 0.

259
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,558
That's why you don't see anything over here.

260
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:16,001
And on the right-hand side, 2,500 minus 750 is 1,750.

261
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,122
All right, now let's just divide both sides by 250.

262
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:20,996
We don't have to do anything to the inequality sign

263
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:23,482
since 250 is a positive number.

264
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:26,147
So the hours, the maximum number of hours

265
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:33,159
the hours have to be less than or equal to 1,750 over 250

266
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,663
which is-- let's see, 1,750 divided by 250.

267
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:41,778
That's the same thing as 175 divided by 25.

268
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:45,914
25 goes into 175, what is that?

269
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:48,208
I want to say seven times?

270
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,199
7 times 5 is 35.

271
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:54,621
7 times 2 is 14 plus 3 is 17, right.

272
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:59,284
So h has to be less than or equal to 7 hours.

273
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:01,561
And that is choice C.

274
00:13:01,561 --> 99:59:59,999
See you in the next video.
