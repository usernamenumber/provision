1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,557
Ok, so I've been learning about Pythagoras

2
00:00:01,557 --> 00:00:03,270
and the dirt on him is just too good.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,194
You've probably heard of the Pythagorean Theorem

4
00:00:05,194 --> 00:00:06,807
but not the part where Pythagoras

5
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,579
was a crazy cult leader who thought he'd made

6
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:10,305
a deal with a god thousands of years ago

7
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:11,930
and could remember all of his past lives.

8
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,485
Oh, and he killed a guy.

9
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:16,361
I mean maybe it was a long time ago and he was afraid of beans.

10
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:17,873
As in beans, they just like freaked him out

11
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:19,185
or something, I don't know.

12
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,677
But mostly I want to talk about the murdery part.

13
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:23,064
See, Pythagoras and his cult of Pythagoreans

14
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,164
had this cool-kids club where they'd

15
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:25,907
talk about proportions all day.

16
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:27,381
They'd be like, "Hey, I drew a two by three

17
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:29,347
rectangle using a straight-edge and compass.

18
00:00:29,347 --> 00:00:30,714
Isn't that awesome?"

19
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:31,596
And then someone would be like,

20
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:34,296
"Hey guys, I have a box that's two by three and a half?"

21
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:35,696
And the cool kids would be like,

22
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:37,698
"Three and a half? That's not a number!

23
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:39,210
Get out of our club!"

24
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,856
And then they'd make the units half the length

25
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:43,115
and call it four by seven, and everything was okay.

26
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:46,062
Even if your box is 2.718 by 6.28

27
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:48,158
you can just divide your units into thousandths

28
00:00:48,158 --> 00:00:50,384
and you'd get a box that's a nice, even

29
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,846
2,718 by 6,280. It's not a simple proportion

30
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,907
but hey, the box still has a whole number proportion,

31
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:58,506
so Pythagoras is happy.

32
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,730
Unless it's a box of beans, then he freaks out.

33
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,233
I'd like to imagine what it would be like to

34
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:03,769
think of numbers the way they did.

35
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:05,346
Maybe you think of numbers as being on a line.

36
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:07,818
Numbers one way, zero, and negative numbers the other,

37
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,416
and there are numbers between them:

38
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,495
fractions, rationals, filling in the gaps.

39
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:12,760
But Pythagoras didn't think about numbers

40
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,072
like this at all.

41
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:15,389
They weren't points in a continuum

42
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:17,569
they were each their own, separate being,

43
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:19,124
which was still pretty modern because

44
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:21,531
before that people only thought of numbers as adjectives,

45
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:24,348
numbers of. In Pythagoras's world, there is

46
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:26,520
no number between seven and eight,

47
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,676
and there is no number three over two so much as

48
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:31,899
a relationship between three and two, a proportion.

49
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:33,675
Six to four has the same relationship

50
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,370
because the numbers share this evenness,

51
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,693
which when accounted for makes it three to two.

52
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:39,347
The universe to Pythagoras was made up

53
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:41,991
of these relationships. Mathematics wasn't numbers,

54
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:44,125
mathematics was between the numbers.

55
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,770
Though while people admire how much Pythagoras

56
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,867
loved proportions, there's a dark

57
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,598
flip side to that obsession.

58
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:51,904
How far was he willing to go to protect

59
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,753
the proportions he loved?

60
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:54,979
Would he kill for them?

61
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,581
Would he die for them?

62
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:58,635
And the answer was he'd go pretty far

63
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:00,521
until beans got involved.

64
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,205
It's time for Time Line Time.

65
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,730
Mathematicians like lines.

66
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,855
I want the context, because in school today

67
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:07,012
if you bring out the ruler and compass

68
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:09,094
and are like, "Let's do some geometry!

69
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:10,964
Let's draw two lines at 90 degree angles

70
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,342
using a straight-edge and compass!

71
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:13,782
Here's a happy square!"

72
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:15,580
Then you've probably had years of math class

73
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,426
already and think of geometry as being harder

74
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:18,868
than adding big numbers together.

75
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:20,796
You probably think that zero is a simple, easy concept

76
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:22,713
and have heard of decimals too.

77
00:02:22,713 --> 00:02:24,523
Well, here's now, 2012.

78
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:26,402
Here's Einstein, Euler, Newton and Da Vinci -

79
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:27,450
- that sure was a while ago!

80
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,507
Now let's go all the way back to when

81
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:30,362
Arabic numerals were invented and

82
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:31,984
brought to the West by Fibbonacci.

83
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:33,725
Before that, arithmetic was nightmarishly hard,

84
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:35,654
so if you can multiply multi-digit numbers together

85
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:37,213
you can go back in time and impress

86
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:39,038
the beans out of Pythagoras.

87
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:40,895
And before that there was no concept of

88
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,571
zero, except in India where zero

89
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,833
was discovered around here.

90
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,864
And if you keep going back you get to the year one,

91
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:47,293
(there's no year zero, of course,

92
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,701
because zero hadn't been invented)

93
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,370
and back a bit more you get to folk like

94
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,266
Aristotle, Euclid, Archimedes

95
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,900
and then finally Pythagoras,

96
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,552
all the way back in 6th century BCE.

97
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,421
Point is, you can do some pretty cool mathematics

98
00:02:58,421 --> 00:03:00,215
without having a good handle on arithmetic

99
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:01,784
and people did for a long time.

100
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:02,846
And in school when they tell you

101
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:04,375
you need to memorize your multiplication

102
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,070
table and graph a parabola

103
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,408
before you can learn real mathematics,

104
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:09,243
they are lying to you.

105
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:11,268
In Pythagoras's time there were no variables,

106
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:13,320
no equations or formulas like we see today,

107
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,567
Pythagoras's theorem wasn't

108
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,361
'a squared plus b squared equals c squared,'

109
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,736
it was 'The squares of the legs of a right triangle

110
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:21,552
have the same area as the square of the hypotenuse,'

111
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,493
all written out.

112
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,094
And when he said 'square' he meant 'square.'

113
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:26,620
One leg's square plus the other leg's square

114
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,810
equals hypotenuse's square.

115
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,326
Three literally squared plus four made into a square.

116
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,223
Those two squares have the same area as

117
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:34,799
a five by five square.

118
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,180
You can cut out the nine squares here

119
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,784
and the sixteen here and fit them together

120
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,080
where these 25 squares are, and in the same way,

121
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,640
you can cut out the 25 hypotenuse squares

122
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,541
and fit them into the two leg squares.

123
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,991
Pythagoras thought you could do this trick

124
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,388
with any right triangle,

125
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:47,672
that it was just a matter of figuring out

126
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:50,189
how many pieces to cut each side into.

127
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,188
There was a relationship between the length

128
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:54,026
of one side and the length of another

129
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,284
and he wanted to find it on this map.

130
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:58,618
But the trouble began with the simplest right triangle

131
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,801
one where both the legs are the same length,

132
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:03,164
one where both the legs' squares are equal.

133
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:04,971
If the legs are both one then the

134
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:06,035
hypotenuse is something that, when squared,

135
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:08,370
gives two. So what's the square root of two and

136
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,566
how do we make it into a whole number ratio?

137
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,681
Square root two is very close to 1.4

138
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:14,306
which would be a whole number ratio of 10:14

139
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:15,897
but 10 squared plus 10 squared is definitely

140
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:18,539
not 14 squared, and a ratio of 1,000 to

141
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,390
1,414 is even closer, and a ratio of

142
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,020
100,000,000 to 141,421,356 is very close indeed

143
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,328
but still not exact, so what is it?

144
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:30,610
Pythagoras wanted to find the perfect ratio

145
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,487
he knew it must exist, but meanwhile

146
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:35,212
someone from his very own Pythagorean brotherhood

147
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:37,033
proved there wasn't a ratio, the square root

148
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,286
of two is irrational, that in decimal notation

149
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:41,039
(once decimal notation was invented)

150
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,513
the digits go on forever. Usually this proof

151
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:45,539
is given algebraically, something like

152
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:46,655
this, which is pretty simple

153
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:47,678
and beautiful if you know algebra,

154
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:49,178
but the Pythagoreans didn't.

155
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:50,374
So I like to imagine how they thought

156
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,893
of this proof, no algebra required.

157
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,101
Okay, so Pythagoras is all like,

158
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:55,693
"There's totally a ratio, you can

159
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:56,989
make this with whole numbers."

160
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:59,197
And this guy's like,"Is not!" "Is too!"

161
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:01,196
"Is not!" "Is too!" "Fine have it your way.

162
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:02,910
So, there's a whole number ratio in simplest

163
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,037
form, where this square plus this square equals

164
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:07,145
this square." "Yeah, that's the Pythagorean

165
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:09,149
theorem, I made it." "Yeah, though for this triangle

166
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,343
you don't even need the full theorem.

167
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,434
it's easy to see that it's the same area

168
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:14,026
by cutting each part into four triangles."

169
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:15,808
"But I don't want to divide the squares up

170
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:17,403
into triangles, I want unit squares."

171
00:05:17,403 --> 00:05:20,302
"So kind of like this, where this square is

172
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:21,599
divided into units and so is this one and

173
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,610
they all fit perfectly into this one and vice versa,

174
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,057
but not like this. It almost works, but you

175
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:28,146
start dividing this square evenly to fill up

176
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:29,831
the two equal other squares, and you've got

177
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,186
this one odd one out. There's an odd number

178
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:34,022
of squares to begin with, so you can't

179
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,751
divide them evenly between the two squares."

180
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:38,036
"That's not even a right triangle, what's your point?"

181
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:40,221
"Just that you know an odd number like seven

182
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,807
isn't gonna be it without even trying.

183
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,149
An odd number times itself gives an odd number

184
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,974
of squares, so whatever this number is,

185
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:49,060
it can't be seven, it has to be even."

186
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,229
"Ok, so the hypotenuse is even, that's fine."

187
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,123
"So what if I proved the leg is even too?"

188
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:54,660
"Then it's not in simplest form."

189
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,077
"Any ratio where both are even you divide by two until

190
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:59,548
you can't divide anymore, because one of them is odd

191
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:01,507
and then that ratio is the best. I thought

192
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:03,970
we assumed we were talking about the simplest form ratio."

193
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,224
"We are. If there's a ratio in simlest form at least

194
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,922
one of the numbers is odd and since the hypotenuse has to

195
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:12,383
literally be divisible by two, then the leg must be the odd one.

196
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:14,448
So what if I proved the leg had to be even?"

197
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:16,770
"You just proved it's not. It can't be both."

198
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,758
"Unless it doesn't exist!

199
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:21,430
What you forget Pythagoras is that if this is a square

200
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,010
then the two sides are the same. Just as this is divsible

201
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,643
right down the center so too is it divisible the other way!

202
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:28,723
And the number squares on this side, which are

203
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:32,121
the number of squares in just one leg is an even number.

204
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:33,703
And for a number of squares to be even what

205
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:36,690
does the number have to be, Pythagoras, oh my brother?"

206
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,131
"If leg squared is even then the leg is even.

207
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,694
But it can't be even, because it's already odd."

208
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:43,810
"Unless it doesn't exist."

209
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,407
"But if they're both even you can divide both

210
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:47,821
by two and start again, but this still has to be even

211
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,486
which means this still has to be even, which means

212
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:52,202
you can divide by two again, but then it has to be even

213
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:54,822
so everything is even forever and you never find

214
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:57,365
the perfect ratio. Aww, beans"

215
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:59,810
He had a vision, a beautiful vision of a world

216
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,077
made up of relationships between numbers.

217
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:04,526
If this wasn't a whole number ratio, then what was it?

218
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:07,178
The Pythagoreans still believed, wanted to believe

219
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,045
that irrationality was somehow false and the world

220
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:12,225
was as they wanted it. So this proof stayed secret.

221
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:14,403
Until someone spilled the beans.

222
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:16,928
According to some, it was all a guy named Hippasus

223
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:19,154
and Pythagoras threw him of a boat to drown him

224
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:22,157
as punishment for ruining what had been perfect.

225
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:23,917
Or maybe it was someone else who discovered it

226
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:25,508
or Hippasus or someone else who was killed

227
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:27,082
by the Pythagoreans long after Pythagoras was

228
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:29,428
dead or maybe they just got exiled, who knows?

229
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:31,007
And how did Pythagoras die?

230
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:32,523
Well, according to one guy some guys got mad

231
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:34,874
because they didn't get into the cool kids' club.

232
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:36,823
So they set Pythagoras' house on fire.

233
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,325
And Pythagoras was running away and they

234
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,123
were chasing him, but then they came upon a field

235
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:42,684
and not just any field, but a field of beans.

236
00:07:42,684 --> 00:07:45,434
And Pythagoras turned around to face his pursuers

237
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:47,614
and proclaimed: "Better to be slaughetered

238
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:50,417
by enemies than to trample on beans!"

239
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,653
And he was. Others say he ran off and starved

240
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:54,333
himself to death. Or just got caught by his enemies

241
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,714
because he ran around the bean field instead of through it

242
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:58,945
or who knows what happened. People claim Pythagoras

243
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,610
didn't like beans because he thought they were

244
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,504
bad for digestion, or gave you bad dreams

245
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:03,808
or reminded him of male genitalia or

246
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:05,571
because he didn't want a clubhouse full of

247
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:07,455
flatulating mathematicians or he just didn't

248
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:08,664
like them metaphorically.

249
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:11,099
He and his followers were or weren't vegetarian

250
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,682
did or didn't sacrifice animals

251
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:15,750
possibly were only allowed to eat certain colors of birds

252
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,916
I mean he definitely had a lot of rules to follow

253
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,865
but just what they were and what they meant

254
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,305
is lost to history.

255
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:23,323
I'd like to give you a colorful story about exactly

256
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,013
what happened with Pythagoras, but somehow

257
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:26,852
that kind of truth doesn't last.

258
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:29,124
What I do know is that the square root of two is

259
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,044
irrational, that there's no way to have

260
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,759
the length of a side of a square and of the

261
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,221
square's diagonal both be whole numbers.

262
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:37,897
Mathematical truth is truth that indures.

263
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:40,226
This proof is just as good now as it was

264
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:42,933
2500 years ago, I mean it's awesome and

265
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:43,700
it shows that there's more to the

266
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,125
world than whole numbers and

267
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,374
shame on the Pythagoreans who didn't have

268
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:50,000
the beans to admit it.
