00:00:01,205 --> 00:00:03,554
what i want to do in this video is to think about fairly traditional business.

2
00:00:03,554 --> 00:00:05,971
i am going to do the orange juice business.

3
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,971
right over here i have written the gallons of orange juice

4
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:12,304
that i am going to produce each week

5
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,406
so all of these are going to be a per week basis

6
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:15,988
this is my fixed cost.

7
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:17,721
so i assume that it's going to cost me one thousand dollars.

8
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:23,054
let's say that's the rent fot this super robotic orange juicer that i bought

9
00:00:23,054 --> 00:00:26,471
that can really... and through that for the sake of simplicity,

10
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:28,488
we can assume that we can produce as much orange juice as we want

11
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:30,504
as any of the amount i listed right over there

12
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:36,854
and it also takes into the cost of paying some employees

13
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:39,004
or spending some of the time uprating this super orange juice maker.

14
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,621
some assume that all of these are fixed cost,

15
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:42,504
that i can't get out of them or buy them overnight

16
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:51,170
that i decided that i plunked down the cost of machine, that i've already given these employees one year contract.

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,604
so these are going to be fixed at least for the next year.

18
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:55,837
now my variable cost here

19
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:58,971
this is going to be given the amount of juice i wanna produce

20
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,604
this is going to be my cost of oranges

21
00:01:00,604 --> 00:01:02,555
and i guess we can also see the cost of transporting the oranges.

22
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:08,254
so we see here, obviously if we produce no orange juice, we have no variable cost.

23
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:14,721
if we produce a thousand oranges, then our cost of the oranges and transporting them is 500 dollars.

24
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:17,238
if we produce two thousand, it's 850.

25
00:01:17,238 --> 00:01:18,654
something interesting happens.

26
00:01:18,654 --> 00:01:24,054
our incremental variable cost right over here when it's only 350 dollars.

27
00:01:24,054 --> 99:59:59,999
the first thousand of oranges is 500. and then the next thousand it is only 350.
