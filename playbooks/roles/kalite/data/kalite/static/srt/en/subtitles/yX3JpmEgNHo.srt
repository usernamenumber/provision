Part D- Find the average rate of change of "F" on the interval from x is greater than or equal to -4

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is less than equal to x which is less than or equal to 3 so really the interval, whether you picked or not, is right here

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here. And they say there is no Point C between in that interval where "F" prime is, you

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
see, equal to the average rate of change. Explain why the statement does not contradict the mean value

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here. Fascinating! Alright... let's do this first part first- The average rate of change of "F" on the

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
interval, sounds like a very fancy thing, but the average rate of change on the interval is really just

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the slope of the line that connects the end points of the interval. So this right over here is the end

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
points and let's figure out the slope of this line. So going from this point to that point are a change in x (this is a color you are not likely to see).

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Our change in x over here... is equal to 7. You get that by taking 3 - - 4 or you could just count: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7-

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Our change in x and our change in y, when we run over 7, when we go 7 to the right, our change in y... equals

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
-2. We went from -1 to -3 which is equal to -2. So slope.... which is change- in- y/ change-in-x (rise/run),

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to 7 / -2. Or it is the other way around- change in y is -2 / 7 so negative two sevenths. And that's

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
all it is. You could kind of think of it in a more fancy sense, but you are going to get the same answer

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you said, "Oh WOW loook- the average rate of change of "F" on the interval (well the rate of change)

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of "F" is "F" prime of x. That is the rate of change of xf at any point of x. If you were want to find

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the average value of this, over the interval, you would integrate it from our starting point from -4

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to 3 (dx), then you would divide it by your change in x, so then when you divide it, you would have it

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over 1 / 7. But then this part right over here is going to be the same thing as "F" of 3 - "F" of 4, and

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then this over here you a 7 in the denominator. SO this is really just your change in x, which is my

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
definition or how we actually set up this average right over here, and this over here is just your change

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in y. So it really is just a slope between the end point. SO we did the first part- the average rate

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of change of "F" onto the interval is -2 / 7. Now, let's look at the second part, they say there is no point

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
see in that interval from which "F" primacy is equal to the average rate of change. Explain why the statement

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
does not contradict the mean value theorem. The mean value theorem, as a little bit of review..., it says

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that if we have some type of an interval (so let me draw some axis right over here) if you have an

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
interval (and I'll draw my interval like this) and over that interval has a deferential function....so

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe my function looks like this. It says that there is at least one point C on that interval where

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the derivative at that point c is equal to the average rate of change. So the way I've drawn it right over here

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the average rate of change of this function (I'll do it in magenta right over here) and the mean value

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
theorem says that if this is a deferential here is at least one Point C in this interval where I have the

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
same slope, where the tangid line has the same slope, where the derivative is the same as the

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
slope as the average slope. And you can see here that it is probably over here where you have a lot of

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
points or less. If you think about it, it is kind of intuitive that at some point here we obviously have a

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
larger slope and over here we have a smaller slope and since it is deferential our derivative is continuous

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so at some the slope has to get to do the exactly what the average slope is. Lets look at this little

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
conundrum right over here. Why is there not a Point C where "F" primacy is equal to the average rate

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of change. And you can even verify that because from -4 to 0 our slope is positive and then the slope

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just jumps down to a negative which is 2 and or -2 it never goes down to -2. This is not a derferential

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
problem where x = 0 our slope jumps here and because it is not deferential the mean value theorem does

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not apply. And you can imagine that if it had some continuous derivative then you would find a pint.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If it looked something like this instead I'll continue over here... the slope would be the same as the average slope

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and right over there, it is really because "F" is not deferential over the entire interval. It does

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not have a continuous derivative because it jumps straight down to -2 right over here it does not go continuously through all the values in between.
