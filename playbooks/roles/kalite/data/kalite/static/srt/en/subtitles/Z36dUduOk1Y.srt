1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,880
Let's just talk about the humoral response right now, that deals with B lymphocytes.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:15,340
So B lymphocytes or B cells--let me do them in blue, B for blue

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,200
So let's say that that is a B lymphocyte.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,720
It's a white blood cell, it's a subset of white blood cells called lymphocytes.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,360
It comes from the bone marrow

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,360
and that's where the-- well, the B comes from

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,605
bursa of Fabricius, but we don't want to go into detail there.

8
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:30,760
But they have all of these proteins on their surface.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,280
Actually, close to 10,000 of them.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,890
I get very excited about B cells and I'll tell you why in a second

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,390
It has all of these proteins on them that look something like this.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,120
I'll just draw a couple of them.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,740
These are actually protein complexes, you can kind of view them.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,380
They actually have four separate proteins on them and

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,215
we can call these proteins membrane bound antibodies.

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,460
And I'll talk a lot more about antibodies.

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,920
You've probably heard the word.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,860
You have antibodies for such and such flu, or such and such virus

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,800
and we're going to talk more about that in the future,

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,060
but antibodies are just proteins.

21
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,330
They're often referred to as immunoglobulins.

22
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,360
These are essentially equivalent words.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,000
Antibodies or immunoglobulins-- and they're really just proteins.

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,640
Now, B cells have these on the surface of their membranes.

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,290
These are membrane bound.

26
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,050
Usually when people talk about antibodies

27
00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:00,140
they're talking about free antibodies that are
going to just be floating around like that.

28
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,410
And I'm going to go into more detail on how those are produced

29
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,009
Now what's really, really, really, really, really interesting about these membrane bound antibodies

30
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,220
and these B cells in particular is

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,465
that a B cell has one type of membrane bound antibody on it .

32
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:29,730
It's going to also have antibodies, but those antibodies are going to be different.

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,920
So we'll focus on where
they're different.

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,360
Let me just draw them the same
color first and then we'll

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,805
focus on where they're
different.

36
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,840
These are both B cells.

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,190
They both have these
antibodies on them.

38
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,130
The interesting thing is that
from one B cell to another B

39
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,200
cell, they have a variable part
on this antibody that

40
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,780
could take on a bunch of
different forms. So this one

41
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,960
might look like that and that.

42
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,720
So these long-- I'll go into
more detail on that.

43
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,600
The fixed portion, you can
imagine is green for any kind

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,500
of antibody, and then there's
a variable portion.

45
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,710
So maybe this guy's variable
portion is--

46
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,900
I'll do it in pink.

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,520
And every one of the antibodies
bound to his

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,220
membrane are going to have that
same variable portion.

49
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,100
This different B cell
is going to have

50
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,310
different variable portions.

51
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,640
So I'll do that in a
different color.

52
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,270
Maybe I'll do it in magenta.

53
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,690
So his variable portions are
going to be different.

54
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,410
Now he has 10,000 of these on
a surface and every one of

55
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,170
these have the same variable
portions, but they're all

56
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,600
different from the variable
portions on this B cell.

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,110
There's actually 10 billion
different combinations of

58
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,360
variable portions.

59
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,779
So the first question-- and I
haven't even told you what the

60
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,640
variable portions are good for--
is, how do that many

61
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,149
different combinations arise?

62
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,990
Obviously these proteins-- or
maybe not so obviously-- all

63
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,420
these proteins that are part of
most cells are produced by

64
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,200
the genes of that cell.

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,200
So if I draw-- this
is the nucleus.

66
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,050
It's got DNA inside
the nucleus.

67
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,240
This guy has a nucleus.

68
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,360
It's got DNA inside
the nucleus.

69
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,410
If these guys are both B cells
and they're both coming from

70
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,000
the same germ line, they're
coming from the same, I guess,

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,180
ancestry of cells, shouldn't
they have the same DNA?

72
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,300
If they do have the same DNA,
why are the proteins that

73
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,530
they're constructing
different?

74
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,800
How do they change?

75
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,090
And this is why I find B cells--
and you'll see this is

76
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,720
also true of T cells-- to be
fascinating is, in their

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,940
development, in their
hematopoiesis-- that's just

78
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,610
the development of these
lymphocytes.

79
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,960
At one stage in their
development, there's just a

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,990
lot of shuffling of the portion
of their DNA that

81
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,200
codes for here, for these
parts of the protein.

82
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,990
There's just a lot of shuffling
that occurs.

83
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,080
Most of when we talk about
DNA, we really want to

84
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,510
preserve the information, not
have a lot of shuffling.

85
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,110
But when these lymphocytes,
when these B cells are

86
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,270
maturing, at one stage of their
maturation or their

87
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,120
development, there's intentional
reshuffling of the

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,490
DNA that codes for this
part and this part.

89
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,160
And that's what leads to all
of the diversity in the

90
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,980
variable portions on these
membrane bound

91
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,770
immunoglobulins.

92
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,620
And we're about to find out why
there's that diversity.

93
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,890
So there's tons of stuff that
can infect your body.

94
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:12,220
Viruses are are mutating and
evolving and so are bacteria.

95
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,490
You don't know what's going
to enter your body.

96
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,480
So what the immune system has
done through B cells-- and

97
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,200
we'll also see it through T
cells-- it says, hey, let me

98
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,940
just make a bunch of
combinations of these things

99
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,470
that can essentially bind
to whatever I get to.

100
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,010
So let's say that there's
just some new virus

101
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,900
that shows up, right?

102
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,190
The world has never seen this
virus before this B cell,

103
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,940
it'll bump into this virus and
this virus won't attach.

104
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,750
Another B cell will bump
into this virus

105
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,740
and it won't attach.

106
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,370
And maybe several thousands of
B cells will bump into this

107
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,620
virus and it won't attach, but
since I have so many B cells

108
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,620
having so many different
combinations of these variable

109
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,570
portions on these receptors,
eventually one of these B

110
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,650
cells is going to bond.

111
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,900
Maybe it's this one.

112
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,620
He's going to bond to part of
the surface of this virus.

113
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,440
It could also be to part of a
surface of a new bacteria, or

114
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,630
part of a surface for some
foreign protein.

115
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,080
And part of the surface that it
binds on the bacteria-- so

116
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,050
maybe it binds on that part of
the bacteria-- this is called

117
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,300
an epitope.

118
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,200
So once this guy binds to some
foreign pathogen-- and

119
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,730
remember, the other B cells
won't-- only the particular

120
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,790
one that had the particular
combination, one of

121
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,760
the 10 to the 10th.

122
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,000
And actually, there aren't 10
to the 10th combinations.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,310
During their development,
they weed out all of the

124
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,760
combinations that would bind to
things that are essentially

125
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,070
you, that there shouldn't be
an immune response to.

126
00:07:52,070 --> 00:08:00,350
So we could say self-responding
combinations

127
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,550
weeded out.

128
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,950
So there actually aren't 10
to the 10th, 10 billion

129
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,690
combinations of these--
something smaller than that.

130
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,940
You have to take out all the
combinations that would have

131
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,770
bound to your own cells, but
there's still a super huge

132
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,000
number of combinations that are
very likely to bond, at

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,460
least to some part of some
pathogen of some

134
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,200
virus or some bacteria.

135
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,680
And as soon as one of these B
cells binds, it says, hey

136
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,650
guys, I'm the lucky guy who
happens to fit exactly this

137
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,110
brand new pathogen.

138
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:36,909
He becomes activated after
binding to the new pathogen.

139
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,630
And I'm going to go into more
detail in the future.

140
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,880
In order to really become
activated, you normally need

141
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,210
help from helper T cells,
but I don't want to

142
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,610
confuse you in the video.

143
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,550
So in this case, I'm going to
assume that activation can

144
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,690
only occur-- or that it just
needs to respond, it just

145
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,080
needs to essentially
be triggered by

146
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,200
binding with the pathogen.

147
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,670
In most cases, you
actually need the

148
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,785
helper T cells as well.

149
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:03,420
And we'll discuss why
that's important.

150
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,280
It's kind of a fail
safe mechanism

151
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,090
for your immune system.

152
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,830
But once this guy gets
activated, he's going to start

153
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,060
cloning himself.

154
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,500
He's going to say, look, I'm
the guy that can match this

155
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,390
virus here-- and so he's going
to start cloning himself.

156
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,810
He's going to start dividing
and repeating himself.

157
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,010
So there's just going to be
multiple versions of this guy.

158
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,240
So they all start to replicate
and they also differentiate--

159
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,110
differentiate means they start
taking particular roles.

160
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,350
So there's two forms
of differentiation.

161
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,100
So many, many, many hundreds
or thousands of these are

162
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,270
going to be produced.

163
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:01,210
And then some are going to
become memory cells, which are

164
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,850
essentially just B cells that
stick around a long time with

165
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,660
the perfect receptor on them,
with the perfect variable

166
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,500
portion of their receptor
on them.

167
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,440
So some will be memory cells
and they're going to be in

168
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,140
higher quantities than
they were originally.

169
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,770
So if if this guy invades our
bodies 10 years in the future,

170
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,120
they're going to have more of
these guys around that are

171
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,540
more likely to bump into them
and start and get activated

172
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,710
and then some of them
are going to turn

173
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,760
into effector cells.

174
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,640
And effector cells are generally
cells that actually

175
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,890
do something.

176
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,580
What the effector cells do is,
they turn into antibody-- they

177
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,050
turn into these effector B
cells-- or sometimes they're

178
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,030
called plasma cells.

179
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,175
They're going to turn into
antibody factories.

180
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,690
And the antibodies they're going
to produce are exactly

181
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,800
this combination, the date that
they originally had being

182
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,050
membrane bound.

183
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,230
So they're just going to start
producing these antibodies

184
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,650
that we talk about with the
exact-- they're going to start

185
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,260
spitting out these antibodies.

186
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,670
They're going to start spitting
out tons and tons of

187
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,660
these proteins that are uniquely
able to bind to the

188
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,340
new pathogen, this new
thing in question.

189
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,430
So an activated effector cell
will actually produce 2,000

190
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,590
antibodies a second.

191
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,270
So you can imagine, if you have
a lot of these, you're

192
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,290
going to have all of a sudden
a lot of antibodies floating

193
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,500
around in your body and going
into the body tissues.

194
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,600
And the value of that and why
this is the humoral system is,

195
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,560
all of a sudden, you have all
of these viruses that are

196
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,020
infecting your system, but now
you're producing all of these

197
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,820
antibodies.

198
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,680
The effector cells are these
factories and so these

199
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,960
specific antibodies will
start bonding.

200
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,510
So let me draw it like this.

201
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:22,370
The specific antibodies will
start bonding to these viruses

202
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,360
and that has a couple
of values to it.

203
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,180
One is, it essentially tags
them for pick up.

204
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,700
Now phagocytosis-- this is
called opsonization.

205
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,730
When you tag molecules for
pickup and you make them

206
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:51,260
easier for phagocytes to eat
them up, this is what--

207
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,600
antibodies are attaching and
say, hey phagocytes, this is

208
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,290
going to make it easier.

209
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,760
You should pick up these
guys in particular.

210
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,180
It also might make these viruses
hard to function.

211
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,240
I have this big thing hanging
off the side of it.

212
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,110
It might be harder for them to
infiltrate cells and the other

213
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,110
thing is, on each of these
antibodies you have two

214
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,460
identical heavy chains
and then two

215
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,710
identical light chains.

216
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,250
And then they have a very
specific variable portion on

217
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,450
each one and each of these
branches can bond to the

218
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,760
epitope on a virus.

219
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,970
So you can imagine, what happens
if this guy bonds to

220
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,760
one epitope and this guy
bonds to another virus?

221
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,110
Then all of a sudden, these
viruses are kind of glued

222
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,950
together and that's even
more efficient.

223
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,680
They're not going to be able to
do what they normally do.

224
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,910
They're not going to be able
to enter cell membranes and

225
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,340
they're perfectly tagged.

226
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,650
They've been opsonized so
that phagocytes can come

227
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,520
and eat them up.

228
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,770
So we'll talk more about B cells
in the future, but I

229
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,480
just find it fascinating that
there are that many

230
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,100
combinations and they have
enough combinations to really

231
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,210
recognize almost anything that
can exist in the fluids of our

232
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,760
body, but we haven't solved
all of the problems yet.

233
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,950
We haven't solved the problem
of what happens when things

234
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,060
actually infiltrate cells
or we have cancer cells?

235
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,270
How do we kill cells that have
clearly gone astray?
