1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,810
Let's say I have a matrix where
everything below the

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,530
main diagonal is a 0.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,610
And I'll start-- just for the
sake of argument, let's start

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,860
with a 2 by 2 matrix.

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,460
   

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,930
I have the values
a, b, 0, and d.

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,180
Instead of a c, I have a 0
there, so everything below the

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,260
main diagonal is a 0.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,190
What is the determinant
of this going to be?

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,590
Let's call that matrix A.

12
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:34,000
The determinant of A is going
to be equal to ad

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,890
minus b times 0.

14
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,900
That's just a 0, so you don't
have to write it.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,030
It's equal to a times d.

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,710
Now, let's say I have
another matrix.

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,332
Let's call it B.

18
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:45,855
We'll say it's a
3 by 3 matrix.

19
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:48,950
   

20
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,860
And let's say its entries
are a, b, c.

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,750
We've got a 0 here.

22
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,360
Then you-- let's say you have
a d here, e, then you have

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,660
another 0 here, another 0
here, and you have an f.

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,510
Once again, all of the entries
below the main diagonal are 0.

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,420
What's this guy's determinant?

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,550
Well, we learned several videos
ago that you can always

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,160
pick the row in the column that
has the most 0's on it.

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,240
That simplifies your
situation.

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,330
Let's find the determinant along
this column right here.

30
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:28,660
The determinant of b is going
to be equal to a times the

31
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,030
submatrix if you were to ignore
a's row and column.

32
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:42,410
a times the determinant of d,
e, 0, f, and then minus 0

33
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,550
times its submatrix.

34
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,570
You could cancel out-- or times
the determinant of its

35
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,830
submatrix, that row
and that column.

36
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,190
You'd get b, c, 0, f.

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,850
   

38
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,980
And then you have plus 0 times--
you get rid of that

39
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,120
row, that column, you
get b, c, d, e.

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,870
   

41
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,590
Obviously, these two guys
are going to be 0.

42
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,760
I don't care what these 2 by
2 matrices-- what their

43
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,539
determinants end up
evaluating to.

44
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,850
These are both going to be
equal to 0, because we're

45
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,380
multiplying by 0.

46
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,100
We're left with a times the
determinant of this, and the

47
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,670
determinant of this is pretty
straightforward.

48
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,670
We're going to have-- it's just
going to be equal to a

49
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,550
times the determinant of this,
which is df minus 0 times e.

50
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,800
It's just going to be df.

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,770
   

52
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,240
The determinant of b is adf.

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,640
Notice that the determinant
of A was just a and d.

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,430
Now, you might see a pattern.

55
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,590
In both cases we had 0's below
the main diagonal, right?

56
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,260
This was the main diagonal
right here.

57
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,250
And when we took the
determinants of the matrix,

58
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:52,140
the determinant just ended up
being the product of the

59
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,230
entries along the
main diagonal.

60
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,390
And if you think that that's
a general trend that always

61
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,290
applies, you are correct.

62
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,130
We can do it in the
general case.

63
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,340
Let's do it with our
general case.

64
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:11,710
Let's say we have some matrix,
A, and it is equal to a, 1, 1.

65
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,460
And you have a, 2, 2.

66
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,390
You're going to have
a 0 right there.

67
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,660
And then you just keep going all
the way down to a, n, n.

68
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,560
In this row, everything's going
to be a 0, except for

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,920
that last column.

70
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,960
This is all a 0 right here.

71
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,120
So everything below the main
diagonal is a 0, just like

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,720
this one, but we're doing it
in the general n by n case.

73
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,075
And everything up here is--
well, it doesn't have to be 0.

74
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:43,980
This is a, 1, 2, all
the way to a, 1, n.

75
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,530
This is a, 2, n.

76
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,320
Keep going down.

77
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,070
So everything at the main
diagonal or above isn't

78
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,680
necessarily equal to 0.

79
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,440
If you wanted to find the
determinant of A, we could do

80
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,410
the same thing we did here.

81
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:02,270
We could go down that first
row right there.

82
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:08,200
The determinant of our matrix,
A, is equal to this guy-- a,

83
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,960
1, 1-- times the determinant
of its submatrix.

84
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,895
That's going to be a, 2, 2.

85
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:20,329
It goes all the way to a, 2, n,
and then a, 3, 3, all the

86
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,410
way to a, n, n.

87
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,190
And then, everything down here
is-- these are all 0's.

88
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,160
Once again, we have another
situation where all of the

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,940
entries below the main
diagonal are 0.

90
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,480
What's the determinant of
this guy right here?

91
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,860
And what-- you might say
hey, what about the

92
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,570
rest of that row?

93
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,850
Well, the rest of the row is
just a bunch of 0's, just like

94
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,570
we had here.

95
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,435
0 times the determinant of its
submatrix, and then that would

96
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:48,640
be a minus and a plus.

97
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,260
0 times the determinant of its
submatrix, so on and so forth.

98
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,900
We just have to pay attention
to this term right there.

99
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,360
Now, the same argument
we can do here.

100
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,090
To find this determinant, we
can just go down that row.

101
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,870
The determinant of this is just
going to be equal to--

102
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,010
let's write out-- let's not
forget our a, 1, 1 out there.

103
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:14,187
The determinant of this is going
to be a, 2, 2 times the

104
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:15,370
determinant of its submatrix.

105
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,290
Get rid of its row and its
column, and you're just left

106
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,880
with a, 3, 3 all the way
down to a, n, n.

107
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,520
Everything up here is non-zero,
so its a, 3n.

108
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,440
Then everything below the
diagonal, once again, is just

109
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,960
a bunch of 0's.

110
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,630
Everything down here
is a bunch of 0's.

111
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,650
This is another of
what we call an

112
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,090
upper triangular matrix.

113
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,110
Let me write that down.

114
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,980
This whole class, where you
have 0's below the main

115
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,200
diagonal, these are called upper
triangular matrices.

116
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,710
   

117
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,080
Matrices, just like that.

118
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,940
Now, we keep doing the process
over and over again.

119
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,100
If you just keep following this
pattern over and again,

120
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,250
now you're going to have the
determinant of this is a, 3, 3

121
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,400
times its submatrix.

122
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,820
And every time, the
submatrix is

123
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,440
getting smaller and smaller.

124
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,160
You'll eventually get to a, 1,
1 times a, 2, 2 times-- all

125
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:22,950
the way to an minus 2 times
a 2 by 2 matrix over here.

126
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:29,320
This is going to be an minus
1, n minus 1, an.

127
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,260
Then this is going to be
a sub n minus 1, n.

128
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,770
Then you're going to have
a 0 right here.

129
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,130
It's just the bottom right-hand
corner of our

130
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,750
original matrix, is what you're
going to be left with.

131
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,890
And what is the determinant
of this?

132
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,900
Well, it's just the product
of these two things.

133
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,820
It's just this guy times this
guy minus this guy times that

134
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,480
guy, but that's just 0.

135
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:56,080
The determinant of A ends up
becoming a, 1, 1 times a, 2,

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,520
2, all the way to a, n, n, or
the product of all of the

137
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,430
entries of the main diagonal.

138
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,850
Which is a super important take
away, because it really

139
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,210
simplifies finding the
determinants of what would

140
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,880
otherwise be really hard
matrices to find the

141
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,300
determinants of.

142
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,830
You could imagine if this
was a 100 by 100 matrix.

143
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,300
Now, we could just multiply
the diagonal.

144
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,020
Just to make sure that
things are clear,

145
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,725
let me do an example.

146
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:27,230
Let's say we find the
determinant of 7, 3, 4, 2.

147
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,340
So we have 0's here.

148
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,650
This is a minus 2, 1, and a 3,
a 0 here-- sorry, we don't

149
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,750
want 0's there.

150
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,190
We don't need to
have 0's there.

151
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,480
6, 7-- we actually could have
0's there, but we don't need

152
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,950
to have 0's there.

153
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,780
And a 0 there, and we
have 0's there.

154
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,500
Just like that.

155
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:45,650
So

156
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,680
its upper triangular matrix--
if you want to evaluate this

157
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,220
determinant, you just multiply
these entries right here.

158
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,880
The determinant is equal to 7
times minus 2 times 1 times 3.

159
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,730
So it's 7 times minus 6 which
is equal to minus 42.

160
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,740
And it's that easy.

161
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:06,932
