1
00:00:00,464 --> 00:00:05,991
We finished off the last video entering into the Great Depression. It wasn't just a depression in the

2
00:00:05,991 --> 00:00:09,520
U.S. it was a depression all over the world. But I want to back up a little bit because I forgot to

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:16,765
mention a very important fact that's hugely important to the rest of U.S. history in the 20th century

4
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:23,800
and that's what happened in 1917 during World War I. And that's the Bolshevik Revolution. The Russian

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,454
Empire was overthrown by the Bolsheviks and it became the Soviet Union, which you probably know was

6
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:37,129
a Communist state and it became the United States's arch enemy over the rest of...well not over the rest

7
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:43,584
of...but near the second half of the twentieth century. So with that out of the way, I just want to make

8
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:48,599
sure you know that Russia is now the Soviet Union. Let's fast forward back through the Great Depression

9
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:54,079
and probably the one point when we're doing this very high level overview that's of interest, and as

10
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,095
you can see, even though the focus of this series of videos is on U.S. interests, what's happening in

11
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:02,733
the rest of the world is starting to become much more important because the U.S. is starting to become

12
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:11,169
this really serious global actor. And so in 1933, so this is right in the middle of this global depression

13
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:16,324
and Germany was especially hit hard because of all the damage done by WWI and all the war

14
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:22,500
reparations and all the rest. You have Hitler coming to power as Chancellor of Germany.

15
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,213
It's interesting to note that he came to power in a Democratic process. Chancellor of Germany

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,417
is analogous to Prime Minister in other countries.

17
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:39,405
Essentially he was ruling a coalition. The Nazis, his party, did not have a majority, but they were able

18
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:43,677
to control a coalition. Although it was a very weak one. But what they were good at is intimidating

19
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:47,299
and rigging elections and all the rest. And so over the course of the rest of the

20
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:53,429
30s, essentially the Nazis consolidated power until we get to 1939, and the rest of the world

21
00:01:53,429 --> 00:02:00,117
kept watching Hitler, you know he was consolidating power, and he came in democratically but he

22
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:04,761
was essentially consolidating power under himself, turning it into a dictatorship,

23
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:09,544
he was militarizing Germany. People started to get concerned but they all kind of wanted to

24
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:14,188
...they had the doctrine of appeasement - you know "hey, let's just kind of not make him too

25
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:18,553
angry and maybe he won't start anything too bad." But in 1939

26
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:24,823
Germany invades Poland. And this is kind of viewed

27
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:30,024
as the one event that kind of...you know the straw that breaks the camel's back so-to-speak...

28
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:35,783
and so it begins WWII

29
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:42,284
And initially it's between...I guess the great powers that initially get involved are

30
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:47,811
the British Empire and the Soviet Union. France is involved and quickly gets overrun by the Nazis

31
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:53,679
And what happens is that the U.S., it wasn't like this situation with WWI when the U.S. was trying to

32
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:58,167
stay neutral. The U.S. had recognized, especially FDR - Franklin Delano Roosevelt -

33
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:03,136
he had recognized that Hitler was an aggressor.

34
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:07,315
That he was, I guess from FDR's point of view, definitely in the wrong here.

35
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:15,866
So even in the beginning of WWII, the U.S. did help support the allies

36
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:21,050
so it would send arms and any other type of assistance. When Japan and Italy

37
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,713
go in on the side of Germany, the U.S. embargoed oil to Japan.

38
00:03:26,713 --> 00:03:30,816
The U.S. was an exporter of oil to Japan and you can imagine Japan did not produce

39
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:34,778
a lot of its own oil, and oil is super important when you are trying to run a

40
00:03:34,778 --> 00:03:40,566
war machine. So that didn't make Japan too happy. So you fast-forward to 1941 and you have

41
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:47,239
Japan bombing Pearl Harbor. So until this point the U.S. kind of played a nondirect

42
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,062
role. It definitely supported the allies and did what it could economically

43
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:56,356
and by providing military aide, but it did not actively participate in the fighting

44
00:03:56,356 --> 00:04:05,582
But then 12/7/1941, the Japanese bomb the U.S. Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor

45
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:11,977
and this is a whole interesting debate because it was lucky for the US that most

46
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:16,882
of the Pacific fleet was not there, but it was obviously this kind of thing that

47
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:22,455
convinced the US public that WWII was worth joining.

48
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:29,050
So 1941, because of Pearl Harbor, the US enters the war. And it enters the war in both arenas,

49
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:35,040
both in Europe and the Pacific. And then you fast forward - it goes against the Italians

50
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,963
in North Africa, and then you fast forward to 1944 and it actually enters

51
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:46,511
into the fight in mainland Europe. This is the invasion of Normandy. This is D Day

52
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:52,920
June 6th 1944. If you've ever seen Saving Private Ryan it starts with this.

53
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,703
I've never stormed a beach, but I can imagine that was probably the most realistic

54
00:04:57,703 --> 00:05:04,901
reenactment of what it was like to storm the beach at Normandy. But if we fast forward to 1945

55
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:10,567
and eventually the, especially between the Soviet and the US, or I guess I should say

56
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:17,951
all of the allied forces, they are able to win the European front of WWII and then fast forward

57
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,620
to the end of that year. Japan was still fighting pretty ferociously

58
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,796
And so the US, and once again I could make many videos of this, we could debate the ethical

59
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:34,065
implications of this, but the US develops the atomic bomb and ignites one over here in Hiroshima

60
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:40,381
and then a few days later one in Nagasaki and that essentially ends WWII.

61
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:46,233
And so the outcome of WWII is you have two remaining superpowers: you have the Soviet Union

62
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:50,737
and you have the United States.

63
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:56,542
And what happens after that is you have the Cold War. These two huge powers - the Soviet Union

64
00:05:56,542 --> 00:06:01,697
is this Communist country and it's obviously trying to create this Communist sphere of influence

65
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:07,270
a lot of Eastern Europe was falling under Soviet sway, the US - not a Communist country, a very

66
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,682
capitalist country, uh you can imagine. And this is something that gets confused a lot - the

67
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:17,115
Soviet Union was Communist and it was totalitarian. Communism and democracy are not

68
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:19,159
necessarily things that go against each other.

69
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:23,013
But the Soviet Union had neither a capitalist system nor a democracy.

70
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:27,704
It was both Communist and Totalitarian. And when I say Communist I'm talking

71
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:32,951
about no private wealth - the state really owns all private resources.

72
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:37,084
The US on the other hand was hugely capitalist and you can imagine the US did not want

73
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:43,029
any of this Communism business to kind of come to us.

74
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:47,487
You have this major battle that never really erupts into direct conflict

75
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:49,205
between the Soviet Union and the US.

76
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:53,663
It's always done through proxies, through people who are acting on behalf of the US

77
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,150
or the Soviet Union.

78
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,490
You have the Cold War beginning.

79
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,091
And it's called a cold war because it wasn't really a hot war.

80
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:07,131
The US and Soviet Union never really fired bullets at each other.

81
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:11,264
Instead they supported other parties that would fire bullets at the Soviet Union.

82
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:15,862
And the Soviet Union would support other parties that would fire bullets at the US.

83
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:21,945
For the US it was all about stopping Communism. It was all about preventing this domino

84
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:26,264
theory that if one country in a region would fall to Communism, the other countries would.

85
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:31,837
And the US became a bit paranoid - and maybe it was justified, but either way it was very concerned

86
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:37,271
about the spread of Communism. And the first time this really gets tested - and 1950 is an interesting

87
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:42,983
year - because this is the first time (obviously the US had nuclear weapons as of 1945), but

88
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:48,230
in 1950, the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon. So now the Cold War

89
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,942
is starting to get very serious. Both of these adversaries can now nuke each other if they wanted.

90
00:07:53,942 --> 00:08:03,463
And also in 1950, you have Korea. Korea, before WWII was a Japanese colony.

91
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:11,729
But obviously Japan had now lost and so after WWII it was split between North Korea,

92
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,212
which was influenced by the Russians and South Korea, which was influenced by the US.

93
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:19,392
So it was split along the 38th parallel, and I know this is a super small diagram.

94
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:23,896
(We'll go into more detail when we do detailed videos about the Korean War)

95
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:28,819
But in 1950 you have the North Koreans invading the South.

96
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,091
And that started the Korean War. The US sent troops. The North Koreans had China on their side -

97
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:37,271
the Chinese army. The Soviets were also supplying them.

98
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:42,612
But at the end of the day in 1953 you fast forward, it ends up being

99
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:46,933
a little bit of a stalemate because the end result is that the original 38th parallel

100
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:53,664
border gets reinstated. That was the first real conflict of the Cold War.

101
00:08:53,664 --> 00:09:00,723
Notice that there were never US or Soviet troops directly firing at each other.

102
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:05,878
The US was at war with the North Korean and Chinese troops, but they

103
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:11,265
were kind of proxies for the Soviet Union. And at the same time, as you can imagine,

104
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:19,020
because we have these two technically sophisticated adversaries - they both had nuclear weapons -

105
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,293
it became very interesting on who can kind of dominate space.

106
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:29,144
You have the space race developing in 1957. The Soviets are able to

107
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:36,389
launch the first artificial satellite around the Earth. This is Sputnik 1. Some people think

108
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,476
the first Sputnik is the one that had the dog in it, but no, that came a few months later.

109
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:45,213
That was Sputnik 2 (I actually had the picture of the doge here, the dog actually dies

110
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:49,346
but it was alive for a little bit in orbit). So that gets everyone freaked out and the US

111
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:55,200
responds. Then in 1961 you have Yuri Gagarin, he is the first person in space.

112
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,669
The first human being in space. He returns safely. We eventually get up there as well (the US).

113
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:05,848
And then you fast forward all the way to 1969, the US is the first to be on the moon.

114
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:08,711
So you have this space race that is, you know, the two countries really trying

115
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:13,216
to one up each other and at the same time that's happening, you have

116
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:17,287
(and I bring this up because so much happened during his presidency)

117
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:24,532
in 1960 you have John F Kennedy being elected, kind of in the heart

118
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:29,261
of the Cold War. And the other interesting thing is he is the first Catholic president

119
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:29,888
which was, you know, people questioned whether---that by itself was interesting

120
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:32,930
which was---that by itself was interesting

121
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,926
But what was really interesting in his short presidency---

122
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:40,406
he actually became president in '61

123
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:44,841
he was elected in '60, but he became president in '61

124
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:47,728
He had a very short presidency, and he was assassinate in '63.

125
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:50,774
But, a lot happened in that short presidency.

126
00:10:50,774 --> 00:11:01,787
In 1959, right before he became president, you have the Cuban revolution.

127
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:04,156
Cuba became Communist.

128
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:07,806
Fidel Castro takes over; it becomes Communist.

129
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:11,463
So, as you can imagine, the Americans didn't like a Communist

130
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:21,599
state so close to our own borders. So in 1961, we support some ex-cubans---

131
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:27,868
some cuban exiles to try to invade Cuba---and that also can be a whole topic

132
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:32,140
for another video. There's debates between the CIA and the Kennedy Administration

133
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,996
of who is to blame for it being such a failure.

134
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:38,805
But it was a failure. So it was a huge embarrassment to the United States.

135
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:45,863
And from the Communist Revolutionaries' point of view, they kind of viewed this as

136
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:55,337
solidifying their hold of Cuba; it showed they could fend off a counter-revolutionary assault

137
00:11:55,337 --> 00:12:02,884
And then you have in 1962 we have these spy planes and we see that the Soviets are starting to put

138
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:06,785
these ballistic missles in Cuba, which really freaks the United States out because

139
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:09,942
these ballistic missles could reach any part of the United States

140
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:13,008
We actually had similar ones in parts of Europe and Turkey.

141
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:17,071
But we didn't like these things here, so we essentially use our Navy to

142
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:23,433
"blockade" anymore arm shipments to the Soviet Union.

143
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:29,533
So Kennedy has this kind of stand-off with the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missle Crisis in 1962.

144
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:35,264
And most people believe that this was the closet that the United States and the Soviet Union ever got

145
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:40,732
to actually having a war---and, which would have probably turned into a nuclear war.

146
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:43,913
But the standoff eventually got resolved.

147
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:48,312
The Soviet Union eventually agreed to remove their missiles.

148
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:52,203
Well, one, not send anymore missles and dismantle the ones they had already set up.

149
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:56,158
And, (and this wasn't publicly stated at the time) but the United States also agreed

150
00:12:56,158 --> 00:13:02,174
to do the same thing for our missiles that were pointed at the Soviet Union to remove those from Turkey.

151
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:09,246
So the world---at that point in time---had avoided kind of a mutually assured destruction.

152
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:13,402
The whole time that this is happening, remember that the United States is paranoid---

153
00:13:13,402 --> 00:13:17,947
and maybe, justifiably so---(paranoia usually means worried when there's not a cause)

154
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,740
but maybe justifiably worried about the spread of Communism.

155
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,598
You have a situation where in Vietnam.

156
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:31,073
You have Vietnam which is right about...

157
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:36,272
In Vietnam you have the Communists come to power in North Vietnam

158
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:39,479
(this was formerly a French colony).

159
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:48,000
The US, right from the get-go, in the 1950's starts sending advisors to aid the "anti-Communists" in South Vietnam.

160
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,683
In Kennedy's administration the amount of "advisors"---and I should probably put that in quotes

161
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:58,575
because these advisors started becoming much more involved---really grew.

162
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:07,403
And until 1965, the United States started sending its "official" combat troops to fight in Vietnam.

163
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:11,801
And you fast-forward that all the way to 1975---and the reason why this is significant

164
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:16,422
(other than this being one of the more recent major wars that the United States has been in)

165
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,114
it's the first war that the United States kind of unambiguously lost.

166
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:28,914
In 1975, the last presence of the United States left, and essentially Saigon (which was the capital of South Vietnam)

167
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:31,069
fell to the Communists.

168
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:37,203
So I'll leave you there, and we're now essentially in modern history---at least from my point of view

169
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:40,315
because I was born not too long after that.

170
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:42,422
Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.
