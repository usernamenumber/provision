1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,160
In the last couple of videos,
we've gone over the idea that

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,230
the Federal Reserve manages the
money supply by setting a

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,660
target interest rate.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,950
And there might have been the
obvious question circling in

6
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,900
your brain-- why don't they just
manage the money supply

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,620
by instead of setting a target
interest rate, why don't they

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,340
set a target money supply?

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:27,070
They could say we have a target
M0 of-- I don't know--

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,540
$900 billion and they just-- if
it's at $800 billion now,

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,030
they just print that much-- $100
billion dollars more of

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,250
base money or Federal Reserve
deposits or Federal Reserve

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,455
notes and then the M0 will get
to $900 billion and then

14
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:41,760
you'll have the multiplier
effect and more lending will

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,370
take place and then you
will increase the M1.

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,920
So similarly, they could
have a target M1.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,960
They could say we want the M1,
which is the M0 plus checking

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,070
deposit accounts-- so
essentially, anything that can

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,160
be used for money.

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,310
So actual cash, reserve
deposits, or checking accounts

21
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,320
can be used for money because
you can write

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,370
checks against them.

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,890
So they can say, we want that
target to be-- I don't know--

24
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,930
$2 trillion.

25
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,210
They can say, we're
targeting the M2.

26
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,240
M2 is the M1 plus savings
accounts and

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,050
money market accounts.

28
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,060
So they could say,
we're targeting

29
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,010
that to be $8 trillion.

30
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,770
And just so you know,
I actually

31
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,860
looked up these numbers.

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,570
As of at least '05, '06, these
numbers weren't that far off.

33
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,980
The M0 was more like $800
billion, but just

34
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,600
so you get an idea.

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,050
These, are real numbers.

36
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,410
The obvious question is,
why don't they do that?

37
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,890
Why don't they just grow
the money supply?

38
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,180
Maybe one thing they could do,
they could say, our goal is

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,070
for M2 to always be--
50% of GDP, right?

40
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,920
They could say, let's make
it always 50% of GDP.

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,020
So as the economy grows, we just
have to make sure that if

42
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,360
it falls below 50% of GDP, that
we just have to print a

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
little bit more money, then
it'll have a multiplier effect

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,300
and we'll just keep
measuring it.

45
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,540
If it goes a little bit above,
we'll do some open market

46
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,780
operations and sell our
treasuries and take reserves

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,310
out of the banking system.

48
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,150
So that's a completely
legitimate way of thinking

49
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,350
about it-- and actually, there
are some people who do

50
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,360
advocate it this way.

51
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,040
And there is no clear answer to
why they're doing this, but

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,210
I've thought about a little bit
and there's two reasons

53
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,550
that I can think of why this
might make more sense--

54
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,120
although there's a part of me--
and maybe in a future

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,320
video, I'll make an argument
for why actually doing

56
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,970
something like managing the
money supply to 50% of GDP

57
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,530
might actually make a little
bit more sense.

58
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,760
But anyway.

59
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,090
The first reason is kind of one
out of convenience-- that

60
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,920
the short term interest rate
with which banks lend to each

61
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,170
other is just easier to measure
than any of these

62
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,350
money supply things.

63
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,500
If I'm Ben Bernanke and I want
to know what banks are lending

64
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,780
to each other at, I could just
sample the market at that

65
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,480
moment in time.

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,120
I could say, I'm a bank.

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,320
What are you willing
to lend to me at?

68
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,630
They'll say, 5.2%.

69
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,080
They're like, oh, that's a
little bit above our target.

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,550
We have to buy more
treasuries.

71
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,720
So you can get a very real
time notion of where the

72
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,880
market is minute by minute.

73
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,090
You don't have to wait for some
surveys to get completed

74
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,150
or anything like that.

75
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,350
While if you were targeting
actual money supply you would

76
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,040
have to tabulate these fairly
quickly if you wanted real

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,450
time information and that would
just be more of a mess.

78
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,500
To actually calculate the M2,
you'd have to survey the banks

79
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,880
and maybe you could do it with
some IT systems, but you're

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,060
not going to get that real time
information-- or at least

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,650
it would be harder to.

82
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,220
The other reason-- and this is
a little bit more abstract,

83
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,220
but I think it'll make
sense to you.

84
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,520
Let's say it's the
planting season.

85
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,290
I've never been a farmer, but I
think the planting season is

86
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,570
sometime in the spring.

87
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,320
And let's say there's a couple
of farm projects where farmers

88
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,110
need to borrow money
to buy seeds.

89
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:48,270
One of them returns a-- the
farmer will proceed if he can

90
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,960
get lending at 20% or lower
interest rates.

91
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,430
So if someone's willing to lend
him money at 21% interest

92
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,000
rate, he'll be like, no,
that's way too much.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But if he can get money at
19%, he's like, OK, I'll

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,030
borrow the money and I'll buy
the seeds because it will

95
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,420
create so much value that I'll
easily be able to pay back

96
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,450
that interest.

97
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,670
Say there's another farmer
with an 18% project.

98
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,170
So if he gets 18% or lower
interest rates, he'll proceed

99
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,610
with his project.

100
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,380
Let's say there's another farmer
with a-- let's say it's

101
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,270
a 12%-- project.

102
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,880
If he gets funding at 11%, he'll
move forward and he'll

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,740
buy the seeds and he'll
plant them.

104
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,650
Let's say there's a
couple of other

105
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,980
projects in this universe.

106
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,370
Let's say there's
a factory guy.

107
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,710
He's got a really good idea, a
new technology he wants to

108
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,000
invest in and he's going to
move forward building the

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,050
factory if he can get-- I don't
know-- 19% funding.

110
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,260
And let's say there's another
factory guy who

111
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,360
would get 3% funding.

112
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,730
So he's not too confident
about his project.

113
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,680
He thinks this project only
makes sense to move forward if

114
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,650
he can get 3% or
better funding.

115
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,290
So when I say better,
less than 3%.

116
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,630
My phone is ringing,
but I'll ignore it

117
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,470
because I'm on a roll.

118
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,170
And there's another guy who's
really marginal, really shady.

119
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,650
He's got a really
shady project.

120
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,790
He himself is not too
confident in it.

121
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,140
He will only proceed with this
project if he essentially gets

122
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,300
money for free.

123
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,585
So this is the state of affairs
in in the spring or

124
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,140
during the planting season.

125
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,740
So all of these would be
potential consumers of money.

126
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,280
And let's say that this
is the money supply.

127
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,590
Let's say the money supply is
fixed at that moment in time.

128
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,550
So let's say-- I'll draw the
money supply circles so

129
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,390
there's three circles
of money, right?

130
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,420
So essentially the money is
going to be lent to the people

131
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,590
willing to pay the highest
interest rate.

132
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,590
So in this case-- for the sake
of simplicity, we're assuming

133
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,320
all these are kind of the same
amount of money, just not to

134
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,910
make things too complicated.

135
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,260
So in a capitalist system,
the three best projects

136
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,560
would get the money.

137
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,490
And so it'll be this one, this
one, and this one, right?

138
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,380
These three guys will
get the money.

139
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,520
And essentially they're going
to pay the highest interest

140
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,790
rate that the worst among
them is willing to pay.

141
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,330
So this money is going to go
to these three guys at

142
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:24,080
essentially 17.9%, right?

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,780
I'm making a lot of simplifying
assumptions, but I

144
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,710
really just want you to get
the underlying idea.

145
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,170
And these projects, these three
products are not going

146
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,380
to get done.

147
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,830
And you might say, well, it's
good that society didn't

148
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,650
allocate money to this guy and
this guy because these were

149
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,350
shady projects to begin with,
but it's kind of unfortunate.

150
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,460
This was a 12% yield project
that if somehow the capital

151
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,350
was there, we would've gotten a
12% return on society, which

152
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,600
is-- in the big picture of
things, a really good project,

153
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,510
but there just wasn't
enough capital at

154
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,290
that moment in time.

155
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,250
There wasn't enough money at
that moment in time to support

156
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,260
this project.

157
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,270
Fair enough.

158
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,170
But let's say the money supply
stays constant-- or at least

159
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,150
in the medium term over the
course of a year because

160
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,000
that's what the Fed
is targeting.

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,500
So as we get away from the
planting season, these

162
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,750
projects disappear.

163
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,950
   

164
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,550
They're no longer there because
the planting season

165
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,650
isn't there anymore.

166
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,500
And let's say this guy got done,
but let's say there's

167
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,480
another project just
like it that's 19%.

168
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,796
And all of a sudden, since the
planting season's done, none

169
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:26,370
of the farmers want money
anymore, but if you're keeping

170
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,760
the money supply constant,
now which projects are

171
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,170
going to get done?

172
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,580
Well, this good project here is
going to get done, but so

173
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,870
are these two kind of
crappy projects.

174
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,630
And they're going to be lent
at a much lower rate.

175
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,400
The average rate that it gets
lent to is going to be 1% or

176
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,380
2% or something really low.

177
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,790
So you have a situation here
where the money supply did

178
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,050
not-- it wasn't elastic with
the demand and the negative

179
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,380
side effect to society in this
situation is, when people

180
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,040
needed money, we were passing
on good projects that really

181
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,330
should have been done
because these

182
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,970
were really safe projects.

183
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,910
And then later, when the timing
is bad and we keep the

184
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,230
money supply constant, bad
projects will get funded

185
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,590
because there's just so much
money to go around and none of

186
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,980
these people need to use it
that these really crappy

187
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,460
projects that might even be
negative-- remember, these are

188
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,190
what the investor thinks they're
going to get, but

189
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,440
maybe there's a lot of risk
and these end up-- if the

190
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,910
investor thinks they're going to
get a 1% return, maybe they

191
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,580
made a mistake.

192
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,880
Maybe they'll get a -5% return,
in which case we're

193
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,610
going to be destroying wealth.

194
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,610
So this is the problem where
over a medium period of time,

195
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,600
if you hold the money supply
constant, you'll be passing up

196
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,200
on good projects when there's
a lot of demand for them.

197
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,250
And then you'll be investing in
bad projects when there's

198
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,960
not much demand for projects.

199
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,710
On the other hand, if you
had-- let's do the same

200
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,670
scenario over again.

201
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,100
I think I made that a little
messy Let's say you have a

202
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,570
couple farmers again.

203
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,530
Let me draw a line here.

204
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:59,120
So you have that 20%, 18%, 12%,
and then you have the

205
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,780
19%, 3%, and 1%.

206
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,080
Now, if you were managing the
money supply to an interest

207
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,530
rate-- and remember, the
interest rate-- the federal

208
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,870
funds rate, is the rate
that banks lend

209
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,460
to each other, right?

210
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,230
But as we saw, when you inject
reserves into the banking

211
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,370
system, it lowers the rate that
reserves are lent to each

212
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,560
other, but also increases the
lending capacity of banks.

213
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,460
So it increases the
money supply.

214
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,430
And so when you increase the
money supply overall the

215
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,570
lending capacity, you're also
lowering the rate at which

216
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,430
banks lend to projects, right?

217
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,650
You're increasing the
amount of money.

218
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,850
Maybe the projects haven't
changed that much.

219
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,330
So more money chasing the same
number of projects-- the cost

220
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,450
of lending is going
to go down, right?

221
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,220
So let's say the Fed manages
the interest rate in such a

222
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,530
way that the Fed target rate
was 5%, but let's say that

223
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,340
turns into bank lending to
real projects at-- I

224
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,590
don't know-- 8%.

225
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,980
   

226
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,100
So in this case, we're not
fixing the money supply.

227
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,140
We're just adjusting the money
supply in such a way that the

228
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,650
interest rate is fixed.

229
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,670
So now during the planting
season, which products are

230
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,830
going to get funded?

231
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,750
This one, this one, this
one, and this one.

232
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,720
These guys are not going
to get funded.

233
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,480
And then once the planting
season is over, we're still

234
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,550
keeping the interest
rate the same.

235
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,510
Maybe we'll contract the money
supply in order to keep

236
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,360
interest rate-- and of course,
this isn't what

237
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,920
they manage it to.

238
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,550
They manage it to the inter-bank
lending, but it's

239
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,170
all related.

240
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,810
I just want to give you a sense
of why it makes more

241
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,660
sense to manage to
an interest rate.

242
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,090
So once the planting season
is over and some of these

243
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,540
projects aren't really available
as projects-- these

244
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,540
were all the planting projects--
in this situation

245
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,830
when we had a constant money
supply, we would lend to these

246
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,790
crappy projects, but now that
we keep the interest rates

247
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,850
constant or relatively fixed,
still only the good project is

248
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,160
going to get funded and we
don't have to worry about

249
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,320
banks just because they're
chasing yield and they're so

250
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,400
flush with cash that they're
chasing bad projects.

251
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,720
So that's the underlying
rationale, at least from my

252
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,930
point of view, why it makes
sense to manage to an interest

253
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,800
rate as opposed to
a money supply.

254
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,650
It allows the money supply to
expand and contract naturally

255
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,370
in real time according to
market demands for cash.

256
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,190
And by setting the interest
rates, you're essentially

257
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,000
setting the threshold over which
you're willing to let

258
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,510
projects only that meet that
threshold get funded-- and not

259
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,870
products below it that might
somehow waste money.

260
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,820
Anyway, we'll discuss this a lot
more in a lot of different

261
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,330
videos and hit it from different
angles, but I just

262
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,580
wanted to answer those
questions, just so you know

263
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,560
this wasn't some convoluted
crazy thing that they're

264
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,930
doing, although it is a
little bit convoluted.

265
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,410
It's just not that crazy.

266
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,720
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

267
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,000
