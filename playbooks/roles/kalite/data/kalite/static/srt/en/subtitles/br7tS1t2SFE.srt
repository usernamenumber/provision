1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:04,271
A vector is something that has both magnitude and

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,202
direction...magnitude...

3
00:00:07,202 --> 00:00:11,741
and direction. So let's think of an example of what

4
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:13,870
wouldn't and what would be a vector.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,002
So, if someone tells you that something is moving at

6
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:21,682
5 miles per hour. This information by itself is not a vector quantity.

7
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:25,540
It's only...It's only specifying a magnitude

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,269
We don't know what direction this thing is moving 5 miles per hour in.

9
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:33,142
So, this right over here, which is often referred to as a speed...

10
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:37,359
this is a speed...is not a vector quantity just by itself.

11
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,414
This is considered to be a scalar quantity.

12
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:45,269
If we want it to be a vector, we would also have to specify the direction.

13
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:49,539
So, for example, someone might say, "It's moving 5 miles

14
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:53,070
per hour, east." So, let's say it's moving 5 miles per hour

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,070
due east. So, now this combined, 5 miles per hour due east...

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,799
...this is a vector quantity and now we wouldn't call it speed anymore

17
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:08,872
we would call it velocity...So, velocity is a vector. We're specifying the magnitude 5 miles

18
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:12,774
per hour and the direction east. But how

19
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:16,524
can we actually visualize this? So, let's say we're operating

20
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:19,868
in two dimensions. And what's neat about linear algebra is obviously

21
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:24,268
a lot of what applies in two dimensions...we'll extend to three and then even four, five,

22
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:27,871
six...as many dimensions as we want...our brains have trouble visualizing beyond

23
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:32,202
three, but what's neat is we can mathematically deal with beyond three

24
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:34,742
using linear algebra...and we'll see that in

25
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:35,870
future videos.

26
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,736
But let's just go back to our straight, traditional two-dimensional vector

27
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:43,600
right over here. So, one way we could represent it as an

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,015
arrow that is 5 units long. We'll assume that each of our units

29
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:51,608
are unit here as mph. And that's pointed to

30
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:55,607
the right, where we'll say the right is east. So, for example

31
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:59,852
I could start and arrow right over here and I could make its length=5...the

32
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:03,539
length of the arrow specifies the magnitude. So, one...

33
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:06,853
two...three...four...five.

34
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:11,358
And then the direction that the arrow is pointed in, specifies

35
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:15,135
its direction. So, this right over here could

36
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:22,934
represent visually this vector. If we say that the horizontal axis is, say, east or that the positive

37
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,871
horizontal direction is moving in the east, this would be west, that would be north and then

38
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:30,940
that would be south. Now, what's interesting about vectors is that we only

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,771
care about the magnitude and the direction. We don't necessarily

40
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:38,536
care where we start...where we place it...when we thing of it visually like this.

41
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:42,203
So, for example, this would be the exact same vector, or would be equivalent vector

42
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:46,688
to this. This vector has the same length, so it has

43
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:50,142
the same magnitude...has a length of five. And its direction is also

44
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:54,274
due east. So, these two vectors are equivalent. Now, one thing

45
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,803
that you might say is, "Well, that's fair enough, but how do we represent it with a little bit more mathematical

46
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:02,203
notations. We don't have to draw it every time and we could start performing operations on it."

47
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:06,142
Well the typical way, 1.if you want a variable to represent a vector

48
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:10,355
is usually a lower case letter. If you have...if you're publishing a book,

49
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:14,024
you can bold it. But't when you're doing it in your notebook, you would typically put a little

50
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:18,202
arrow on top of it. And you usually...there're several ways that you could do it

51
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:19,202
You could say

52
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:21,936
'Hey, 5 miles per hour, east.' But that doesn't feel like you can really operate on

53
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:25,936
that easily. The typical way is to specify...if you're in two

54
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:29,773
dimensions...to specify two numbers that tell you how much is this

55
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:33,869
vector moving in each of these dimensions. So,

56
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:38,136
for example, this one only moves in the horizontal dimension and so, we'll put a

57
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:41,026
horizontal dimension first. So, you might call this vector:

58
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:46,022
(5,0). It's moving 5...positive 5

59
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:49,191
in the horizontal direction and it's not moving at all

60
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:53,469
in the vertical direction. And the notation might change. You might also see

61
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:57,611
notation and actually in a linear algebra context, it's more typical to write it as a

62
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:00,936
column vector like this. Five...Zero...

63
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:06,002
Once again, The first coordinate represents how much we're moving in the horizontal

64
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:09,069
direction and the second coordinate represents how

65
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:13,023
much are we moving in the

66
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:17,538
vertical direction. Now, this one isn't that interesting. You could have other

67
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:21,409
vectors. You can have a vector that looks like this...that's moving...let's say it's moving

68
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:23,851
3 in the horizontal direction and

69
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:29,803
+4...so...one, two, three, four...in

70
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,609
the vertical direction. So, let me see, it might look something like

71
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:37,207
this. So, this could be another

72
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:41,074
vector right over here. May be, we call this vector...

73
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:44,940
Vector A; and once I wanna specify that it is a vector

74
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,277
and you see here that if you were to break it down in its...

75
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:52,805
in the horizontal direction...it is moving

76
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:56,942
three or it's shifting

77
00:04:56,942 --> 00:05:02,203
three in the horizontal direction and it's shifting four...positive four...

78
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:05,275
in the vertical direction. And we get that by literally thinking about

79
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:09,024
how much we're moving up and how much we're moving to the right when

80
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:12,609
we start at the end of the arrow(we start at the tail of the arrow and go towards its head) and go to the front of it

81
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:15,538
So, this vector might be specified as

82
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:19,360
(3,4)

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,691
And you could use the Pythagorean theorem to figure out the actual length of this

84
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,108
vector and you will see 'cause this is a 3-4-5 triangle, that this actually

85
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:32,361
has a magnitude of five. And as we study more

86
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:36,743
and more linear algebra, we're going to start extending these to multiple dimensions.

87
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:40,075
Obviously, we can visualize up to 3-dimensions...and four dimensions become more

88
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:44,107
abstract. And that's why this type of a notations is useful because it's very hard to draw

89
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:48,107
a 4, 5 or 20 dimensional arrow, like this.
