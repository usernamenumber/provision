1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:08,255
The whole point of the immune
system is to keep out shady

2
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:11,105
things from your body-- or, if
they get in, to kill them.

3
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:15,800
So those shady things would
include shady proteins that

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:23,258
can do damage to your body,
viruses, bacteria, even

5
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:31,535
eukaryotic parasites,
and then even fungi.

6
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:35,135
So all sorts of things that if
they were to enter your body,

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,343
they would cause some
form of disease.

8
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:41,875
These are collectively
called pathogens.

9
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,445
So the whole point of the immune
system is, on a first

10
00:00:44,507 --> 00:00:47,802
line of defense, keep these
things out-- and then if they

11
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:51,608
were to get into your body, to
kill and eliminate them from

12
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,739
our system so that we don't
get sick and so

13
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,351
that we don't die.

14
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:57,422
So I already just mentioned that
there's kind of two lines

15
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,735
of defense and even with
those, there's kind of

16
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,477
subclassifications.

17
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:03,875
The first line of defense-- I'll
just call that the first

18
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:10,176
line-- which is essentially just
to keep things out-- keep

19
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:13,033
all of these pathogens out.

20
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:14,483
And there's some obvious ones.

21
00:01:14,528 --> 00:01:15,998
There's our skin.

22
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:19,521
Our skin keeps pathogens out and
actually even the oils on

23
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:22,416
our skin are a little bit more
acidic and it's hard for some

24
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:27,221
types of bacteria to thrive in
that type of environment.

25
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:34,404
You have your mucus membranes
and in the mucous, there's

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,764
there's some chemicals that
maybe make it a little bit

27
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,536
more difficult for bacteria
to survive.

28
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:43,173
And then you even have acidic
environments like

29
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:48,209
your stomach acid.

30
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,289
You might not view your stomach
as the outside of you,

31
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:53,876
but it fundamentally is.

32
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:56,469
Your whole digestive tract,
which I'll make videos on in

33
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:59,009
the near future, is really
on the outside of you.

34
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,137
You can simply model really most
vertebrate bodies as kind

35
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:07,466
of a doughnut our digestive
tract is the

36
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:09,268
inside of the doughnut.

37
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:14,136
So stomach acid is on the
outside of our real bodies and

38
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:16,956
you can imagine, that's a hard
environment for a lot of these

39
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:19,142
pathogens to survive in.

40
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:21,207
So that's the first line of
defense, but we know that

41
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,807
that's not good enough, that
sometimes these things can get

42
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:28,004
into our bodies, and there we
have to start thinking about

43
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,006
the second line of defense.

44
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:45,268
What do we do once things are
actually in our body?

45
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:48,543
And here, in both the first and
second line, I'm talking

46
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,809
about non-specific immunity--
and this is going to make a

47
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:54,136
lot of sense when we start
talking about specific

48
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:55,469
immunities.

49
00:02:55,469 --> 00:03:00,997
So both of these are
non-specific.

50
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:03,826
And when I say non-specific--
or you can also call them

51
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:09,536
innate-- it means that they
just generally respond to

52
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:11,668
things that appear bad.

53
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:14,130
They don't remember the bad
things that came before.

54
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,135
They don't respond to a
particular type of virus or a

55
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:20,330
particular-- well, they do
respond to every type of virus

56
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,201
or every type of bacteria, but
they don't say, this is virus

57
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,742
type A, B, C, or this is
bacteria type A, B, C.

58
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:28,329
They just say, this
is a virus.

59
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,261
Let me get rid of it, or
let me not let it in.

60
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:31,450
This is a bacteria.

61
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,516
Let me get rid of it or
let me not let it in.

62
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:37,197
It doesn't know what type of
bacteria it's dealing with.

63
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:39,398
So this is all the
non-specific or

64
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:41,864
innate immune system.

65
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:44,248
And we'll go into a lot of
detail on the specific immune

66
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:46,243
system because you can imagine,
it becomes very

67
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:48,752
complicated or interesting when
you start thinking about

68
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:51,863
your body somehow remembering a
virus that it's seen before

69
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:54,000
and being able to respond better
to that virus or that

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,332
bacteria or that protein the
second time it sees it.

71
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:59,597
So we're dealing with
non-specific in this case.

72
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:02,509
And the the second line of your
non-specific immunity,

73
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:04,854
there are two things.

74
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:06,407
One is an inflammatory
response.

75
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,056
And I'm going to do a whole
video on this, but in general,

76
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:22,017
we've all experienced
inflammatory responses.

77
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:26,250
When you see blood flowing to a
certain part of an area and

78
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,182
you see there's pus and
there's-- and I'm going to go

79
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:30,312
into a lot more detail on what
an inflammatory response

80
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,144
actually is, but that's one of
your-- and what it really is

81
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:37,479
doing is bringing blood and
bringing cells that can fight

82
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,644
whatever type of infection you
have. It's bringing them to

83
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:45,188
the site where maybe you got a
cut or maybe where a lot of

84
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:47,561
the bacteria or whatever
the pathogen is.

85
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,981
So inflammatory response is all
about bringing fluid and

86
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,225
fighters to the fight.

87
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:55,640
So, bringing stuff to the fight.

88
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,230
I'm going to do a whole
video on that.

89
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:05,221
Bringing stuff to the fight, bringing weapons to the fight.

90
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:10,249
But the byproduct is, that part
of your tissue or that

91
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:12,395
part of you body gets inflamed--
a lot of fluid

92
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:17,029
there, a lot of byproducts of
the battle that goes on there.

93
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,135
We'll do a whole
video on that.

94
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:20,449
And the other second line of
defense is, and it's actually

95
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:24,295
part of the inflammatory
response-- are phagocytosis or

96
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,889
phagocytes.

97
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,122
And really, what I want to do
over the rest of this video is

98
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,455
talk in a little bit more
detail about phagocytes

99
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:37,181
because once we understand what
phagocytes do, that's a

100
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:41,920
pretty good building block for
going into the specific immune

101
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,394
system-- and actually, it'll
help lead into the discussion

102
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:48,315
on the inflammatory response as
well because phagocytes are

103
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:51,920
really part of the inflammatory
response.

104
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,561
So phagocytes are just
a class of cell

105
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:56,651
that can eat up pathogens.

106
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:59,149
They can eat up other things
really, but when we talk about

107
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:01,315
the immune system, we're talking
about pathogens.

108
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:04,979
So let's say that this is
a phagocyte right here.

109
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,978
This is a phagocyte
right there.

110
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:09,685
It has some kind of a
nucleus, whatever.

111
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:12,404
I don't have to focus on the
inside of the phagocyte.

112
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,245
It's a traditional eukaryotic
cell, but what I want to do is

113
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:20,914
see what happens when a
phagocyte encounters a foreign

114
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,863
particle or a foreign
bacteria.

115
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,979
So let me say this is a foreign
bacteria right here.

116
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,116
So the phagocyte, we've already
said, is non-specific.

117
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:32,727
What it does is, it has
receptors that respond to just

118
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,344
things that it knows are bad.

119
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,847
You could imagine these
are super sensors.

120
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:45,746
Maybe these are super sensors
for bacteria.

121
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:47,987
The bacteria have proteins on
their surface that maybe look

122
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:49,003
something like that.

123
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:50,437
Obviously they don't look
exactly like that.

124
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:53,209
I'm just drawing them as kind
of a Y and a triangle so you

125
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:54,540
can see that they fit.

126
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:59,801
But once these two guys
connect-- let me draw the

127
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:02,266
situation where they
have connected.

128
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03,600
So this is the bacteria.

129
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:04,683
This is the pathogen.

130
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:06,697
And it's really the same idea
with a virus or any

131
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:07,886
other type of thing.

132
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,201
And we'll actually see in future
videos that these guys

133
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:13,139
can actually be tagged by other
molecules, which makes

134
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,332
these phagocytes want to
attack them even more.

135
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:21,138
Once they're bonded--
that's my bacteria,

136
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:23,407
the invading pathogen.

137
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:25,880
And now it is bonded.

138
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,066
It has triggered the receptor
on this phagocyte.

139
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:33,530
This phagocyte will start to
engulf-- it'll wrap around

140
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:44,333
this pathogen.

141
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:50,905
And these two ends are
eventually going to meet.

142
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,983
But then once these two meet,
what's it going to look like?

143
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:09,387
Then all of a sudden, that
bacteria is going to be

144
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:10,719
completely engulfed.

145
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,197
It's going to be inside
of the cell.

146
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:15,903
So now the cell-- once these
two ends meet and these

147
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:19,268
membranes merge, then this guy
is going to be in his own

148
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:21,607
little membrane bubble-- or you
can almost imagine, it's

149
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:24,268
in its own little vesicle.

150
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:27,837
So this is the pathogen, the
bacteria in this case-- but

151
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:31,828
phagocytosis-- the process is
completely identical in terms

152
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:33,416
of how it engulfs things.

153
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:37,532
If it was a virus or some type
of other foreign protein or

154
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:42,084
any type of really foreign
molecule-- actually, sometimes

155
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:43,669
it doesn't even occur
to foreign stuff.

156
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,501
It can occur to dying molecules
that are not

157
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:49,609
foreign, that just need
to be cleared out.

158
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,417
But we'll just focus on the
immune system, on foreign

159
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:54,210
things right now.

160
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:59,196
So this membrane right here will
completely merge and go

161
00:08:59,196 --> 00:09:01,794
around this guy like this.

162
00:09:01,794 --> 00:09:03,683
And of course, you had your
receptors and who knows if

163
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:05,273
they're still there.

164
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:07,801
By the time-- let's just draw
them there so you see that

165
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:08,838
that part is that part.

166
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:11,744
But once it's fully engulfed,
this thing is called a

167
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:20,332
phagosome, which is really
just a vesicle that contains

168
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:23,000
that foreign particle that
you want to get rid of.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And then other fluid or vesicles
that contain things

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,667
that can eat up this phagosome--
so let's say that

171
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:43,310
this is some vesicle that
contains things-- lysozymes

172
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:50,935
and it contains really reactive
species of oxygen.

173
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:52,662
And if this comes in contact
with, really, almost any

174
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:55,408
biological compound, it's
going to do some damage.

175
00:09:55,461 --> 00:10:00,438
But once the pathogen is
completely merged inside the cell,

176
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:06,369
this little package will
merge over here and it will

177
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:11,289
dump its contents into this
phagosome, into this vesicle

178
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:15,553
containing the pathogen,
and then break it up.

179
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:19,062
It's essentially digesting it.

180
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:21,475
So obviously the first role is,
it just got it out of the

181
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:22,966
way and it killed it.

182
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:25,244
And then the second role-- and
I'm just going to give a

183
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:26,431
little tidbit right here.

184
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,914
We're going to do it in a lot
more detail in future videos.

185
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:33,033
It breaks it up.

186
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,670
So now the thing is
all broken up.

187
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:49,780
So that thing is broken up into
constituent proteins and

188
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,668
another molecules.

189
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:57,601
And then what the phagocyte
does-- it'll actually take

190
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:02,082
some subset of these
molecules, some

191
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:03,068
subset of the proteins.

192
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:03,983
It'll break them out.

193
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:06,585
Proteins are just sequences
of amino acids.

194
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:08,459
Normally when people say
proteins, they're talking

195
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,602
about long sequences
of amino acids.

196
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:13,522
When people talk about short
sequences of amino acids or a

197
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:17,038
protein that's broken up a lot,
they refer to it as a

198
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:17,872
peptide chain.

199
00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:20,544
A peptide chain is a shorter
chain of amino acids.

200
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:22,944
So this guy will take some
special peptide chains, some

201
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:28,275
special pieces from the thing it
just killed, attach them to

202
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:30,362
some other proteins.

203
00:11:30,362 --> 00:11:37,710
So it'll take maybe a little
piece of this bacteria right

204
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:45,100
now, attach it to other protein,
which is called a

205
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,163
major histocompatibility
complex-- and if we're talking

206
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:52,721
about phagocytes, this will be
a major histocompatibility

207
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:54,920
complex type II.

208
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,146
That's a mouthful of words.

209
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:01,753
It sounds very-- a strange word,
but we're going to see

210
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:02,584
this a lot.

211
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:17,949
So this is major histocompatibility complex

212
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:20,784
They abbreviate it MHC

213
00:12:20,784 --> 00:12:24,367
This is a protein and it bonds
with this peptide that was

214
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:27,532
kind of chunked off or digested
off of this invading

215
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:32,949
pathogen and then this phagocyte
will then present it

216
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:34,396
onto its membrane.

217
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:37,467
So this combination-- the
complex of the MHC-- in this

218
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:41,112
case, it's going to be
an MHC II protein.

219
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:46,735
We're going to talk about
Type I. in the future.

220
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:50,124
It's going to take this complex
and then present it on

221
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:53,831
its surface.

222
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:05,024
And the reason why I'm going
through all this pain of

223
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:06,935
explaining this process-- you're
like, hey, we already

224
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:08,464
got rid of the thing
and killed it.

225
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:11,533
Why is Sal worried about what
we do with the peptides?

226
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:14,271
This is crucial to our immune
system because we'll see other

227
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,737
specific parts of our
immune system.

228
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:19,678
Remember, so far everything
is non-specific.

229
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:21,531
This guy just said, this
is an invader.

230
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:23,337
It doesn't know the type
of an invader.

231
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,130
It just says, hey, let me bond
to this thing and kill it.

232
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:30,531
It's one of these things that I
know are foreign to my body.

233
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:33,865
So it kills it, but now it can
leave it on its surface and

234
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:36,604
now the specific parts, the
parts that actually have

235
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:40,596
memory and attack specific
things, can say, gee, Mr.

236
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:42,665
Phagocyte, look, you've
killed something.

237
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:46,270
Let me see if I have some
specific reactions that can be

238
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,533
triggered by this thing that
you're presenting.

239
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,799
So, many phagocytes
are also called

240
00:13:50,799 --> 00:14:00,189
antigen presenting cells.

241
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:03,133
And I'm going to go into more
detail on what exactly an

242
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,941
antigen is.

243
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:06,800
I called this thing
a pathogen.

244
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,131
An antigen is essentially-- you
can view it as a protein

245
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:15,350
or a peptide chain that will
trigger or that can be dealt

246
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:16,989
with within the immune system.

247
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,923
I'll be a little bit-- the
specific immune system.

248
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:22,337
And I'm going to be a little bit
more nuanced about it when

249
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:24,197
I talk-- I'll make a whole
video on antigens and

250
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,597
antibodies, but right now you
can just view it as a peptide

251
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:29,658
chain right there.

252
00:14:29,658 --> 00:14:31,863
An antigen is just a protein
or part of a protein.

253
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:34,201
So this is presenting an antigen
on its surface that

254
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:37,422
can later be used
by other parts.

255
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:41,862
Now, the one thing that-- there
are many, many types of

256
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:42,858
phagocytes.

257
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:45,499
And just to give you-- just so
when you see different words,

258
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:48,331
you don't get confused by the
different types of phagocytes.

259
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:51,201
I'll do a little review
of those right now.

260
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:54,400
You have neutrophils.

261
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:58,452
These are actually the most
common of the phagocytes.

262
00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:01,274
And these are the fast and
numerous respondors.

263
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:11,109
So these get to a location
of infection very fast.

264
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:14,120
Phagocytes don't necessarily
just have to kill in this way.

265
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,643
I mean, they're called
phagocytes because they engulf

266
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,715
this way, but we'll in future
videos talk about other ways

267
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,117
that they can release chemicals
or even DNA nets to

268
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:23,960
ensnare pathogens,
but neutrophils

269
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,581
are fast and abundant.

270
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:30,656
And then you have macrophages,
which are-- on some level,

271
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:32,915
they're the most versatile and
do the heavy lifting, but

272
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:34,658
they're also phagocytes.

273
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:38,982
And then you dendritic cells.

274
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:40,912
And when you first see the
word dendritic cell, you

275
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:42,644
think, hey, does this somehow
relate to dendrites of the

276
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:43,943
nervous system?

277
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:50,400
And no, they have nothing to
do with the nervous system.

278
00:15:52,815 --> 00:15:54,269
The reason why they're called
dendritic cells is because

279
00:15:54,269 --> 00:16:03,588
they look like they
have dendrites.

280
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,855
So they look like neurons on
some level, but they don't

281
00:16:05,855 --> 00:16:08,235
participate in the nervous
system at all.

282
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:11,916
And these tend to be the best
activators of the specific

283
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,480
immune system that we'll talk
about in future videos.

284
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,982
So anyway, I'll leave you there
and we'll talk more

285
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:20,000
about all of this in the
next few videos.
