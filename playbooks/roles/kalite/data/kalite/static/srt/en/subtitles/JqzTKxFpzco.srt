1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,460
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:07,040
We are on problem number 10.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,420
I'm trying to do as many
problems as possible, because

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:09,935
today is Thanksgiving.

6
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:12,750
And I want to build up an
appetite to really take down

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,650
that turkey.

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,130
Anyway, they say, what is the
coordinate of the point on a

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,140
number line that is exactly
halfway between the points

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,800
with coordinates 53 and 62?

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,840
So the point that's halfway
between those two is just

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,980
going to be the average
of these two points.

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,840
So what's the average?

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,910
It's 53 plus 62 over 2.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,590
And that's what?

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:47,460
5 plus 6 is 111,
so it's 115/2.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,240
That equals 57.5.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,080
So that's the answer.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,980
And this is one of those ones
we have to fill it in.

20
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,350
57.5 is half way between
the two.

21
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,900
And at first, I was
little taken aback

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,270
because of the decimal.

23
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,700
I was thinking maybe is an
integer number line.

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,450
But they don't say that.

25
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,580
So on a regular number line,
you can have decimals.

26
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,220
So this is the point
that is exactly

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,270
halfway between the two.

28
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,180
This is the coordinate
of the point.

29
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,780
Number 11.

30
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,100
A certain triangle has
two angles that

31
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,750
have the same measure.

32
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,730
If the lengths of the two sides
of the triangle are 50

33
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,610
and 30, what is the least
possible value for the

34
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,160
perimeter of the triangle?

35
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,555
All right, so we've
got a triangle.

36
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:33,120
   

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,740
And we know that two
of these sides are

38
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,570
the same angle, right?

39
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,270
And we know, from geometry, if
the two base angles are the

40
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,190
same, then that means that these
two sides are going to

41
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,670
be the same.

42
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,870
And they tell us that two of
the sides are 50 and 30.

43
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,610
So either this could be 50
and this could be 30.

44
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,240
Or this could be 30 and
this could be 50.

45
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,990
Because this can't
be 50 and 30.

46
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,470
These have to be
the same thing.

47
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,080
So we want to know the
least possible

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,590
value of the perimeter.

49
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,080
So if we want the smallest
possible value for the

50
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,385
perimeter, we want
more 30 sides and

51
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:09,440
less 50 sides, right?

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,810
So why don't we make
this side 30?

53
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,970
Because then, this side
will be 30, and this

54
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,600
side will be 50.

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
And the other option would
have been to do this.

56
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,190
50, 50, and 30.

57
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,010
But clearly, this would have
had a larger perimeter,

58
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,300
because we would have
used 50 twice

59
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,790
instead of using 30 twice.

60
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,170
So this has a smaller
perimeter.

61
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,860
And what is the perimeter?

62
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,650
It's 60 plus 50.

63
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,230
It's 110.

64
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,920
That is the smallest perimeter
we could have.

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,170
Next problem.

66
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,750
   

67
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,310
Problem number 12.

68
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,695
I don't want to use
the whiteboard.

69
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,460
There's something psychological
about a

70
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,020
blackboard, I think.

71
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,430
It makes it more engaging.

72
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:59,380
All right, if x squared minus y
squared is equal to 77, and

73
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,550
x plus y is equal to 11,
what is the value of x?

74
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,490
So this is something that some
people-- oh my God, I've got a

75
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,600
system soon. of equations.

76
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,650
Or I've got a quadratic.

77
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,110
What is it?

78
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,290
All you have to do
is factor this.

79
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,850
What is x squared
minus y squared?

80
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,410
Well, a squared minus b
squared is, a plus b

81
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,410
times a minus b.

82
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,280
Or, in this case, x squared
minus y squared, that's just x

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,880
plus y times x minus
y is equal to 77.

84
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,960
And the biggest clue on why you
can do that immediately,

85
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,770
is that they told you what
x plus y is, right?

86
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,680
So we know that x
plus y is 11.

87
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,310
So 11 times x minus
y is equal to 77.

88
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,776
So now we know, divide
both sides by 11.

89
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:47,415
x minus why is equal
to 7, right?

90
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:51,310
   

91
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,490
Now, we have a very

92
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,040
straightforward system of equations.

93
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,610
And we want to solve
for x, right?

94
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,860
So we can let the
y's cancel out.

95
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,370
Let's take that top one down
here and just rewrite it.

96
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,250
x plus y is equal to 11.

97
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,290
Add the two equations.

98
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,690
x plus x is 2x.

99
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,500
Minus y plus y is 0.

100
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,330
y is equal to 18, right?

101
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,360
7 plus 11 is 18.

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,640
2x is equal to 18.

103
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,120
x is equal to 9 Done.

104
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,370
Next problem.

105
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,190
   

106
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,595
OK, we are on problem
number 13.

107
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:34,500
Tamara cut a circular pizza into
wedge shaped pieces, one

108
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,030
of which is shown above.

109
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,010
The tip of each piece is at
the center of the pizza.

110
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,820
And the angle of the tip is
always greater than 20

111
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,870
degrees, but less
than 30 degrees.

112
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:49,980
OK, what is one possible value
for the number of pieces into

113
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,120
which the pizza is cut?

114
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,210
OK, so this is interesting.

115
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,270
So we have a pizza pie, although
it could just be a

116
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,730
regular pie.

117
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,300
And each of her slices
goes to the center.

118
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:13,540
   

119
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,300
And this angle right here--
so let's call it theta.

120
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:27,486
It's going to be-- it's greater
than 20 degrees.

121
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:31,800
And it's less than 30
degrees, right?

122
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,760
Well, let me ask a question.

123
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,520
If theta was 20 degrees,
how many slices

124
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,950
could she have cut?

125
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,710
Well, there's 360 degrees
in a circle, right?

126
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,430
   

127
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,260
So if every slice is 20
degrees-- Well, 20 goes into

128
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,930
360 how many times?

129
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,550
20 goes into 360,
18 times, right?

130
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,390
2 into 36 goes 18 times.

131
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,740
So if every slice is 20 degrees,
it'd be 18 slices.

132
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,490
Similarly, if every slice was
30 degrees-- 30 degrees goes

133
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,100
into 360, how many times?

134
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,560
Well, it goes into it 12 times.

135
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,566
12 slices.

136
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:13,060
you

137
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,760
So we know that the slices
are larger than 20 and

138
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,090
less than 30, right?

139
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:25,080
So the slices are going
to be greater than 12

140
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,680
and less than 18.

141
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,860
And so you, literally,
can pick any number.

142
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:37,690
The answer could be 13, 14,
15, 16, or 17 slices.

143
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,520
Any of those numbers would be
a suitably correct answer.

144
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
That sometimes confuses
people, but

145
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,990
you should be confident.

146
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,330
Any of these numbers that
you put down will work.

147
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,140
Maybe you want to put the
middle one just to be

148
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,570
comfortable.

149
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,590
I think that would be
a 25 degree slice.

150
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,840
Next problem.

151
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,820
   

152
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,670
14.

153
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:09,962
We have this sequence a,
3a, dot, dot, dot.

154
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,212
[SNEEZES]

155
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:15,160
   

156
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,832
The first term in the
sequence above is a.

157
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:20,840
I just went for a hike at a
place called Windy Hill, and

158
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,980
it was freezing.

159
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,560
The first term in the sequence
above is a, and each term

160
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,130
after the first is 3 times
the preceding term.

161
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,370
If the sum of the first five
terms, is 605, what is the

162
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,180
value of a?

163
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,330
So the first five terms-- well,
that's just going to be

164
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:45,965
a, 3a, and then the next
one's going to be 9a.

165
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,336
The next one is going
to be 27a.

166
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,100
The next one is going
to be 81a, right?

167
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,920
That's the first five terms.
So you add them all up.

168
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,430
3 plus 9 is 12.

169
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,800
This is where I always
mess up.

170
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,390
3 plus 9 is 12.

171
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:04,530
12 plus 27 is 39.

172
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:12,960
39 plus 81-- 9 plus 1 is 10.

173
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,150
And then 1 plus 3 is 120.

174
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,830
So that equals 120a.

175
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,690
So these are the first
five terms, right?

176
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,530
Each one is 3 times
the preceding one.

177
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,850
And the sum of these
is equal to 605.

178
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,330
What is the value of a?

179
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,650
a is equal to 605/120.

180
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,289
And let's see, can
we simplify this?

181
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:47,300
Sure, if we divide the top and
the bottom by five, how many

182
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,610
times does 5 goes into 120?

183
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,950
It goes into it 24 times.

184
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,440
Are these divisible by 3?

185
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,160
No.

186
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,170
I think that's in simplest
terms, because you can't

187
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,960
divide by 2.

188
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,500
Can't divide by 3.

189
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,460
121 times 5 is 605.

190
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,940
So I think that is the simplest
form that you can do

191
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,130
this problem.

192
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,100
I'm running out of time.

193
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,350
So I will wait to
do next the next

194
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,400
problem in the next video.

195
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,650

196
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:19,800
