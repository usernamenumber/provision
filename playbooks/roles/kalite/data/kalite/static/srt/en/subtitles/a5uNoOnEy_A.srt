1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
In this video, we're going to
a couple of warm-up solving

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,750
equations problems. And you'll
see these require several

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,855
steps, maybe a little bit more
than the ones that we've done

5
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:09,710
in the previous video.

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,110
And then we'll do a word problem
that applies our

7
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,030
equation-solving capabilities.

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,640
So here we have 7 times w plus
20, minus w, is equal to 5.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,220
Let's see if we can
solve this.

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,870
And like all things, there's
multiple ways to solve these.

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,210
I'll just solve the way that
seems most natural to me.

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,890
So one thing I like to do, is
I like to distribute the

13
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,610
numbers out.

14
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,950
Because if I distribute the
numbers out, I get a 7w, and

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,710
then I can subtract
w from there.

16
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,110
So maybe I can merge the
w terms somehow.

17
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:46,620
So this 7w plus 20 I can rewrite
as 7w plus 7 times 20.

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,080
Remember, distributive
properties.

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,140
So plus 140.

20
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,560
And then we have this minus
w is equal to 5.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,070
I just rewrote this
part right here.

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,970
I just distributed the 7.

23
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,430
And now, just like I talked
about, we can merge-- We can

24
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,030
take 7w, and from that,
we can subtract a w.

25
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,940
So if you take those two
terms, you get 6w.

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,640
If I have 7 of something, and
I take away 1 of that

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,770
something, I have 6
of that something.

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:21,530
So I have 6w plus 140
is equal to 5.

29
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,410
   

30
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,470
Now, I want get rid
of this 140.

31
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,070
Because then I'll have 6w is
equaling to something, and

32
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,920
I'll be able divide by
6, and all of that.

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,770
So to get rid of 140, I can
subtract 140 from both sides

34
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,030
of the equation.

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,700
And I'll do it in pink.

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,210
Minus 140.

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,510
So I'm just subtracting
140 from both

38
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,150
sides of this equation.

39
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,450
If something equals something,
something minus 140 is going

40
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,390
to equal something minus 140.

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,130
Whatever you do to one side,
you've got to do

42
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,470
to the other side.

43
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,680
So the whole point here was for
these two to cancel out.

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,370
You're left with the left side,
which is 6w is equal to

45
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,040
5 minus 140.

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,160
Well, that's negative 135.

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,120
And now we can divide both sides
of this equation by 6,

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,330
which is equivalent to
multiplying by 1/6, and you

49
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:22,820
get w is equal to, let's see,
negative 135 over 6.

50
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,320
Let's see, is there any place
to simplify this anymore?

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,580
Let's see.

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,850
This isn't divisible by 2,
and it also doesn't look

53
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,060
divisible by 3.

54
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,000
So this looks like we are
done with the problem.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,030
And you can verify.

56
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,490
Actually let's verify, because
it's kind of a

57
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,470
strange-looking-- Let's verify
that this is the answer.

58
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:49,640
So 7 times negative 135 over
6-- that's our solution

59
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,700
for w --plus 20.

60
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,810
Instead of 20, I'm going to
write plus 120 over 6.

61
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,690
20 is the same thing as
120 over 6, right?

62
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,940
Minus w.

63
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,880
   

64
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,360
So w is negative 135 over 6.

65
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,970
So subtracting a negative
becomes

66
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,630
adding a positive, right?

67
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,880
So let's see what happens.

68
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:22,450
This becomes 7 times-- Let's
see, negative 135 plus 120 is

69
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:32,930
negative 15 over 6
plus 135 over 6.

70
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,700
Let's see what we get here.

71
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,330
So then we get 7 times 15.

72
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,260
So let me go over here.

73
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,830
What is 7 times 15?

74
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,780
It's 70 plus 35.

75
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:50,200
So it's negative 105 over 6.

76
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,630
That is that right there.

77
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,780
Plus 135 over 6.

78
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,160
What does that become?

79
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,090
This becomes 30 over 6,
which is equal to 5.

80
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,560
Which is exactly what it
needed to be equal to.

81
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,930
It's equal to 5, so we
got the right answer.

82
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,630
My spider sense was wrong.

83
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,480
We did it correctly, even though
we got this strange

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,230
looking answer.

85
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,900
So now let's do this problem.

86
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,769
So once again, I like to
distribute out the 9.

87
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,156
Actually, we don't have
to distribute it out.

88
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:21,220
There's multiple ways
to do this.

89
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,380
Maybe we'll do it both ways.

90
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,200
So the first way I like to do it
is to distribute out the 9,

91
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,020
so I don't have to deal
with fractions.

92
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,040
So you get 9x minus 18. just
distributed the 9.

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,770
Is equal to 3x plus 3.

94
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,370
Now we want to get the x-terms
together somehow.

95
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,830
Let's get them together
on the left-hand side.

96
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,000
So let's get rid of this 3x
on the right-hand side.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,960
And the best way to get rid of
it is to subtract 3x from the

98
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,820
right-hand side.

99
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,100
But if we do it from the
right-hand side, we have to do

100
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,650
it from the left-hand
side, as well.

101
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,600
So I'm subtracting 3x
from both sides.

102
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,280
The left-hand side, 9x minus 3x
is equal to 6x, and then,

103
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,690
of course, you have your minus
18 is equal to 3x minus 3x.

104
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,800
That just disappears, those
cancel out, and you just have

105
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,670
the 3 left over.

106
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,920
Now there's multiple ways
you could do this.

107
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,040
I mean, one fun thing-- Well,
let me just do it the most

108
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
traditional way.

109
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,220
We could add 18 to both sides so
that the 18 disappears from

110
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,460
the left-hand side.

111
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,410
So then you are left with 6x--
these two guys cancel out --is

112
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,800
equal to 3 plus 18,
which is 21.

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,540
Divide both sides by 6, you get
x is equal to 21 over 6,

114
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,030
or if you divide the numerator
and the denominator by 3, you

115
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,060
get 7 over 2.

116
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,970
And you are done.

117
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,180
Now, I said that there's
multiple

118
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,380
ways to do this problem.

119
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,460
Let me do it another
way here in orange.

120
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,900
So you have 9 times x minus
2 is equal to 3x plus 3.

121
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,520
Well, I see a 9,
I see some 3's.

122
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,600
What if I just divide both sides
of this equation by 3?

123
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,400
So if I divide that side by 3,
and I divide all of these

124
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,990
terms by 3.

125
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,200
What do I get?

126
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:16,120
This becomes 3 times x minus
2 is equal to x plus 1.

127
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,240
Maybe at this point, if I want,
I could distribute this.

128
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,390
So this becomes 3x minus
6 is equal to x plus 1.

129
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,720
I could subtract x from both
sides of this equation, so I

130
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,560
get 2x minus 6 is equal to 1.

131
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,570
Remember, I subtracted that
from both sides, so it

132
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,210
disappeared on the
right-hand side.

133
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,210
I could add 6 to both sides
of this equation.

134
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,350
I get 2x is equal to 1
plus 6, which is 7.

135
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,060
Divide both sides by 2, you get
x is equal to 7 over 2.

136
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,500
I went through this a
little bit faster.

137
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,920
But really, I just wanted to
show you that as long as do

138
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,650
legitimate operations, you're
going to get the same answer.

139
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,510
And you could check, verify
that this is indeed the

140
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,500
correct answer, if you like.

141
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,150
Now we have a word problem.

142
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,220
Let's see if we can
tackle this.

143
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,560
Lydia inherited a
sum of money.

144
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,460
She split it into
5 equal chunks.

145
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,850
So let me just say m is the
amount of money she has.

146
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,910
So she split into
5 equal chunks.

147
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:21,670
So let me say, Lydia's money
that she inherited.

148
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,790
   

149
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,910
She splits it into
5 equal chunks.

150
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,350
She invested 3 parts of the
money in a high interest bank.

151
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,490
So how much did she invest in
the high interest bank?

152
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:45,520
   

153
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,330
She divided it into 5 equal
chunks, and she invested 3 of

154
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,570
those chunks into a high
interest bank account.

155
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:59,400
So she took her money, divided
it into 5 chunks-- So this is

156
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,320
each of the 5 chunks.

157
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,770
Then she put 3 of those chunks,
or you could say she

158
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:11,450
took 3/5 of her money, and she
put it into the high interest

159
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,470
bank account, which adds
10% to the value.

160
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,630
So that's how much she
originally put into high

161
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,500
interest banking account.

162
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,830
She placed the rest of her
inheritance plus $500 in the

163
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,680
stock market.

164
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,930
So how much was that?

165
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,710
   

166
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,900
So she placed the rest
of her inheritance.

167
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,659
So she put 3/5 of it in the high
interest bank account.

168
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,140
What's left over?

169
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,260
What's going to be the 2/5?

170
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,280
2/5 of her money she is
going to invest in the

171
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,330
stock market, right?

172
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,540
You combine 3/5 plus 2/5,
you have all of the

173
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,070
money that she inherited.

174
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,720
But she didn't put
just the 2/5.

175
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,190
She put the rest of her
inheritance, which is the 2/5

176
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:57,890
m, plus $500, in the stock
market, but lost 20%.

177
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,620
So this is how much she put in,
and this is how much she

178
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,250
ends up with.

179
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:11,820
So put in is right there,
and then ends up with.

180
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:18,910
So on the checking accounts,
it added 10% of its value.

181
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:24,910
So she started with 3/5 of her
money, and it added another

182
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,180
10% of that.

183
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:32,690
So plus, let's say, 0.10
times the amount of

184
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,010
money she put in.

185
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,400
Times 3/5 of her money.

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,570
This is how much she
ends up with.

187
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,940
Her original amount that she put
into the account plus 10%

188
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,750
of the original amount.

189
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,740
It grew by 10%.

190
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,260
It added 10% of the value.

191
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:52,580
Now in the stock market, she
started with 2/5 m plus 500,

192
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,140
but she lost 20%
on that money.

193
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:07,760
So she loses 0.20 for 20%,
times 2/5 m plus 500.

194
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,630
That's how much she loses
on the market.

195
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,410
She loses 20% of this
amount of money.

196
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,060
Now at the end it says, if the
two accounts end up with the

197
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,160
exact same amount of
money in them, how

198
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,950
much did she inherit?

199
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,760
So this and this are going to
end up being equal, and we'll

200
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,130
have to solve for m.

201
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,100
So let's do that.

202
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,010
We get 3/5 m plus-- Well, let's
see, this is the same

203
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,840
thing as 1/10, right?

204
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,010
Let me write that way.

205
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,180
So 1/10 times 3/5 is 3/50.

206
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,890
Plus 3/50 m is equal to-- I just
multiplied the 1/10 times

207
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,880
3/5 --is equal to 2/5 m-- I
want to do it in that same

208
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:06,110
color, in the orange --is
equal to 2/5 m plus 500.

209
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,520
And then 0.2 is the same
thing as 1/5, right?

210
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,070
0.2-- let me write it over here
--is equal to 20/100,

211
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,630
which is equal to 1/5.

212
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,620
So we can rewrite this
right here as 1/5.

213
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:27,200
So 2/5 m plus 500 minus
1/5 times 2/5 plus

214
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,380
5 2/5 m plus 500.

215
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,220
So that's a hairy problem, but
well take it step by step and

216
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,850
see that it's not so bad.

217
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,600
So right here, let's add
3/5 of something

218
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,620
plus 3/50 of something.

219
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,290
Well, 3/5 is the same thing
as 30/50, right?

220
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,630
If I multiply the numerator
and the denominator by 10.

221
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,630
And now we can add this.

222
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:59,950
30/50 plus 3/50 is 33/50 m is
equal to-- and let's just

223
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,820
simplify this a little
bit --2/5 m plus 500.

224
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,360
Distribute the negative 1/5,
so you get negative 2/25 m,

225
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,630
and then negative 1/5 times
500 is minus 100.

226
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,040
Let's simplify this even more.

227
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:25,090
The left-hand side is still 33
over 50 m is equal to-- And

228
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,910
now we have we have these
coefficients on our m terms,

229
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,440
right here.

230
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,410
Those are our m terms.

231
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:38,220
So you could view it as
2/5 minus 2/25 m.

232
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,370
that takes care of that
term and that term.

233
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,190
I just factored the m out.

234
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,190
And then you have the
500 minus 100.

235
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,860
So that's plus 400.

236
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,140
Now, let's see.

237
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,140
2/5, if we multiplied the
numerator and denominator by

238
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,810
5, this becomes 10/25.

239
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,170
Right?

240
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:06,130
So our whole equation is now
33/50 m is equal to-- what is

241
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,350
10 minus 2?

242
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,560
So that's 8/25 m plus 400.

243
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,080
We're getting close!

244
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,770
We're getting close.

245
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,680
Now let's get both
m terms onto the

246
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,520
left-hand side of the equation.

247
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,680
So let's subtract 8/25
m from both sides.

248
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,600
   

249
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,110
Did that, so that the right-hand
side cancels outs.

250
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,710
So our right-hand side
is just equal to 400.

251
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:44,140
And then our left-hand side
is 33/50 minus 8 over 25.

252
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,810
So it's equal to 33 over
50 minus 8 over 25.

253
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,350
That's the same thing as minus
16 over 50, right?

254
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,190
I just multiply the numerator
and denominator by 2.

255
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,580
m is equal to 400.

256
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,535
We're almost there!

257
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:01,850
This is a nice, meaty problem.

258
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,440
Almost there.

259
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:11,290
And then 33 minus
16 is 17, right?

260
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:17,000
So we're left with 17/50
m is equal to 400.

261
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,450
And now we can multiply
both sides times

262
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,300
the inverse of 17/50.

263
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:28,220
So 50/17 times 50/17.

264
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,460
These cancel out, and you get
m is equal to-- and I'll get

265
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,310
the calculator out for this.

266
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:42,860
m is equal to 400 times
50 divided by

267
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:55,380
17 is equal to $1,176.47.

268
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,490
That's how much Lydia
started out with.

269
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,550
Hopefully you found that fun.

270
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,000
