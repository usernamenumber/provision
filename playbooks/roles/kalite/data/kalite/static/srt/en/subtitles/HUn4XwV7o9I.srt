1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,200
Is (3, -4) a solution to the equation 5x + 2y = 7?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,067
So they're saying,

3
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:12,957
"Does x equal 3, y equal negative 4 satisfy this equation, or this relationship right here?"

4
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:16,997
So one way to do it is to substitute x is equal to 3 and y is equal to negative 4 into this

5
00:00:16,997 --> 00:00:20,733
and see if 5 times x plus 2 times y does indeed equal 7

6
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:26,467
So we have 5 times 3 plus 2 times -4

7
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:34,267
This is equal to 15 plus -8, which does indeed equal 7.

8
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,533
So it does satisfy the equations.

9
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:39,400
So it is on the line; it is a solution.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,607
x = 3, y = -4 is a solution to this equation.

11
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:45,353
So we've essentially answered our question: It is.

12
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:47,333
Now another way to do it,

13
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,267
and I'm not gonna go into details here,

14
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:51,133
is you can actually graph the line.

15
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:53,034
So maybe the line might look something like this,

16
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:54,288
I'm not gonna do it in detail,

17
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,446
and you see, if you have a very good drawing of it,

18
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,533
you see whether the point lies on the line.

19
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:02,333
If the point, when you graph the point, does lie on the line,

20
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,533
it would be a solution.

21
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,000
If the point somehow ends up not being on the line,

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,733
then you'd know it isn't a solution.

23
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,733
But to do this, you would have to have a very good drawing,

24
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:12,400
so you could very precisely determine

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,467
whether it's on the line.

26
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,067
If you do the substitution method,

27
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:17,369
if you just substitute the values into the equation

28
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,667
to see if it comes out mathematically,

29
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,620
this will always be exact.

30
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,267
So this is all we really had to do,

31
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:24,867
all we really have to do in this example.

32
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:28,867
So it definitely is a solution to the equation
