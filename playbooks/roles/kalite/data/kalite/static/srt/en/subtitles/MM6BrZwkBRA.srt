1
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,620
Informally, we can think of information as some message –

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,590
stored or transmitted – using some medium.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,865
When you paint, you are representing your message

4
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:14,636
using a continuous pattern,

5
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:18,563
with seemingly endless numbers of possible forms.

6
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:22,326
You are free to express yourself.

7
00:00:22,326 --> 00:00:24,639
When humans began developing writing systems,

8
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:28,472
we naturally had to divide our world into a finite

9
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:32,960
number of atomic units – which we express using 'symbols.'

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,517
Now any written language can be thought of in this way.

11
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:39,048
Messages are formed by arranging

12
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:42,052
symbols in specific patterns.

13
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:44,671
Let's return to 3,000 BC,

14
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:47,752
and explore two ancient writing systems.

15
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:51,927
First, in ancient Egypt we had 'hieroglyphics' –

16
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,840
a priestly form of communication, reserved for

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,011
governmental, fiscal, magical and religious purposes.

18
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:03,106
It was practiced by a select few writers, known as 'scribes.'

19
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:05,540
And writing was generally unintelligible

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,234
to the common people.

21
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:12,381
The symbols, themselves, broadly fall into two categories:

22
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,651
'word signs' – which are symbols that represent

23
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:17,592
a single meaningful concept –

24
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:20,518
back – apple

25
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:21,906
– and 'sound signs.'

26
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:24,156
These symbols represent chunks of sound.

27
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:27,466
[PEOPLE PRONOUNCING SINGLE-SYLLABLE SOUNDS]

28
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,397
Now the total number of different symbols

29
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:33,989
in common use was over 1,500.

30
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:36,627
And if you divide all of these symbols

31
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:39,318
into word signs versus sound signs,

32
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:43,119
we find a much smaller portion of sound signs.

33
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,194
There were around 140 sound signs –

34
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:52,059
– and of these, only 33 represented distinct consonants –

35
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:56,012
a tiny fraction of all of the symbols in use.

36
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:58,097
At the time, the medium used

37
00:01:58,097 --> 00:02:01,139
to store the symbols was primarily rock.

38
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:04,231
And this was ideal for durable inscriptions

39
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:07,513
allowing messages to travel into the future.

40
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:09,675
Mobility was not a main concern

41
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:12,702
when communicating messages in this way.

42
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:14,291
However, a new physical medium

43
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,364
for storing symbols was emerging at the time.

44
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:20,657
Along the Nile, silt deposits, left from flooding,

45
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,954
made the surrounding land extremely fertile.

46
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:28,261
And one of the many crops they grew was 'papyrus.'

47
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,066
It could be sliced into strips,

48
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,181
and these strips were then soaked –

49
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:38,641
and [woven] together, and finally, pressed –

50
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:42,252
allowing the natural sugars to act as glue.

51
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:47,660
After several days, it dried and formed

52
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,291
an almost weightless tablet.

53
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:55,651
This medium was ideal for sending messages

54
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:58,580
across greater spaces – [compared to inscriptions on] more

55
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,875
durable [surfaces] – focused on time.

56
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,895
Now this shift towards cheap,

57
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:06,562
portable mediums for storing symbols

58
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,600
coincided with the spread of writing

59
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,901
into the hands of more people, for new purposes.

60
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,776
Gradually, as people began to write more on papyrus,

61
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:19,511
the symbols evolved to suit more rapid writing.

62
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:23,544
This led to a cursive script known as 'hieratic.'

63
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:25,155
For example, here is the world's

64
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:28,410
oldest surviving surgical document.

65
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,534
It's written in hieratic script, dated to around 1,600 BC.

66
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:35,957
Now these symbols were based on hieroglyphics,

67
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:38,959
however, the pictures were simplified to match

68
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,987
the swiftness of writing – an ancient shorthand.

69
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:45,840
Also, the number of common symbols

70
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,266
in use began to shrink – down to around 700.

71
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,763
By escaping from the heavy medium of stone,

72
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:54,561
thought gained lightness.

73
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,780
A marked increase in writing by hand

74
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,913
was accompanied by the secularization

75
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:01,320
of writing, thought, and activity.

76
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,894
This led to a new writing system called 'demotic' –

77
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:09,439
around 650 BC – which was devised specifically

78
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,835
to facilitate the ease of rapid writing.

79
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,264
For example, this text is known as a marriage contract,

80
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:20,116
and is one of the earliest known examples of demotic script.

81
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:21,939
It's interesting to notice that there was

82
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:24,357
a dramatic reduction, again, in the total number

83
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:26,677
of symbols with this new system –

84
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:29,760
roughly 10% of the total number

85
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,884
of symbols used before.

86
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:33,555
This was due to a shift towards

87
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:36,847
the use of 'phonetic' symbols – or sound signs –

88
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:39,809
[PEOPLE PRONOUNCING SOUND SIGNS]

89
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:43,137
– over word symbols – or meaning signs.

90
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,846
And the new simplicity meant that

91
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:48,799
children could be taught to write at a young age.

92
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:52,416
We see this same pattern in other cultures.

93
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:56,174
Let's return back to 3,000 BC and visit Mesopotamia

94
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:58,421
where 'cuneiform' was the writing system –

95
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:01,118
originally used for fiscal purposes,

96
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:02,777
as it was a powerful method

97
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:05,585
of tracking debt and surplus commodities –

98
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,517
before the invention of coins.

99
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,419
For example, here is a document recording

100
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:13,142
someone's stock of animal hides.

101
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:15,676
And this type of writing evolved to suit other needs.

102
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:17,803
For example, this tablet contains a recipe

103
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:20,179
for bread and beer.

104
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:20,976
And here's another tablet

105
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:23,382
which contains a legal document.

106
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:25,320
Now originally, the writing system

107
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,978
was used by the Sumerians –

108
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:30,651
and there were over 2,000 different symbols in use –

109
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,779
which could also be divided into

110
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:35,550
word signs and sound signs.

111
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,162
Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian

112
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:40,152
as the spoken language.

113
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:45,469
And here is the earliest known dictionary – from 2,300 BC.

114
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:49,740
It contains word lists in Sumerian and Akkadian.

115
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,740
And this was discovered in modern Syria.

116
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,865
When it was adapted by the Akkadians,

117
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:56,511
and fitted to their language,

118
00:05:56,511 --> 00:06:00,053
they reduced the number of symbols to around 600.

119
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:01,116
And they did this again

120
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:04,346
by moving towards sound signs.

121
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:07,484
Again, we see both hieroglyphics and cuneiform

122
00:06:07,484 --> 00:06:10,180
using several hundred sound symbols

123
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,766
in their more evolved forms.

124
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:16,449
And as writing systems escaped their formal usage,

125
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,463
and spread to more and more people,

126
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,965
the soil was ripe for the invention of

127
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:24,700
a brand new writing system for the people.

128
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,704
One of the great discoveries in the history of writing,

129
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:30,617
is dated to around 1,700 BC.

130
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:34,508
The Sinai Inscriptions were found in the Sinai Peninsula –

131
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:36,873
and they were about 20 feet apart.

132
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:40,154
This was important, because each picture

133
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:42,376
denotes a consonant sound –

134
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:46,026
and no word signs are used.

135
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:47,576
When sounded out correctly,

136
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:51,811
the letters would produce words in ancient Semitic.

137
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,532
Although not fully deciphered, this message appears

138
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:58,443
to be of the form 'name, rank, and prayer.'

139
00:06:58,443 --> 00:07:01,815
The two words deciphered are 'chief' and 'god.'

140
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:05,738
This innocent example was part of a writing revolution –

141
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:09,414
creating meaning by merging sound signs only.

142
00:07:09,414 --> 00:07:14,844
[GIRL PRONOUNCING ONE- 
AND TWO-SYLLABLE WORDS]

143
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:19,591
By 1,000 BC, we arrive at the Phoenician alphabet,

144
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:21,552
which emerges along the Mediterranean,

145
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:22,911
used by the Phoenicians,

146
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:26,112
who are a maritime trading culture.

147
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,256
The Phoenician writing system was based on

148
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:32,652
the principle that one sign represents one consonant.

149
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,465
And it was used to write a northern Semitic language

150
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:39,013
containing only 22 symbols total.

151
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:41,122
The symbols chosen to represent these sounds

152
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:43,928
were often borrowed from hieroglyphic pictures –

153
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:48,371
so that the letter's name began with the letter's sound.

154
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:51,750
For example, 'mem' – which stood for 'water' –

155
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,245
became what we know of as the letter 'M.'

156
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:57,531
'Alph' which stood for ox,

157
00:07:57,531 --> 00:08:00,109
became what we know of as the letter 'A.'

158
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:02,412
But the secret power of this alphabet –

159
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:04,177
unknown to its inventors –

160
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:07,070
was that it did not need Semitic speech

Europe, India, and southeast Asia –

166
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,636
carrying literacy around the globe.

167
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:27,221
This was the source of the Greek – and later Roman –

168
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:30,771
alphabet forms we know today.

169
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:33,846
The idea of an alphabet is a powerful method

170
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,647
for transmitting and storing information.

171
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,352
Realize, it doesn't really matter

172
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,746
what the symbols are, or how you choose them –

173
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:43,884
or even what language [they're] in.

174
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:46,424
Information is just a selection

175
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:51,161
from a collection of possible symbols.

176
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:54,153
And over time, we have always looked for

177
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:56,612
faster, more efficient ways of transporting

178
00:08:56,612 --> 00:09:00,177
information across greater and greater spaces.

179
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:02,725
And when we tred doing this using new mediums

180
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:06,102
which travel faster than any human or animal,

181
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:10,084
an engineering problem presents itself.

182
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:14,817
