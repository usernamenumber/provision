1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,820
You sample 36 apples from
your farm's harvest of

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,070
over 200,000 apples.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:12,330
The mean weight of the sample
is 112 grams with a 40 gram

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,070
sample standard deviation.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,720
What is the probability that the
mean weight of all 200,000

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,760
apples is within 100
and 124 grams?

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,810
Let's think about what
they're asking.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,120
So there's some distribution of
all of the weights of all

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,990
200,000 apples or there's
more than 200,000.

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,800
We don't even know how many
apples, just a huge number.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,390
So there's some population
distribution of weights.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,430
Maybe it looks something
like that.

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,840
It will have a mean weight.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,350
It has a mean weight.

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,170
We don't know what that mean
weight is, and it also has a

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,350
population standard deviation.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,240
So this might be one standard
deviation above the population

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,630
mean, that would be one standard
deviation below.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,280
And we'll say this distance
right here is the population

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,840
standard deviation.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,280
Both of these are parameters
that we do not know of the

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,720
entire population.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,210
This is the population
distribution right over there.

25
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,800
Now, we know from our experience
with the last few

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,620
videos that you can repeatedly
take samples, or if you kind

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,570
of visualize, repeatingly take
samples of a certain size-- in

28
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,750
this video we're going to focus
on sample sizes of 36.

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,270
And you keep taking the means of
those sample size, and you

30
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,130
plot the frequency with which
you get those means, you would

31
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,020
eventually get something
called the sampling

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,790
distribution of the
sample mean.

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,280
Let me write this down.

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:44,200
The sampling distribution
of the sample mean.

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,070
So that might look something
like this.

36
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,690
I'll try to draw it a little
bit bigger since we're

37
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,830
probably going to use this
one a little bit more.

38
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,690
It is going to be pretty close
to a normal distribution.

39
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,550
   

40
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,850
It's going to have some mean,
and we specify that-- let me

41
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,270
draw it down here.

42
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,250
It has mean when we show that
this is the mean of the

43
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,680
sampling distribution.

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,090
And we know that the mean of
the sampling distribution,

45
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,130
that the means of all of your
means, or of the actual

46
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,010
distribution of means, is
actually going to be your

47
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,480
original population mean.

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,760
So this is going to be your
population mean over here.

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,360
And it also has some
standard deviation.

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,860
So maybe this is a standard
deviation above the mean, this

51
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,240
is a standard deviation below
the mean, right over there.

52
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,270
And we can specify that by the
standard deviation of the

53
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,590
sampling distribution
of the means.

54
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,780
And we know that this can
be a given, or I guess

55
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,120
approximated, because for fairly
large samples this

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,230
gives a pretty good indicator.

57
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,720
There's a couple of correction
factors if you

58
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,540
get to smaller samples.

59
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:02,430
But this is going to be our
population standard deviation

60
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,600
divided by the square root--
and we saw this in the last

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,990
two videos-- divided by the
square root of the number of

62
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,590
samples we have when we
calculate each of those means.

63
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,500
And we know in this example that
we are taking 36 samples.

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,030
So this is the square
root of 36.

65
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,880
This is a sampling distribution
of the sample

66
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,990
mean-- let me write it over
here-- 4n equals 36.

67
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,410
For each of our sample buckets
or baskets to have 36 items

68
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,720
and then we take their mean.

69
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,210
And then that is essentially
each of those means is a

70
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,820
sample from this distribution
right over here.

71
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,100
The means are the sample from
this-- the things that we're

72
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,570
using to calculate the samples
are samples, or the things

73
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,720
that were used to calculating
the means are

74
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,670
samples from that.

75
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,840
Hopefully that isn't
too confusing.

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,490
But this isn't the first
time we've seen it.

77
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,890
Anyway, this distribution's
standard deviation is going to

78
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,650
be the standard deviation of
this population standard

79
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,670
deviation divided by 6.

80
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,710
But we still don't know this.

81
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,650
We still don't know this
parameter up here.

82
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,600
Now with that said let's
refocus on what they're

83
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,390
actually asking us.

84
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,270
They want to know the
probability that the mean

85
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,460
weight of all 200,000 apples.

86
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,370
Well the mean weight of all
200,000 apples is that

87
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,920
parameter right over there.

88
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,870
And they want to know what is a
probably that it is between

89
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:27,020
100 and 124 grams. So they're
actually asking us if

90
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,630
something is between 100 and 124
grams it is within 12 of

91
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,070
our sample mean.

92
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,510
Right?

93
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,430
That's all they're saying.

94
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,100
What is a probability that this
thing is within 12 of our

95
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,950
sample mean?

96
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,770
Because if you're less than 12
or if you're 12 less you're

97
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,410
going to get to 100.

98
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,400
If you're 12 more you're
going to get to 124.

99
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,450
So what they're asking us is
what is the probability that

100
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,640
our population mean, this
parameter, this unknown

101
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:04,440
parameter, is within 12 of the
mean of our one sample.

102
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,350
   

103
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,850
Now if I told you that I'm
within 5 feet of you, then

104
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,270
that also means that you're
within 5 feet of me.

105
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,280
So this is the exact same thing
as the probability that

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:27,620
the sample mean is within
12 of the actual mean.

107
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,440
I really you to-- this
should make sense.

108
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,700
If I said what's the probability
that I'm either 5

109
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,680
behind you or 5 ahead of you,
that's the same thing as a

110
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,880
probability that you're either
5 behind me or 5 behind you.

111
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,760
This is asking what's the
probability that we're 12

112
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,730
apart, or what's the probability
that I am within

113
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,120
12 feet of you.

114
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,280
And this is the probability
that you're

115
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,070
within 12 feet of me.

116
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,970
They're asking the
exact same thing.

117
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,960
But when you phrase it this way
it might dawn on you that

118
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,910
you might be able to use the
sampling distribution of the

119
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,980
sampling mean.

120
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,220
There's some unknown mean here,
which is the same thing

121
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,390
as this value right here.

122
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,620
So this thing-- let me make it
very clear-- this is also the

123
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,750
same thing because this
value and this value

124
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,910
are the same thing.

125
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,090
This is exactly the same thing
as asking what is the

126
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:21,430
probability that our one sample
mean is within 12 of

127
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,710
the actual mean of the sampling
distribution.

128
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,080
So we're just saying what's the
probability that that one

129
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,530
sample mean we have is
within 12 of this

130
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,710
actual sampling mean.

131
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,240
At this point your brain should
be reading that gee, if

132
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,340
I could figure out how many
standard deviations that is,

133
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,390
how many standard deviations
away that is on this

134
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,200
distribution, I can then use a
Z-table to actually figure out

135
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,890
the probability.

136
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,610
And that's exactly what
we're going to do.

137
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,800
But there's one slight
complication here.

138
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,670
We don't know the actual
standard deviation of the

139
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,030
sampling distribution.

140
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,030
We just know that it's
this thing right over

141
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,800
here divided by 6.

142
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,270
But we don't know this thing.

143
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,980
So what we're going to
do is get our best

144
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,210
estimate of this thing.

145
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,880
So we need a good estimator
for the actual population

146
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,150
standard deviation.

147
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,730
What's our best estimate
of that?

148
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,400
What's going to be our sample
standard deviation?

149
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,360
We sampled 36 things,
and we had a sample

150
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,670
distribution of 40.

151
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:23,450
So we have a sample distribution
of-- let

152
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,610
me write this way.

153
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,400
This is going to be
approximately equal to our

154
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,040
sample distribution or sample
standard deviation, which we

155
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,020
got to be 40.

156
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,620
So we literally just took-- we
found the mean of our 36

157
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,810
apples, mean weight was 112
grams. Then we found the

158
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,000
square distance from each of the
apples' weights to this.

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,330
Took the average of those.

160
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,880
Well we didn't take the straight
up average, we

161
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,060
divided by n minus 1.

162
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,040
We learned all of this many,
many videos ago.

163
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,480
And then we took the square
root of that.

164
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,080
This gave us the sample standard
deviation, it is our

165
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,980
best estimator for this.

166
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,850
So if this is our best estimator
for that, our best

167
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,610
estimator for this thing right
here is going to be equal to

168
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,890
our sample standard deviation
divided by 6, which is equal

169
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,720
to 40 over 6, which is
equal to-- let's get

170
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,390
our calculator out.

171
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:22,570
So if we have 40 divided by
6, we have 6.6-- I'll

172
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,940
just write down 6.67.

173
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,470
So this thing right
here is 6.67.

174
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,890
So our best estimate of the
standard deviation of the

175
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,159
sample distribution of the
sample mean is 6.67.

176
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,950
So this distance right
here is 6.67.

177
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,500
So how many standard deviations
is 12 if you look

178
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,450
at this distribution
right over here?

179
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,640
Well we just divide
12 by 6.67.

180
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,070
So let me get the calculator
back up.

181
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,890
So if we have 12-- I'll just
divide it by that 6.--

182
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,650
actually this exact number--
12 divided by-- answer just

183
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,490
means the last answer we got--
that gives us 1.8 exactly.

184
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,000
The numbers just happened
to work out well.

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,580
So this is completely analogous
to saying what is

186
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:18,440
the probability that our one
sample mean is within 1.8

187
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,870
standard deviations.

188
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,640
Let me write it this way.

189
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,410
It was in 1.8 standard
deviations of the sample

190
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:31,570
mean-- within 1.8 of these--
of our actual mean of our

191
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,370
sampling distribution.

192
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,030
So we're literally
just asking that.

193
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,500
So if you look at this
distribution up here, within

194
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,270
1.8 standard deviations, this
is one standard deviation,

195
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,000
another 0.8 would maybe get
us right about there.

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,280
And we're within 1.8 above and
1.8 below, so this is 1.8

197
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,580
standard deviations above the
mean, this is 1.8 standard

198
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,110
deviations below the mean.

199
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,780
So we're just going to say
what's the probability when we

200
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,930
just took this one sample of 36
apples that we lie in this

201
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,180
space over here?

202
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,860
   

203
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,600
And to figure this out what I'm
going to do is I'm going

204
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,980
to use our Z-table to figure
out essentially

205
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,030
this space over here.

206
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,600
Just what's the probability
of being 12 above it.

207
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,180
And then we can just double it
because a normal distribution

208
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,410
is symmetric.

209
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,720
So let's go to our Z-table.

210
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,640
So what's the probability of
being between the mean and 1.8

211
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,370
standard deviations
above the mean?

212
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,700
So if you just go straight to
your Z-table, 1.80 is this

213
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,580
right over here.

214
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,030
Now you get this
0.9641 number.

215
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,410
But be very careful.

216
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,710
This 0.9641 number that gives
you-- so if I draw a normal

217
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,910
distribution-- let me draw a
better normal distribution.

218
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,760
If I draw a normal distribution
like that, and

219
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,450
this is our mean, this 0.9641
number tells us the

220
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,130
probability that we are less
than 1.8 standard deviations

221
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:54,770
above the mean.

222
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:59,800
So this is 1.8 standard
deviations up here, then this

223
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,360
is our mean right over here.

224
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:09,980
This is giving us this entire
area right over there.

225
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,770
So if I want just this area
right here, what I need to do

226
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:23,410
is from this value, from this
0.9641, I need to subtract

227
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,680
this, the probability that
you're essentially directly

228
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,860
less than the mean.

229
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,720
And that is this.

230
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,930
This is the probability that
you're less than the mean, or

231
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,230
you're less than the mean plus
0 standard deviations.

232
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,880
So this value right
here is 0.50.

233
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,720
This whole area that I
just showed you right

234
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,460
over there is 0.9641.

235
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:57,150
So this area right over here
is going to be 0.9641 minus

236
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:04,040
0.5, which is going to
be equal to 0.4641.

237
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,770
So this area right here, just
what's in the magenta.

238
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:15,670
Just between there and
there is 0.4641.

239
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,940
Let me make sure I
got that right.

240
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,730
0.4641.

241
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,915
And if I want this entire
area I just double it.

242
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:23,230
If I want to include this
as well, I just

243
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,240
have to double that.

244
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,490
So let me get my calculator
out, let me get the trusty

245
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,110
calculator.

246
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:41,110
So we're going to have 0.4641
times 2 is equal to 0.9282.

247
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:49,530
So this whole area right over
here is equal to 0.9282.

248
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,870
So we did something neat.

249
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,880
The probability that the--
remember that well, we're

250
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,570
answering right here.

251
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,470
The probably that our sample
mean just happens to be within

252
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,620
1.8 standard deviations--
remember, that was 1.8

253
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,500
standard deviations of the
sample means from the actual

254
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,920
mean is 0.9282, or there's
a 92.82% chance.

255
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,860
But that's also saying that
there's a 92.82% chance that

256
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,230
the actual mean is within 12 of
our measured sample mean.

257
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,900
And that is neat.

258
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,180
Because for the first time
ever-- we started with very

259
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,020
little information.

260
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,700
We just started with a little
sample over here.

261
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,800
And we were able to get as much
information about that

262
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,930
sample as possible.

263
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:40,850
But we can now say that there's
a 92.82% chance that

264
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,280
the actual mean is within 12
of the mean we measured.

265
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:52,720
That the actual mean is between
100 and 124, or that

266
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,260
we're 92.82% confident that
the actual mean is in the

267
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,670
range between 100 and
124 grams. I think

268
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,660
that's pretty neat.

269
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:02,667
