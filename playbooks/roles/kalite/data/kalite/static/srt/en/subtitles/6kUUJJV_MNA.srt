00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:06,173
[music playing]

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,922
We're in the Bargello in Florence
in an enormous, vaulted room.

3
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:12,691
This is a building that was used for judicial purposes.

4
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:14,041
Now it's a museum.

5
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:18,825
And it holds Donatello's "David", one of the most important sculptures of the early Renaissance.

6
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:26,924
Important because it was the first freestanding nude sculpture since classical antiquity, quite an achievement.

7
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:32,418
So for a thousand years the Christian West had looked to the soul as the place to focus.

8
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:35,251
The body was seen as a path to corruption.

9
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,951
And so it was not to be celebrated.

10
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:41,918
So what we're seeing here is a return to ancient Greece and Rome's love of the body,

11
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:43,237
its respect for the body,
which is so evident.

12
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:49,326
It really is. Donatello has looked back
at ancient Greek and Roman sculpture

13
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:54,592
also for the position that David is standing in, the position of contraposto, which is a very relaxed pose

14
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:58,332
where the weight is placed on one leg.
The other leg is bent.

15
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:03,204
And the figure has because of contraposto 
a sense of movement.

16
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:09,704
In the Renaissance this figure looked remarkably alive given the way medieval sculpture had looked for so long.

17
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:12,853
It's detached from any kind of figural group
or any kind of architecture.

18
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:17,887
And so there really is a sense of autonomy
as if this figure could move forward of its own accord.

19
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:21,720
The figure is referencing the classical in another way 
as well in its very material nature.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,787
This is bronze, largely copper, with a little bit of tin 
added to it to give it strength, and it's actually hollow.

21
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:32,237
It is created through a technique 
which is known as lost wax casting,

22
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:35,788
which the ancient Romans and the ancient Greeks 
before them had employed,

23
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:39,421
and which had been used throughout
the medieval period, but not at this scale.

24
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:43,253
And it was just in the early Renaissance 
that artists are beginning to re-explore

25
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:47,038
how to create bronze sculptures that are this large.

26
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:55,495
David is very young, and it's hard not to see a kind of sensuality in the way that David puts his hand on his hip

27
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,412
and looks down.

28
00:01:57,412 --> 00:02:02,729
And the fact that he's wearing boots 
and a hat and is otherwise nude,

29
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,445
there is a kind of eroticism here.

30
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:12,378
And that's especially evident if you look at the fact
that David is standing on the now severed head of Goliath.

31
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:17,329
In fact, in his right hand he's holding 
Goliath's own sword which David has used,

32
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:21,290
but because he's standing on that head,
that pushes his leg up.

33
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,623
One of the wings of the helmet is just riding
up the inner thigh, perhaps a little too high, in fact.

34
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:30,440
And so there really is a kind of overt sexuality here.

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,590
And it's so interesting, because it's at odds 
with the civic symbolism of this sculpture.

36
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,906
This was a sculpture that was really important to the city of Florence, and yet it has this very intimate quality to it.

37
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:46,939
It was seen in the 1460s in the Medici garden.

38
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,256
Although we're not exactly sure who commissioned it,
it's likely that it was a Medici.

39
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:55,423
So the Medici palace had a large entranceway,
and there was a kind of axes

40
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:59,423
that allowed you to see directly into the garden
and this would have been visible in the center of it.

41
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:00,206
That's right.

42
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:03,623
It's really important for us to remember 
that to the Florentine people

43
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:06,106
this wasn't just King David from the Bible.

44
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:08,506
There were all sorts of associations.

45
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:13,924
First of all, David in the Biblical story defeats his enemy, 
even though he's the underdog.

46
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:16,323
He defeats his enemy with God's help.

47
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:20,974
The Florentine people felt, very much identified 
with David because like David,

48
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:23,523
they had defeated their enemy.

49
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:29,891
Or this is how they saw it, they had defeated their enemy, 
the Duke of Milan, in the early 15th century,

50
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:31,256
with the help of God.

51
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:36,553
In fact they felt blessed and chosen by God 
and the heirs of the ancient Roman republic,

52
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:42,386
and so the subject of David represented Florence, 
the Florentine republic.

53
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:45,453
So Goliath in a sense takes on the role of the Duke of Milan.

54
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:52,070
Milan was significantly stronger than Florence, which was a mercantile culture, as opposed to a military power.

55
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,874
And Florence was of course was a republic 
whereas Milan was an autocracy.

56
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:58,574
That is, it had a single ruler.

57
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:02,158
Well, and so David became a symbol
of the Florentine republic.

58
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,891
Anyone looking at this sculpture
in the Medici garden in the 15th century

59
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:13,073
would have understood David as a reference
to the liberties and freedoms that were so cherished

60
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:17,540
by the Florentine people and had been threatened
by the Duke of Milan.

61
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,650
On the other hand you could say that the Medici were usurping the civic symbolism for themselves in some ways.

62
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,701
And in fact, when the Medici were run out of town, 
this sculpture was actually taken to the Signoria,

63
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:31,018
that is, to the town hall, and made a public sculpture.

64
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:36,061
And so there is really the sense of the investment 
of this culture in this story.

65
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:42,978
Right, and by so having it in the Medici garden
appropriating this symbol of the city,

66
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:47,704
and all that was great about the city,
Medici were appropriating that for themselves.

67
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:52,444
So here in this sculpture is this embodiment
of the promise of a long rule.

68
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:58,812
David will grow up to be king, to have been enormously wise and in a sense it was a perfect kind of story

69
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:05,146
for the Medici to put forward as a representation not only of the city but specifically of their own rule within the city.

70
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:10,913
Right. So they are sort of identifying themselves as the city of Florence, identifying themselves with youthfulness,

71
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:15,130
with King David, and with all that's great
about the Florentine republic.

72
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,012
And although this is a sculpture 
that is about war, the symbols

73
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:22,080
are clearly about David and peace 
and the Medici and peace.

74
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,046
David wears a soft hat 
as opposed to the helmet of war

75
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:26,980
that Goliath wears.

76
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,596
David has severed Goliath's head
with Goliath's own battle-hardened sword.

77
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:35,747
If you look at that sword closely,
you can see that there are notches out of it.

78
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:37,746
It's been in many, many battles.

79
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:41,129
David needs to borrow it
in order to sever that head.

80
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:43,613
But in David's other hand,
in his left hand,

81
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:47,689
he holds a rock, presumably the rock 
that he used in the slingshot

82
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,472
to actually fell the giant in the first place.

83
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:54,405
But I think it's interesting,
that Donatello, here, a sculptor,

84
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:59,838
is actually portraying that rock as in a sense
the opposing weapon to the sword.

85
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:03,364
That is, a material that Donatello
as a sculptor often carves.

86
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,948
He works in marble as often
as he does in bronze, perhaps more often.

87
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:10,980
And so are these in a sense the
two weapons of the two cities?

88
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,897
In other words, the violence of Milan
versus the culture of Florence.

89
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:20,130
The iconography, all of the meanings,
David and what that meant to the city of Florence,

90
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,198
the eroticism, or even the
homoeroticism,

91
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:28,330
art historians are not really sure
about all of those meanings.

92
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,830
for the 15th century Florentine people.

93
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,463
And some art historians have even suggested
that the identification of this figure as David

94
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,429
is not even completely secure,

95
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,677
that it could also have been
read as Mercury.

96
00:06:40,677 --> 00:06:44,878
And so we see it in a complicated way,
and it's quite likely that the people of Florence

97
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:48,543
in the 15th century saw it
in a complicated way

98
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:51,043
and had multiple readings of it.

99
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,244
It's an important reminder that
art history itself is a process

100
00:06:54,244 --> 00:07:00,229
of trying to restore meaning and
understand meaning through the lens of time.

101
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:01,793
And is, after all, 
600 years old.

102
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:02,660
That's right.

103
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,028
But nevertheless, it is one of
the great sculptures

104
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:10,028
that really embodies so many of the ideals
and so many of the concerns of the 15th century.
