1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,897
Let's start again with a point let's call that

2
00:00:02,897 --> 00:00:05,612
point, "Point A." And what I'm curious about

3
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:09,566
is all of the points on my screen that are exactly

4
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:14,202
2cm away from "Point A." So 2cm on my screen

5
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:18,648
is about that far. So clearly if I start at "A" and I go 2cm

6
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:22,756
in that direction, this point is 2cm from "A." If I call that

7
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:27,800
"Point B" then I could say line segment AB is 2cm

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,800
the length is 2cm. Remember, this would refer to

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,800
the actual line segment. I could say this looks nice but if

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,667
I talk about it's length, I would get rid of that

11
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,133
line on top, and I would just say, "'AB' is equal to

12
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,913
2. If I wanted to put units, I would say 2cm.

13
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:44,933
But I'm not curious just about B, I want to think

14
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:48,159
about ALL the points. The set of ALL of the points

15
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,998
that are exactly 2cm away from "A." So I could go

16
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:55,098
2cm in the other direction, maybe get to point

17
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:59,913
"C" right over here. So "AC" is also going to be equal

18
00:00:59,913 --> 00:01:03,267
to 2cm. But I could go 2cm in any direction. And so

19
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:06,471
if I find that of all of the points that are exactly 2cm

20
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:11,195
away from "A," I will get a very familiar looking

21
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:14,564
shape, like this: (I'm drawing this free-hand,) so I would

22
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,533
get a shape that looks like this. Actually, let me draw

23
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,410
it in I don't want to make you think that it's only the

24
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,533
points where there's white, it's ALL of these points

25
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:29,267
right over here. Let me clear out all of these and I will

26
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:35,067
just draw a solid line. It could look something like

27
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:40,733
that (my best attempt.) And this set of all the points

28
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:46,267
that are exactly 2cm away from "A," is a circle, which

29
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:48,267
I'm sure you are already familiar with. But that is

30
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:50,867
the formal definition, the set of all points that are

31
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:57,067
a fixed distance from "A." If I said, "The set of all points

32
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:00,267
that are 3cm from "A," it might look something like this:"

33
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:06,933
That would give us another circle. (I think you get the

34
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:10,733
general idea.) Now, what I want to introduce to you

35
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:13,200
in this video is ourselves to some of the concepts

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,133
and words that we use when dealing with circles.

37
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:20,267
So let me get rid of 3cm circle. So first of all, let's

38
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:26,600
think about this distance, or one of these line segments

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,667
that join "A" which we would call the center of the

40
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:32,867
circle. So we will call "A" the center of the circle,

41
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,933
which makes sense just from the way we use the word

42
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:37,400
'center' in everyday life, what I want to do is think

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,400
about what line segment "AB" is. "AB" connects the

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,600
center and it connects a point on the circle itself.

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,533
Remember, the circle itself is all the points that

46
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,400
are equal distance from the center. So "AB," any point,

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,333
line segment, I should say, that connects the center to

48
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,667
a point on the circle we would call a radius. And so

49
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:06,333
the length of the radius is 2cm. And you're probably

50
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,267
already familiar with the word 'radius,' but I'm just

51
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:10,733
being a little bit more formal. And what's interesting

52
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,400
about geometry, at least when you start learning at the

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
high-school level is that it's probably the first

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,667
class where you're introduced to a slightly more formal

55
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,200
mathematics where we're a little more careful about

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,333
giving our definitions and then building on those

57
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,533
definitions to come up with interesting results and

58
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:28,533
proving to ourselves that we definitely know what we

59
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:30,533
think we know. And so that's why we're being a little

60
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:33,867
more careful with our language over here. So "AB" is

61
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:37,800
a radius, line segment "AB," and so is line segment,

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,867
(let me put another point on here) let's say this is

63
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:46,267
"X" so line segment "AX" is also a radius. Now you

64
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:56,400
can also have other forms of lines and line segments

65
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,467
that interact in interesting ways with the circle.

66
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:03,600
So you could have a line that just intersects that

67
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,400
circle exactly one point. So let's call that point

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
right over there and let's call that "D." And let's say

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,800
you have a line and the only point on the circle that

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,600
the only point in the set of all the points that are

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,933
equal distance from "A," the only point on that

72
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:23,000
circle that is also on that line is point "D." And we

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,533
could call that line, "line L." So sometimes you will

74
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,867
see lines specified by some of the points on them.

75
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,600
So for example, if I have another point right over here

76
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,133
called "E," we could call this line, "line DE," or we

77
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:40,267
could just put a little script letter here with an "L" and

78
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:43,467
say this "line L." But this line that only has one point

79
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:47,400
in common with our circle, we call this 'a tangent line.'

80
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,867
So "Line L" is tangent. Tangent to the circle. So let me

81
00:04:54,867 --> 00:05:13,267
write it this way, "'line L' is tangent to the circle

82
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:15,867
centered at "A"" So this tells us that this is the circle

83
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,600
we're talking about, because who knows? maybe we had

84
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
another circle over here that is centered at "M."

85
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,333
So we have to specify. It's not tangent to that one,

86
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,467
it's tangent to this one. So this circle with a dot in

87
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,867
the middle tells we're talking about circle, and this

88
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,600
is a circle centered at point "A." I want to be very

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,733
clear. Point "A" is not on the circle, point "A" is

90
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,200
the center of the circle. The points on the circle are

91
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,267
the points equal distant from point "A." Now, "L" is

92
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:44,267
tangent because it only intersects the circle in one

93
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:49,800
point. You could just as easily imagine a line that

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,333
intersects the circle at two points. So we could call,

95
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,667
maybe this is "F" and this is "G." You could call that

96
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:00,133
line "FG." And the line that intersects at two points

97
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:13,533
we call this a secant of circle "A." It is a secant line

98
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,667
to this circle right here. Because it intersects it

99
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,333
in two points. Now, if "FG" was just a segment, if it

100
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,333
didn't keep on going forever like lines do, if we only

101
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:32,933
spoke about this line segment, between "FG," and not

102
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,933
thinking about going on forever, then all the sudden,

103
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:38,200
we have a line segment, which we would specify there,

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,600
and we would call this a chord of the circle. A chord of

105
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:50,267
"circle "A." It starts on a point of the circle, a point

106
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:53,667
that is, in this case, 2cm away and then it finishes

107
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:57,133
at a point on the circle. So it connects two points on

108
00:06:57,133 --> 00:07:00,733
the circle. Now, you can have cords like this, and you

109
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:03,933
can also have a chord, as you can imagine, a chord that

110
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:07,400
actually goes through the center of the circle. So let's

111
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,333
call this, "point 'H.'" And you have a straight line connecting

112
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,667
"F" to "H" through "A." (That's about as straight as I could

113
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:21,267
draw it.) So if you have a chord like that, that contains

114
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:25,667
actual center of the circle, of course it goes from one

115
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,067
point to another point of the circle, and it goes through

116
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:37,148
the center of the circle, we call that a diameter of a

117
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:43,333
circle. And you've probably seen this in tons of problems

118
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,467
before when we were not talking about geometry as formally,

119
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:51,067
but a diameter is made of two radiuses. We know that a radius

120
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:56,733
connects a point to the center, so you have one radius

121
00:07:56,733 --> 00:08:00,933
right over here that connects "F" and "A" that's one radius

122
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,800
and you have another radius connecting "A" and "H,"

123
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,467
a point connecting to the center of the circle. So the

124
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,667
diameter is made of these two radiuses (or radii as I

125
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:11,800
should call it I think that's the plural for radius) and so

126
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,067
the length of a diameter is going to be twice the length

127
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:18,800
of a radius. So we could say, "the length of the diameter,

128
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
so the length of "FH" (and once again I don't put the

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,067
line on top of it when I'm talking about the length) is

130
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:29,467
going to be equal to "FA," the length of segment "FA" plus

131
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:35,867
the length of segment "AH."" Now there's one last thing

132
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:39,333
I want to talk about, when we're dealing with circles,

133
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,733
and that's the idea of an arc. So we also have the parts

134
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:46,267
of the circle itself. (So let me draw another circle over

135
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:49,600
here) Let's center this circle at "B." And I'm going to find

136
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,333
some points, all the points that are a given distance

137
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,867
from "B." So, it has some radius, I'm not going to specify

138
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:01,267
it right over here. And let me pick some random points

139
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:15,400
on this circle. Let's call this, "J," "K," "S," "T," and "U."

140
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:27,200
Let me center "B" a little bit more in the center here...

141
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,733
Now, one interesting thing is, "what do you call

142
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:33,400
the length of the circle that goes between two points?"

143
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:41,467
Well, you could imagine in every language, we would

144
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:44,600
call something like that an "arc," which is also what it's

145
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,267
called in geometry. We would call this "JK," the two end

146
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:52,533
points of the arc, the two points on the circle that are

147
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:55,267
the inputs of the arc, and you would use a little notation like

148
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:59,067
that, a little curve on top instead of a strait line.

149
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,800
Now, you can also have another arc that connects "J"

150
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,600
and "K," this is called the 'minor arc,' it is the shortest

151
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,133
way upon the circle to connect "J" and "K." But you could

152
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,800
also go the other way around. You could also have this

153
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,000
thing, that goes all the around the circle. And that is

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,733
called the 'major arc.' And usually when we specify the

155
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:20,267
major arc, just to show that you're going kind of the long

156
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:23,400
way around, it's not the shortest way to go between

157
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,333
"J" and "K," you will often specify another point that you're

158
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,600
going through. So for example, this major arc we could

159
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,867
specify. We started "J," we went through, we could have

160
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:34,667
said "U," "T," or "S," but I will put "T" right over there.

161
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,933
We went through "T" and then we went all the way to "K."

162
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:41,067
And so this specifies the major arc. And this thing could

163
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:43,800
have been the same thing as if I wrote "JUK" these are

164
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,267
specifying the same thing, or "JSK." So there are

165
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,867
multiple ways to specify this major arc. The one thing I want

166
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:56,533
to make clear is that the minor arc is the shortest distance,

167
00:10:56,533 --> 00:11:02,400
so this is the minor arc, and the longer distance around is

168
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:09,000
the major arc. I will leave you there. Maybe the next few

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,867
videos we will starts playing with some of this notation.
