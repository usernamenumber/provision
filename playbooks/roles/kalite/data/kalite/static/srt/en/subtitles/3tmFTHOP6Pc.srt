1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,430
Find the sum.

3
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,710
Express the answer as a
simplified rational

4
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,250
expression, and state
the domains.

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,865
We have these two rational
expressions, or two fractions,

6
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:08,370
if you will.

7
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,790
And whenever we add fractions,
we need to find a common

8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,040
denominator, and the common
denominator has to be

9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,740
something that's divisible by
both of these denominators.

10
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,360
In general, we want to find
the least common, or the

11
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,360
smallest, multiple of these
numbers, or the smallest

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,180
number that's divisible
by both.

13
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,160
When you look at it immediately,
it might pop out

14
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,930
at you that 6 is divisible by
3, and x to the fourth is

15
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,110
definitely divisible by x
squared, so 6x to the fourth

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,260
is definitely divisible
by 3x squared.

17
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,190
Of course, it's divisible by
itself, so this actually is

18
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,630
the least common multiple-- this
is the smallest number,

19
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,410
or the smallest expression, I
guess, that is divisible by

20
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,180
both 6x to the fourth and 3x
squared, so let's make that

21
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,530
the common denominator.

22
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:56,080
So this sum is going to be
equal to 5 over 6x fourth

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,320
plus-- and now, what we want
to do is write this with 6x

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,500
fourth as the denominator, so
let me just write it again.

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,010
So plus 7 over 3x squared.

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,975
So how do we make a 3x squared
into a 6x to the fourth?

27
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:13,880
Well we're going to have to
multiply it times 2 to make

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,270
the 3 into a 6, and then we're
going to have to multiply it

29
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,350
times another x squared, so
we're going to have to

30
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,720
multiply it by 2x squared.

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,070
Now we can't just multiply only
the denominator by 2x

32
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,210
squared-- that'll fundamentally
change the value

33
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,220
of this expression.

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,220
We can only multiply it by 1,
so let's multiply it by 2x

35
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,020
squared over 2x squared-- and
we're assuming here that is x

36
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,335
is not equal to 0.

37
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:36,860
x does not equal to 0.

38
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,690
And that was actually a safe
assumption to make, that 0 is

39
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,530
not a member of our domain right
from the get go, because

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,230
that would've made either of
these expressions undefined.

41
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,180
If we assume x is not equal to
0, we can multiply by 2x

42
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,230
squared over 2x squared, and
then that will give us the

43
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:59,410
expression 5 over 6x to the
fourth, plus-- this become 7

44
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,470
times 2 is 14.

45
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,920
Fourteen x squared over 3 times
2 is 6, x to the squared

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,690
times x squared is x to the
fourth, so now we have a

47
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,640
common denominator.

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,890
The common denominator is 6x to
the fourth, and we can just

49
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,490
add the numerators, so it's 5
plus 14x squared-- or, I like

50
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,260
to write the higher degree
term first-- or 14x

51
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,580
squared plus 5.

52
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,670
And we are assuming that x does
not equal 0, because this

53
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,840
would make the expression
undefined.

54
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,880
That's about as simple as we can
make it-- we can't divide.

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,450
14 is divisible by 2, and so
6, but 5 isn't, so we can't

56
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,440
divide everything by 2, and
then, there's x squared x to

57
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,110
the fourth, but 5 has no x term
on it, so we can't divide

58
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,290
everything by x or
a power of x.

59
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,540
We're done: it's 14x squared
plus 5 over 6x to the fourth,

60
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,640
and x cannot be equal to zero.
