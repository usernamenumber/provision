1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,600
My wife is looking at me kind of strange right now. So

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,000
forgive me if I have a problem doing some of these problems.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,030
But anyway, problem 177.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,810
She said she wanted to observe me making videos.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,410
Let's see how this goes. Do you want to say hi?

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,540
No, no, OK. No, I'm not going to record it.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,390
A company accountant estimates that airfares next year for

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,690
business trips of 1,000 miles or less will increase by 20%.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,890
So less than 1,000 miles.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,780
Airfares next year going are going to go up 20%.

11
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,480
And for all other business trips, it will increase by 10%.

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,500
So essentially greater than or equal to 1,000 miles,

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,480
airfare is going to increase by 10%.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,860
This year total airfares for business trips of 1,000 miles

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,000
or less were $9,900.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,520
So that's the total for 1,000 miles or less.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,940
And airfares for all other business trips were 13,000 miles.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,300
According to the accountant's estimate, if the same number

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,730
of business trips will be made next year as this year,

20
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,030
how much will be spent for airfares next year?

21
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,400
I have a problem with what they say,

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,740
because they say the same number of business trips.

23
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,050
But we really, I'm thinking, have to assume that not only

24
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,360
are the same number of business trips made, but the

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,660
allocation between less than 1,000 and greater than 1,000

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,540
are also going to have to be the same.

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,000
But anyway, let's just do what I think they're assuming.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,970
So essentially you just have to take the $9,900 and

29
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,660
increase it by 20%. 9,900 times 1.2.

30
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,050
And then add that to the 13,000 increased by 10%.

31
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:41,220
So 1.1 times 13,000. That's a 13, not a B. So let's see.

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:51,350
Let's just write 9,900 times 1.2. 2 times 0 is 0.

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:58,450
2 times 0 is 0. 2 times 9 is 18. 2 times 9, 18, plus 1 is 19.

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,170
Add a 0 and then you have 9,900. 0, 0, 9, 9--

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:12,990
scroll down-- 0, 0, 8, 9 plus 9 is 18, 2 plus 9 is 11.

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,480
And we have one number behind the decimal. So that's 11,880.

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:27,000
And then 1.1 times 13,000. So it's 13,000 times 1.1.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:38,040
1 times 13,000 is 13,000, 0, 1 times 13,000 is 13,000.

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,020
0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 1. And we have one number behind the decimal.

40
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,050
So it's 14,300. And if we were to add these two together.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:58,450
Let's see,if I add 11,880 to this,I get 0, 8. 3 plus 8 is 11.

42
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:11,070
So, 26,180. And that's choice B. Next problem. Problem 178.

43
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:23,800
If x star y is equal to xy minus 2 times x plus y,

44
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:32,440
for all integers x and y,then what does 2 star minus 3 equal?

45
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,380
So we essentially just have to do pattern matching.

46
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,790
Everywhere we see an x here, we substitute with 2.

47
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,360
And everywhere we see a y, we substitute with minus 3.

48
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,180
And just to be clear, this isn't an equal,

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,040
that's a minus right there.

50
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:55,020
So it's 2 times minus 3, minus 2 times 2, plus minus 3.

51
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,650
2 times minus 3 is minus 6.

52
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,580
Minus 2 times 2 plus minus 3 is minus 1.

53
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,080
That's the same thing as 2 minus 3.

54
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,970
And let's see, you have a minus and a minus,

55
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,490
so we can make those both plus. So you have minus 6 plus 2.

56
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,740
When you multiply it by 1, that's the same thing.

57
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,910
So minus 6 plus 2 is equal to minus 4. And that is choice C.

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,260
Problem 179. I'll switch colors to ease the monotony.

59
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,360
179, the table above shows the number of students in the 3

60
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,270
clubs at McCullough School.

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,010
So let me write the table. So they have the club.

62
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,180
And they say the number of students.

63
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,340
And they have chess, drama, and math clubs.

64
00:04:52,330 --> 00:05:00,080
The chess club has 40 students,drama has 30, and math has 25.

65
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,270
The table above shows the number of students in 3 clubs

66
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,550
at McCullough School.

67
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,370
Although no student is in all 3 clubs,

68
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,510
10 students are in both chess and drama.

69
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,020
I feel a Venn diagram coming on.

70
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,950
10 students are in both chess and drama.

71
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,270
5 students are in both chess and math.

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,720
And 6 students are in both drama and math.

73
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,290
How many different students are there in the 3 clubs?

74
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,010
Yeah, I think we need to do a Venn diagram.

75
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,220
So let's draw the chess students first in yellow.

76
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,510
Actually I'm not going to do circles,

77
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,220
because I think I have to draw it a little bit different.

78
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,020
Because there's no students in all 3 clubs.

79
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,060
So let's say that this is the chess club.

80
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,050
There's 40 people in that. And let's do drama next.

81
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,880
There are 30 students in the drama club.

82
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,650
And then how many people are in both?

83
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,050
Well they told us that there are 10 people in chess and drama

84
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:14,000
So this is right here is 10. And then let's draw math.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,480
So math will intersect with both of these.It looks like that.

86
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,770
Math has a total of 25 students.

87
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,760
And their overlap with math and drama is 6.

88
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,280
And the overlap with math and chess is 5.

89
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,640
So the main question we have to ask is, if we were to add

90
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,100
up all of these-- if we were to add up the 40 plus the 30

91
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,700
plus the 25-- how many times are we counting

92
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,550
each of these sections?

93
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,600
So let's just try that, because we just want to know

94
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,080
the total number of students in 3 clubs.So let's take the 40.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,010
We're already counting this 10 once, right,

96
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:02,080
because they're in that 40. So let's add the 30.

97
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,520
So 40 plus 30. If we add the 40 plus the 30,

98
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,010
we're double counting this 10 that's in both clubs.

99
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,060
So if we were to subtract one of them,

100
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,990
this number right here is the number of students in the chess

101
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,930
and drama clubs, right?

102
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,710
So that is-- what is that-- that is 40 plus 30 minus 10.

103
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,410
That's 60 students. So 60 students in chess and drama.

104
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:32,980
And now if we add 25 students-- so we're adding the

105
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,900
math club to that-- who are we double counting? Now we're

106
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,100
double counting these 6 that we've already counted ,right?

107
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,420
Because we added them in the 30 from the drama club.

108
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,320
And we're also double counting these 5, which we added when

109
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,440
we first took into account the 40 from the chess club, right?

110
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,760
So since we've already counted those,

111
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,880
we need to subtract those from the 25.So minus 5 and minus 6.

112
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,410
This problem is all about not double counting.

113
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:09,050
So let's see, 60 plus 25 is 85, minus 5 is 80, minus 6 is 74.

114
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:21,010
So 74 total students. So that's choice C. Problem 180.

115
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,530
In a nationwide poll, N people were interviewed.

116
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,040
So question number one.

117
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,340
That's in the question, question number 1.

118
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,610
So it said for question number 1, 1/4 said yes.

119
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,790
And of those, 1/3 answered yes to question 2.

120
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,180
Which of the following expressions represents the number of

121
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,590
people interviewed who did not answer yes to both questions?

122
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,360
OK, so first of all,

123
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,440
you have the people who answered no to question 1.

124
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,090
So that was 3/4 of the people, right? No on question 1.

125
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,770
And who cares what they answered on question 2, right?

126
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,510
Because they definitely said no to one of the questions.

127
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,120
Because they want to say who did not answer yes to both

128
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,000
questions? So these guys fall into that category.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,610
They said no to one of the questions.

130
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,020
And then you want to say, what percentage of the total people

131
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,040
said yes on the first question and then no on the second?

132
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,630
That combination would be if 1/3 of the people who said yes

133
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,440
on the first question, said yes on the second,

134
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,700
then 2/3 said no. And what percentage,

135
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,030
or what fraction is this of the entire population?

136
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,990
Well it's 2/3 of 1/4.

137
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:50,100
So that is 2/3 times 1/4 is equal to, 1, 2.

138
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,400
That's equal to 1/6.

139
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,370
1/6 of the entire population said yes on the first

140
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,900
and no on the second.

141
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,580
So if we were to add these two up, these are people who said

142
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,480
no in either or both questions, you get 1/6 plus

143
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,540
3/4 is equal to-- let's give a common denominator of 12--

144
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:21,490
so that's 2/12 plus 3/4, that is 9/12. So that is 11/12.

145
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,830
Oh, there were N people interviewed.

146
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,640
So 11/12 of the people did not answer yes to both questions.

147
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,880
And so if they want to know the number of people,
