1
00:00:00,816 --> 00:00:02,015
In the last video

2
00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:04,094
we saw that if we had a market

3
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:05,760
with perfect competition

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,682
and if the current short-term equillibrium price

5
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:10,636
is above the price necessary

6
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,901
or is above the price at which

7
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,493
the firms would be generating economic profit

8
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:17,955
then more and more firms would start entering

9
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:20,110
because if the economic profit is positive

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,489
then that means it is a better place

11
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,883
to use your resources

12
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:25,687
than whatever your opportunity cost is

13
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:27,551
You're making profit

14
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:29,828
above and beyond your opportunity cost

15
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:31,574
so more and more enter it

16
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:32,333
so after a little bit

17
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,251
after one company enters it

18
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,749
or maybe the same firm

19
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:37,444
starts adding more seat-miles

20
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:38,847
or adding more planes

21
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:40,503
we have another short-term supply curve

22
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:41,602
that looks like that

23
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:42,702
and then a new equilibrium price

24
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:44,132
that's a little bit lower

25
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:45,451
and a new equilibrium quantity

26
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,947
that's a little bit higher

27
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,185
and that keeps happening

28
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:50,849
still your equilibrium price was higher

29
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:52,864
than your price necessary

30
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:54,294
for a normal profit

31
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:56,699
or a zero economic profit

32
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,297
and so more people enter still

33
00:00:58,297 --> 00:00:59,145
and so we have another

34
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:00,814
short term supply curve

35
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:02,364
and we move further to

36
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:03,982
the bottom right of this demand curve

37
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,340
and then it keeps happening

38
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,967
until we have a supply curve

39
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,896
where the equilibrium price

40
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:12,051
where this new short term equilibrium price

41
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,498
is the same as the price

42
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:16,246
at which everyone is making a normal profit

43
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:19,196
or the price needed for zero economic profit.

44
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:20,159
at that point

45
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,064
people are neutral

46
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,258
whether they drop out

47
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:24,955
or enter into the market

48
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:27,356
and so the quantity remains stable

49
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:28,558
and so that's why

50
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:30,639
we view each of these curves over here

51
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:33,035
as our short run supply curves

52
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:36,627
but this line right over here

53
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:37,188
we do in yellow

54
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:38,184
this line over here

55
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:40,303
we've talked about this in previous videos

56
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:41,649
that's why this line over here

57
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:43,829
we call the long run supply curve

58
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,514
because depending on

59
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:47,143
whether the equilibrium price

60
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:48,729
is above or below this

61
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:50,060
at some point the supply

62
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,756
will enter or exit the system

63
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:53,440
so that we eventually get back

64
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,576
to some point

65
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:58,346
along this long run supply curve right over here

66
00:01:58,346 --> 00:02:00,207
Now this was assuming perfect competition

67
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:01,102
many players

68
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,070
identical products

69
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,723
identical air travel

70
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,626
no barriers to entry

71
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,251
Let's think about what happens

72
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:09,225
if we have the exact opposite

73
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,785
of perfect competition

74
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,280
so we're gonna start at the same point

75
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,219
we're gonna start there

76
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,102
so we're gonna start

77
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:15,367
at the green supply curve

78
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,128
and we have this red demand

79
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:18,417
this orange demand curve

80
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,419
but let's say that instead of

81
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,653
having perfect competition

82
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:22,553
we live in a country where they say

83
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:24,091
and there are countries like this

84
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:25,147
where they say

85
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:26,835
there is only one air carrier

86
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:27,804
that can do business

87
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:29,133
it is the national air carrier

88
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,999
in our country

89
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,462
so instead of many players

90
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:35,647
we now have one player

91
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,227
and then obviously it's an identical product

92
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:38,559
well they only sell one product

93
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,657
one player

94
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:41,191
HUGE barriers to entry

95
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:42,075
no one else

96
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,115
you can also say infinite barriers to entry

97
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:45,346
no one else by law

98
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,022
is allowed to enter into this

99
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:48,896
I'm going into the extreme case

100
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:53,207
and obviously there is the ultimate advantage

101
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,859
for the existing player

102
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:56,103
they are the one that the government

103
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:57,659
the only one that the government

104
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,676
is allowing to participate

105
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:01,012
and price information

106
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:02,002
we dont really care about

107
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,285
there's only one price quote

108
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:04,426
coming from one player.

109
00:03:04,426 --> 00:03:05,557
Now when we do that

110
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:07,036
when we talk about one player

111
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:08,643
as the only player in the market

112
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:09,697
we are not talking about

113
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:10,996
perfect competition

114
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:19,877
we are then talking about a monopoly

115
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:22,043
And it is the same word as

116
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:24,498
perhaps one of your favorite board games

117
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:25,733
and that comes from

118
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,126
the point of that board game

119
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:28,747
is to own all of the properties

120
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:29,843
of one of those colors

121
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,454
so at least in the framework of that board game

122
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:33,809
the Monopoly board game

123
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:36,005
you know the Parker Brothers board game

124
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:38,825
you have a monopoly on the blue

125
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,495
you know if you own park place and boardwalk

126
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:41,730
you have a monopoly

127
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,475
on that part of the market

128
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:44,595
so thats what you'll try to do.

129
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:45,942
when you have a monopoly

130
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:48,343
you can then charge higher prices

131
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:50,955
for when someone lands on your space

132
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:52,274
and something very similar

133
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,448
will happen here

134
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:55,496
now we only have one player

135
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:56,636
and lets say that right now

136
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,976
the equilibrium price

137
00:03:57,976 --> 00:03:59,944
is higher than the price you need

138
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:02,072
to have zero economic profit

139
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:03,287
so we have one player

140
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:04,514
and that player is definitely

141
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:07,173
getting some seriou economic profit

142
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:08,703
well, they could just sit there

143
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:10,340
because no one else can enter

144
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,172
you're not gonna have this trend

145
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:13,402
where more and more supply

146
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:14,351
gets on the market

147
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,938
until you get to this

148
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:18,463
long run supply curve

149
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:19,585
in fact there will not be

150
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:21,167
this long run supply curve

151
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,657
the long run supply curve is

152
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:25,282
whatever frankly the monopolists decide

153
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:26,045
they want to do

154
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:26,868
if this is where

155
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:28,422
their profits are optimized

156
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:29,288
theyll do there

157
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:30,179
In fact they could even

158
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:31,204
go the other direction

159
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,185
even though they're already

160
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:33,547
making some economic profit

161
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:34,570
they might determine

162
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,567
"Hey we could make even more economic profit

163
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,034
if we lowered the quantity offered even more."

164
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:40,000
so they might even

165
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,930
take supply out of the market

166
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,707
and so they could have a new supply curve

167
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:44,982
that looks like this

168
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:46,376
we have a new equilibrium price

169
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:47,695
that is even higher

170
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:49,717
and is at a lower equilibrium quantity

171
00:04:49,717 --> 00:04:50,609
they could even do more

172
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:52,381
they could raise price even more

173
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:55,166
and so you have a new equilibrium price

174
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,111
that is up here

175
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:58,380
and a lower equilibrium quantity

176
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,229
So clearly when you have a monopoly

177
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,198
something not so good is happening

178
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:03,216
for the consumer

179
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:04,375
they are able to raise price

180
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,715
it's actually not even efficient

181
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:07,899
because the optimal quantity

182
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,293
is not being produced

183
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:11,547
but I want to leave you there

184
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:12,801
and maybe leave you with

185
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:13,978
something to think about

186
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:15,433
I said that the monopolist now

187
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,263
because they dont have to worry about

188
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:17,997
other people entering in

189
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:19,822
to kind of lower the price

190
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:22,016
and get to this normal profit line

191
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:23,486
because they dont have to worry about that

192
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:24,897
they can set their quantity

193
00:05:24,897 --> 00:05:26,018
to whatever they want

194
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:27,000
or I guess another way you could think about it

195
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,221
they could set their price to

196
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:29,370
whatever they want

197
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,864
and get the corresponding quantity

198
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,080
but the question is how do they set that

199
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,417
how do they determine

200
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:36,887
where along this curve

201
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:38,184
that they would like to

202
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:39,320
either set the price

203
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,587
or I guess you could say

204
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:41,404
set the quantity

205
00:05:41,404 --> 99:59:59,999
by limiting production in some way
