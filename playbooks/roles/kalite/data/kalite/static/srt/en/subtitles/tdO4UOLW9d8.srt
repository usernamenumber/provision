1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,230
Simplify n squared r
to the fifth n to

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,680
the negative seventh.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,040
Express your answer in
exponential form

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,260
with positive exponents.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,120
Let me just rewrite what
they have up there.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,290
So we have n squared
r to the fifth n to

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,540
the negative seventh.

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,620
So the easiest way to simplify
this, I would say kind of just

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,330
while we were multiplying them,
group the common bases.

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,240
So we have two exponent
expressions with n as a base.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,360
We have n squared and we have
n to the negative seventh.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,230
So let me just rearrange this
multiplication right here.

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,500
I can rewrite this as n squared
n to the negative

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,940
seven and then we have
our r to the fifth.

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,930
And what's this going
to be equal to?

17
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,200
Well we have n squared times
n to the negative seven.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,650
We can add those
two exponents.

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,840
So this right here would
simplify to n

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,300
to the 2 minus 7.

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,600
2 minus 7 is negative 5.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,850
N to the negative 5,
r to the fifth.

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,660
Now we've simplified this
about as much as we can.

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,240
But, we're not done yet.

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,470
Because they said express your
answer in exponential form

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,240
with positive exponents.

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,350
This is a negative
exponent here.

28
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,610
This is not acceptable,
at least based on what

29
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,680
they asked us to do.

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,760
So we know that n to the
negative fifth is the same

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,510
thing as 1 over n
to the fifth.

32
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,720
So we can just rewrite
it the that way.

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,100
So this is the same thing
as 1 over n to the fifth

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,670
times r to the fifth.

35
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,210
Or we could say this is equal
to r to the fifth

36
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,600
over n to the fifth.

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,200
And this is about as simple
as you can you can get.

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,100
If you wanted to do other things
here you could say that

39
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,110
this is equal to r over
n to the fifth.

40
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,710
Since both of these are being
raised to the fifth power.

41
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,130
But this is probably what
they want here.

42
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,120
We've simplified it and all of
the exponents are now positive

43
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,330
because we put the n
in the denominator.

44
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,200
