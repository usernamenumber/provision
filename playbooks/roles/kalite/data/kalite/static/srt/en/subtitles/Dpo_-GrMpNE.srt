1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:08,406
Use a calcuator to find log base e of 67 to the nearest thousandth

2
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:12,133
So just as a reminder, e is one of these crazy numbers that shows up

3
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:18,971
in natures and finance and all these things and it is approximately equal to 2.71 and it just keeps on and on

4
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:25,031
so you could view log

5
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:27,818
base is as 67 and you say "What does 'e' mean?" Well, e is just a number

6
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:31,231
just like pi is just a number

7
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,903
This is really the same thing as saying log base 2.71 and teh actual number

8
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:36,734
so you have to write all the digits that just keep on going forever

9
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:40,240
and never repeat- of 67. So what power do I have to raise e to

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,491
to get to 67? So another way of saying that is that if this is

11
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:50,302
equal to x, e to the x is equal to 67, we need to figure out what x is

12
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:56,819
Now, traditionally, you will never see people write log base e even though

13
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:01,231
e is one of the most common bases to take a log of

14
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:04,667
so the reason you wouldn't see log base e written this way

15
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:08,333
is that log base e is the natural logarithm

16
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,267
and I think that's used because e shows up so many times in nature.

17
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:17,933
So log base e of 67, another way of saying that- or seeing that- and the more typical

18
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:24,242
way of seeing that is the natural log. This is ln (I think this is from french or something)

19
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:30,233
So this is the same thing as saying log base e

20
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:33,067
of 67. This is saying that exact same thing.

21
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:38,313
So what power do I have to raise e to to get 67. When you see this 'ln', is literally means

22
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:42,307
'log base e'. Now, they let us use a calculator and that's good

23
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:46,556
because I don't know off the top of my head what power you

24
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:50,736
have to raise 2.71 and so forth to to get 67.

25
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:54,567
So we'll get our calculator out. So we'll get our TI-85 out.

26
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:58,333
And different calculators will have different ways of doing it.

27
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:02,133
If you have a graphing calulator like this, you can literally type in the

28
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,267
statement, natural log of 67 and evaluate it.

29
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:11,239
So here, this is the button for natural log, 'log naturale (fr),' maybe.

30
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,070
Ln of 67, and then you press 'enter' and it will give you the answer.

31
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,000
If you don't have a graphing calculator, you might have to press 67

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,067
and then press 'ln' to give you the answer. But if you have

33
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:26,933
a graphing calculator you can jsut type it in the same

34
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:29,560
way as you would write it out.

35
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,400
So 4.20469... and we want to roud to the nearest thousandth.

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,133
So this is the thousandth place, this 4, the digit after that is 5

37
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,267
or larger, it's a 6, so we are going to round up.

38
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:49,067
So this is approximately equal to 4.205

39
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:53,933
and it actualy makes a lot of sense, because we know that e is greater than 2

40
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:58,200
and it is less than 3

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,740
and if you think about 2 to the 4th power, that gets you to 16

42
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,894
and 3 to the fourth power gets you to 81.

43
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:13,562
67 is between 16 and 81, and e is between 2 and 3

44
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:16,650
so at least if feels right

45
00:03:16,650 --> 99:59:59,999
that 2.71^4 should get you pretty close to 3^4.
