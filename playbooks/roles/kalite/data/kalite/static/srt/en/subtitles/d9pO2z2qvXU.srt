00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:04,233
Which of the following real numbers are irrational?

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:06,637
Well, irrational just means it's not rational.

3
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:08,889
It means that you cannot express it

4
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:11,042
as the ratio of two integers.

5
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:12,775
So let's see what we have here.

6
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,633
So we have the square root of eight over two .

7
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:16,236
So the square root of eight –

8
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:18,042
If you take the square root of a number

9
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:19,637
that is not a perfect square,

10
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:21,303
it is going to be irrational.

11
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:23,289
And then if you just take that irrational number,

12
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,295
and you multiply it, or you divided it

13
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:26,577
by any other numbers,

14
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:28,253
you're still going to get an irrational number.

15
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,250
So, the square root of eight is irrational.

16
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,672
[Even if] you divide that by two, it is still irrational.

17
00:00:32,672 --> 00:00:34,755
So this is not rational.

18
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:36,970
Or another way of saying it – it is irrational.

19
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,769
Now you have pi.

20
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:42,436
3.14159 and It just keeps going on and on and on forever –

21
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:44,034
without ever repeating.

22
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:46,837
So, this is irrational –

23
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:49,253
probably the most famous of all the irrational numbers.

24
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:51,102
5.0.

25
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:55,302
Well, I can represent 5.0 as five over one.

26
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:57,289
So, 5.0 is rational.

27
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,033
It is not irrational.

28
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:02,149
0.325.

29
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:08,483
Well, this is the same thing as 325 over 1000.

30
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:10,884
So, I can clearly represent it as a ratio of integers.

31
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:12,364
So, this is rational –

32
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,952
just as I could represent 5.0 as five over one –

33
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:16,824
both of these are rational.

34
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:18,151
They are not irrational.

35
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:22,031
Here I have 7.7777 –

36
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,024
and just keeps going on and on and on and on forever.

37
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:25,619
And the way we denote that –

38
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,160
You could just say these dots that say

39
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,697
that the sevens keep going.

40
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:30,552
Or you could say 7.7 – and this line

41
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:32,783
shows the seven part – the second seven –

42
00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:34,779
just keeps repeating on forever.

43
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:37,190
Now, if you have a repeating decimal –

44
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,441
In other videos, we'll actually convert them into fractions.

45
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:43,863
But a repeating decimal can be represented

46
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:47,289
as a ratio of two integers –

47
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:52,941
just as one third is equal to 0.333 – on and on and on.

48
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:54,088
Or I could say it like this:

49
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:56,356
I could say three repeating.

50
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:58,108
We can also do the same thing for that.

51
00:01:58,108 --> 00:01:59,605
I won't do it here.

52
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:03,723
But this is rational – so it's not irrational.

53
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,373
8 1/2?

54
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:06,622
Well, that's the same thing –

55
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:09,629
8 1/2 is the same thing as 17 halves (17/2).

56
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,508
So, it's clearly rational.

57
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:13,544
So, the only two irrational numbers

58
00:02:13,544 --> 00:02:16,135
are the first two right over here.
