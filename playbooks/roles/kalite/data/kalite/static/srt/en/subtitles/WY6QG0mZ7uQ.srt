1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
   

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,260
I want to make a quick
correction or clarification to

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,540
the last video that you may or
may not have found confusing.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,420
You may not have noticed it,
but when I did the general

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,090
case for multiplying a row by a
scalar, I had this situation

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,240
where I had the matrix A and I
defined it as-- it was n by n

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,560
matrix, so it was a11, a12,
all the way to a1n.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,970
Then we went down this way.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,220
Then we picked a particular row
i, so we called that ai1,

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,410
ai2, all the way to ain.

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,065
And then we keep going down ,
assuming that this is the last

12
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:40,250
row, so an1 all the
way to ann.

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,500
When I wanted to find the
determinant of A, and this is

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,770
where I made a-- I would call
it a notational error.

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,360
When I wanted to find the
determinant of A, I wrote that

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,460
it was equal to-- well, we could
go down, and in that

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,010
video, I went down this row.

18
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,350
That's why I kind of highlighted
it to begin with,

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,770
and I wrote it down.

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,370
So it's equal to-- do the
checkerboard pattern.

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,610
I said negative 1
to the i plus j.

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,640
Well, let's do the first term.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:16,240
I plus 1 times ai1 times
its submatrix.

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,750
That's what I wrote in the last.
So if you have ai1, if

25
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,810
you get rid of that row, that
column, you have the submatrix

26
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,550
right there: ai1.

27
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,550
That's what I wrote
in the last video,

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,970
but that was incorrect.

29
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,050
And I think when I did the 2 by
2 case and the 3 by 3 case,

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,000
that's pretty clear.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,780
It's not times the matrix, it's
times the determinant of

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,420
the submatrix, so this right
here is incorrect.

33
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,770
And, of course, you keep adding
that to-- and I wrote

34
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,520
ai2 times its submatrix
like that.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,620
ai2 all the way to ain
times its submatrix.

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,560
That's what I did
in the video.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,780
That's incorrect.

38
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,250
Let me do the incorrect in a
different color to show that

39
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,680
this is all one thing.

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,960
I should have said the
determinant of each of these.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,200
The determinant of A is equal
to minus 1 to the i plus 1

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:16,180
times ai1 times the determinant
of ai1 plus ai2

43
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,440
times the determinant of ai2,
the determinant of the

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,440
submatrix all the way to ain
times the determinant of the

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,440
submatrix ain.

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,890
It doesn't change the logic of
the proof much, but I just

47
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,910
want to be very careful that
we're not multiplying the

48
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,850
submatrices because
that becomes a

49
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,630
fairly complicated operation.

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,260
Well, it's not that bad.

51
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,820
It's a scalar.

52
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,630
But when we find a determinant,
we're multiplying

53
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,360
times the determinant
of the submatrix.

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,850
We saw that when we first
defined it using the recursive

55
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,760
definition for the n by n
determinant, but I just wanted

56
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,230
to make that very clear.

57
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,399
