1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,979
I want to talk about direct and inverse variations

2
00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:08,036
I´ll do direct variations on the left over here

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:15,274
And I´ll do inverse variations or two variables that vary inversly on the right hand side over here

4
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:19,783
So a very simple definition for two variables that vary directly

5
00:00:19,783 --> 00:00:23,266
would be something like this

6
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:27,260
Y varies directly with X if y is equal to some constant with x

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,600
we could rewrite this in kind of english

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:39,267
y varies directly with x

9
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:43,700
if this constant seems strange to you

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,183
remember this could be literally any constant number

11
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:49,598
so let me give a bunch of examples that would also

12
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:53,174
or particular examples of y varies directly with x

13
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:56,285
you cold have Y is equal to X

14
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:59,954
because of the situation the constant is 1, we didn´t even write it

15
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:02,694
you could have write Y is equal to 1X, then K is 1

16
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:05,434
we could write Y is equal to 2X

17
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:08,452
we could write Y is equal to one half X

18
00:01:08,452 --> 00:01:11,935
we could write Y is equal to negative 2X

19
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:14,165
we are still variating directly

20
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:18,112
we could write Y is equal to negative one half X

21
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:22,617
we could have Y is equal to π times X

22
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:26,100
we could have Y is equal to negative π times X

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,840
You get the point

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,951
Any constant times X, we are varying directly

25
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:35,248
And to understand this maybe a little bit more tanginbly

26
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:38,592
let´s think about what happens and let´s pick one of these scenarios

27
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:41,843
I´ll take a positive version and a negative version

28
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:43,933
just because it might not be completely intuitive

29
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,115
So let´s take the version of Y is equal to 2X

30
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:51,333
and let´s explore why we say they vary directly with each other

31
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,333
so let´s pick a couple of values for X

32
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,933
and see what the resulting Y value would have to be

33
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:03,855
so if X is equal to 1, then Y is two times 1, so it´s 2

34
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:10,264
if X is equal to 2, then Y is 2 times 2, which is going to be equal to 4

35
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:17,601
So when we doubled X, from 1 to 2, so we doubled X, the same thing happened to Y

36
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:24,242
We doubled Y, so that´s what it means when something varies directly

37
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:29,258
If we scale X up by a certain amount, we are going to scale up Y

38
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:30,698
by the same amount

39
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:34,924
If we scale down X by a certain amount, we would scale down Y by the same amount

40
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:37,431
And just to show you it works with all of these

41
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:40,914
let´s try the situation with Y is equal to negative 2X

42
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:43,608
I´ll do it in magenta

43
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:50,689
Y is equal to ..., I´ll do a new example, let´s try Y is equal to negative 3X

44
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:57,470
so once again, let me do my X and my Y

45
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,789
when X is equal to 1, Y is equal to negative 3 times 1, which is negative 3

46
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:08,383
when X is equal to 2, negative 3 times 2 is negative 6

47
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:17,114
so notice, we multiplied, so if we scaled, let me do that in the same green colour

48
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,783
if we scale up X by 2, it´s a different green colour but it serves the purpose

49
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,312
we are also scaling up Y by 2, to go from 1 to 2, we multiply by 2

50
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:29,467
to go from negative 3 to negative 6, you´re also multiplying by 2

51
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:34,204
so we grew by the same scaling factor, and if you want to get the other way

52
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:48,136
let´s say we try, X is 1/3, if X is 1/3 then Y is going to be negative 3 times 1/3, is negative 1

53
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:53,200
so to go from 1 to 1/3, we divide by 3

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,053
to go from negative 3 to negative 1, we also divide by 3

55
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:00,118
we also scale down by a factor of 3

56
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:05,458
so whatever direction you scale X in you are going to have the same scaling direction as Y

57
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,477
that´s what it means to vary directly

58
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:12,378
now it´s not laways so clear

59
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,771
sometimes it would be ofuscated

60
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:18,043
so you could write, so let´s take this example right over here

61
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:21,867
Y is equal to negative 3X, (I´m saving this real state for inverse variation in a second)

62
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:25,200
you could writethis or you could algebraically manipulate it

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,307
you could maybe divide both sides of this equation by X

64
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:34,112
and then you will get Y/X is equal to -3

65
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:36,944
or maybe you divide both sides by X

66
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,452
and then you divide both sides by Y

67
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:42,842
so from this you would get, so if you divide both sides by Y now

68
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:47,933
you could get 1/X is equal to negative 3 times 1/Y

69
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:52,595
these three statements, these three equations are all the same thing

70
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:55,938
so sometimes the direct variation isn´t quite in your face

71
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:59,607
but if you do this, what I did right here with any of these

72
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:01,604
you would get the exact same result

73
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:04,948
or you could jus try to manipulate it back, to this form over here

74
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:07,595
and there´s other ways we could do it

75
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:09,777
we could divide both sides of this equation by negative 3

76
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:13,911
and then you would get negative 1/3Y is equal to X

77
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:17,440
and this is kind of an interesting case here

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,109
because here this is X varies directly with Y

79
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:24,778
or we could say X is equal to some K times Y

80
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:26,264
and in general that´s true

81
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:34,112
if Y varies directly with X, though we can also say that X varies directly with Y

82
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:38,245
it´s not going to be the same constant, it´s going to be essentially the inverse of that constant

83
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:40,614
but they´re still directly varying

84
00:05:40,614 --> 00:05:43,586
now with that said so about direct variation

85
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:45,267
let´s explore inverse variation

86
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:49,576
inverse variation the general form (if we use the same variables)

87
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:52,502
it always doesn´t have to be Y and X, it could be A and a B

88
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:55,196
it could be a M and an N

89
00:05:55,196 --> 00:06:05,273
now to inverse varitaion, so if I did it with Ys and Xs

90
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,595
this would be Y is equal to some constant (K) times 1/X

91
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:14,608
so instead of being some constant times X, it´s some constant times 1/X

92
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,512
so let me show you a bunch of examples

93
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:18,601
it could be Y is equal to 1/X

94
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:22,920
it could be Y is equal to 2 times 1/X

95
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,567
which is clearly the same thing as 2/X

96
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:31,279
it could be Y is equal to 1/3 times 1/X

97
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,927
whis is the same thing as 1/3X

98
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:39,000
it could be Y is equal to -2/X

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,911
and let´s explore this, the inverse variation the same way we explain the direct variation

100
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:48,276
so let´s pick Y is equal to 2/X

101
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:55,614
and let me do that same table over here

102
00:06:55,614 --> 00:07:02,766
if X is 1, then Y is 2

103
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:07,267
if X is 2 then 2 divided by 2 is 1

104
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,453
so if you multiply X by 2

105
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:12,379
you scale it up by a factor of 2, what happens to Y?

106
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,304
Y gets scaled down by a factor of 2

107
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,301
you divide it by 2 now

108
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:18,533
notice the difference?

109
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:22,178
here however we scale X, we sacled up Y by the same amount

110
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:24,933
now if we scale up X by a factor

111
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:30,119
when we have inverse variation, we are scaling down Y by the same

112
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,467
so that´s were the inverse is coming from

113
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,716
and we could go the other way

114
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,853
id we made X is equal to 1/2

115
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:42,704
so if we were to scale down X, we are going to see that this is going to scale up Y

116
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:44,887
´cause 2 divided by 1/2 is 4

117
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:47,441
so here we are scaling up Y

118
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,206
so they are going to do the opposite things

119
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:55,196
they vary inverse, and you could try it with the negative way of it as well

120
00:07:55,196 --> 00:07:58,215
so here we are multiplying by 2

121
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:00,537
and once again it is not always neatly written for you like this

122
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:04,299
it could be rearranged in a bunch different ways

123
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:09,546
but it will still be inverse variation as long as they are algebraically equivalent

124
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:13,215
so you could multiply both side of this equation right here by X

125
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:20,878
and you would get XY is equal to 2, this is also inverse variation

126
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:22,782
you would get this exact same table over here

127
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:30,769
you could divide both sides of this equation by Y and you could X is equal to 2/Y

128
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:33,788
which is also the same thing as 2 times 1/Y

129
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:36,800
so notice Y varies inversely with X

130
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,868
and you could just manipulate this algebraically to show that X varies inversely with Y

131
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:50,135
so Y varies inversely with X

132
00:08:50,135 --> 00:09:00,770
this is the same thing (as seen in this example) as saying that X varies inveresely with Y

133
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,116
and there is other things

134
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:04,531
we could take this and divide both sides by 2

135
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:07,550
and you would get Y/2 is equal to 1/X

136
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,547
there´s all sort of crazy things

137
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:13,540
so in general if you see an expression that relates two variables

138
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,209
and they say do they vary inversely or directly or maybe neither

139
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:20,042
you could either try to make a table like this

140
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:24,640
if you scale up X by certain amount and Y gets scaled up by the same amount

141
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,544
that is direct variation

142
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:31,188
if you scale up X, you may want to try it a couple of different times

143
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:35,878
and you scale down Y, do the opposite with Y, then it is probably inverse variation

144
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:42,798
a sure way to know what you´re dealing with

145
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:46,791
it´s to actually algebraically manipulate the equation so it gets back to either this form

146
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,788
that tells you it´s inverse variation

147
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:52,932
or this form, which will tell you that it is direct variation
