1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,070
Now our probability problems
will get a little bit

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,860
more interesting.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,700
So let's say I have a
bag full of coins.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,360
So this is my bag of coins,
maybe it's a bowl of coins.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,690
From a bunch of coins in there.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,820
I didn't need to draw
it, but I did anyway.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,510
And let's say that I know that
9 of these coins are normal.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,390
So what do I mean my normal?

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,210
Just, you know, let's say
they're quarters and they have

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,580
a heads and a tails, and that
there's a 50% chance of getting

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,260
a heads or 50% chance of
a tails if you flip

12
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,640
any of those coins.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,090
And then, 1 of the coins
is a two-sided head coin.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,110
So essentially, no matter
what you flip it, it's

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,070
going to be a heads.

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,740
So I have this bag, what I'm
going to do is I'm going to

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,820
blindfold myself, stick my
hand in the bag, and

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,380
pick a coin out.

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,230
And then I'm going to flip
that coin, I'm going

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,950
to flip it five times.

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,590
And my question to you is,
what is the probability that

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,515
I get all 5 to be heads?

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,400
So whenever you see something
unfamiliar it'll always work--

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,620
maybe we'll do a tree or we'll
do a hybrid of a probability

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,500
tree or something else.

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,630
But you say, well, at the very
beginning of this experiment

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,720
something happens.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm going to pick a
coin out of this bag.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,350
And so you could say that
there's a-- well, how

30
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,050
many coins are there?

31
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,630
There's 10 coins and I have an
equal probability of picking

32
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,355
any one of the coins.

33
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:43,690
Let's say I can't feel
whether it's heads or tails.

34
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,250
I'm doing it with gloves
on, so I can't feel out

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,280
the two-sided coin.

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,150
Take my word for it, there's
an equal probability to take

37
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,440
any 1 of these 10 coins.

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,370
There's 9 normal, 1 weird
with 2 heads on it.

39
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,320
So what's the probability
that I get a normal coin?

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,860
   

41
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,530
Well, there are 9 normal
coins out of the 10 equally

42
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,830
likely coins I could get.

43
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,560
So the probability of a
normal is 9 out of 10.

44
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,755
So there's a 9 out of 10 chance
that this is a normal coin

45
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:18,890
Let's just call that normal.

46
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,560
And then, what's the
probability that I get

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,930
a-- let's call it a
2s-- two-sided coin.

48
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,080
I'll call it 2s.

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,800
Well, that's just 1 out of 10.

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,670
I'm either going to
get this or that.

51
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,060
I'm not going to take nothing
out of the bag I assume.

52
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,630
OK, so this is a 1/10 chance
that I get a two-sided coin.

53
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,280
And then whichever coin
I get I'm going to flip

54
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,620
it five times in a row.

55
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,010
And I'm not going to do
the tree here because

56
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,720
to drew a tree I'd have
32 nodes on each side.

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,450
But given this, given
the normal, what is

58
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,220
now the probability of
getting 5 in a row?

59
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,110
The way I'm going to write that
is the probability of 5 heads--

60
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,690
or I could have written 5
out of 5 heads, whatever.

61
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,120
And then this upper line, this
means given-- given that

62
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,370
I have a normal coin.

63
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,620
So if I can assume that I had a
normal coin, what are the

64
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,180
probabilities that my next 5--
so I'll say this is

65
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,330
5 out of 5 heads.

66
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,380
Well, we figure that out.

67
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,900
Each time there's a 1/2
probability and I'm going

68
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,520
to do it 5 in a row.

69
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,800
So it's 1/2 to the fifth,
which equals 1/32.

70
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,440
So the probability that I get
5 out of 5 heads given a

71
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,280
normal coin is 1 out of 32.

72
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,570
Fair enough.

73
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:47,520
Well, what's the probability
of 5 out of 5 heads,

74
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,890
given the two-sided coin?

75
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,750
And now just is this random
notation I'm coming

76
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,370
with the two-sided.

77
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,960
But this upwards and downwards
line, this vertical

78
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,310
line, that means given.

79
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,490
I mean I could flip this coin
a million times and all of

80
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,830
them are going to be heads.

81
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,630
So the probability
here is 1 out of 1.

82
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,380
I'm definitely going
to get a heads here.

83
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,770
So all I asked initially is,
what is the probability that

84
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,190
I get 5 out of 5 heads?

85
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,730
Well, this is going to be equal
to-- and I'll switch colors

86
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,510
arbitrarily here just to
keep things interesting.

87
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:36,230
This is going to be equal to
the probability that you get 5

88
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:44,400
out of 5 heads given-- let's
call that a normal coin-- given

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,170
a normal coin times the
probability that you had a

90
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,110
normal coin times
the probability of

91
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,740
let's say normal.

92
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,090
Plus-- and I'm running a little
out of space-- the probability

93
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:06,390
that you get 5 out of 5 heads
given the two-sided coin times

94
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,660
the probability that you had
the two-sided sided coin.

95
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,710
Hopefully that makes sense and
you kind of think of it in this

96
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,140
way, what is the probability
of getting to this outcome?

97
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,510
It is the probability that you
picked a normal coin and then,

98
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,780
given the normal coin,
there's a 1 in 32 chance

99
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,630
that you got there.

100
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,670
So it'd be 1 out of 32
times the chance you've

101
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,520
got the normal coin.

102
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,340
So 9 out of 10.

103
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,820
And what's the probability
of getting here?

104
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,700
What's the probability you had
to-- and, in general, in a

105
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,390
tree, you just have to multiply
all of the nodes to get to that

106
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,400
point to figure out what's the
probability of getting there.

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,000
And I think if you watched
the first few videos it make

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,690
sense why that happens.

109
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,090
So what's the
probability of this?

110
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,490
Well, there's a 1/10 chance
that you picked the

111
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,670
two-sided coin.

112
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,410
And then of course, you're
guaranteed to get all heads.

113
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,870
This is 1 times 1/10.

114
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,550
And all I did here and
here is the same thing

115
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,440
that I wrote up here.

116
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,990
Let me switch colors.

117
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:09,720
So what is this, the
probability of 5 out of 5 heads

118
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,290
given a normal coin times the
probability of a normal coin?

119
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,320
Well, that's just this.

120
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,620
This is the probability of 5
out of 5 heads given the normal

121
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,260
coin times the probability
of a normal coin.

122
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,340
And this is equal to what?

123
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,590
9/320.

124
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,230
And then this, the probability
of 5 out of 5 heads given the

125
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,810
two-sided coin times the
probability of the

126
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,980
two-sided coin.

127
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,970
Well, this is the probability
of 5 out of 5 heads given

128
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,400
the two-sided coin, you're
guaranteed to get 5 out of 5.

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,260
And the probability of
getting a two-sided

130
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,560
coin is 1 out of 10.

131
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,620
This is this.

132
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,850
So this is equal to 1/10.

133
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,070
So my probability of just
putting my hand in the bag,

134
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,630
taking out a random coin and
then flipping it five times and

135
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:57,270
getting all 5 heads, is going
to be equal to this plus this.

136
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,100
So it's 9/320.

137
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,180
plus 1/10.

138
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,433
But let's make
that so it's 320.

139
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:12,320
That's 32/320.

140
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,790
So 9 plus 32 is 41/320.

141
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,560
So that's interesting.

142
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,390
But now let me ask you even a
more interesting question.

143
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,390
This is why I think what we've
learned so far is useful.

144
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,120
Let's say that I do
get 5 out of 5 heads.

145
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,370
So I know that I got
5 out of 5 heads.

146
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,910
So let me clear this up a
little bit just because I think

147
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,540
it's getting over-- So let's
say that I do get

148
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,980
5 out of 5 heads.

149
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,140
What is the probability that
I picked the two-sided coin?

150
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,570
So what we're asking is, what
is the probability that I

151
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,080
picked the two-sided coin,
given that I got 5

152
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,990
out of 5 heads?

153
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,290
And I hope you understand
what I mean here.

154
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,380
Before we said, oh, for
example, I hope you see the

155
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,660
difference between this and
what is the probability of

156
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,840
getting 5 out of 5 heads,
given the two-sided coin.

157
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,210
If I know I have a two-sided
coin, I know that the

158
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,500
probability is equal to 1.

159
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,710
I know that I'm guaranteed
to get 5 heads.

160
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,430
But this is a little
bit more interesting.

161
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,650
If I flip a coin five times in
a row and I get a bunch of

162
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,600
heads, I'll say, well, I either
got maybe really lucky with a

163
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,350
normal coin or I picked
the two-sided coin.

164
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,110
And I don't know which
one happened, so

165
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,030
there's a probability.

166
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,430
And of course, the more times
you get a heads, just

167
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,820
intuitively, if I got 100 heads
in a row I'll say, well, I

168
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,340
probably picked the two-sided
coin without actually just

169
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,140
looking at the coin.

170
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,000
We're assuming that
that's not acceptable.

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,680
And if I got a million heads in
a row we'd be really, really

172
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,370
sure that we picked the
two-sided coin, but we're

173
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,380
not completely sure.

174
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,940
There's some probability that I
picked the fair coin and it

175
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,690
just happened to get heads
a million times in a row.

176
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,170
So how do we think about this?

177
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,500
Well, I'll do it analytically
and I'll draw it out, and

178
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,400
hopefully, both of them
will make sense to you.

179
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,950
And I'll probably have to
do it in the next video.

180
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,672
I'll see you soon.
