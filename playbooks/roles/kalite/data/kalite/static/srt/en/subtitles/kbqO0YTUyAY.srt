1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,085
Once again we have three identical objects

2
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:10,033
they all have the same mass,
but we don't know what the mass is.

3
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:13,005
But we do know that if you total up their mass,

4
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:16,488
it is the same exact mass 
as these nine objects.

5
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:19,633
and each of these 9 masses
have a mass of exactly 1 kilogram.

6
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:22,014
So we have a total of 9 kg on this side,

7
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:24,300
and over here we have 3 objects that all have the same mass

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,030
but we don't know what that mass is,
we are just calling that mass 'X'.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,909
What I want to do is to tackle this a bit more symbolically.

10
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:37,100
In the last video, we said "hey, why don't we just multiply 1/3 of this and 1/3 of that?"

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,367
and then we would keep things balanced.

12
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:44,500
keeping 1/3 of the same mass, so this total is the same as this one.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,813
and that is why the scale is balanced.

14
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,343
Now, let's think about how we can represent this symbolically.

15
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:52,567
The first thing I want you to think about is:

16
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:56,833
Can we set up an equation

17
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:01,813
that expresses these 3 things of mass 'X'

18
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:05,900
and that in total their mass is equal to
the total mass over here.

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,698
Can we express that as an equation?

20
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:08,952
I will give you a few seconds to do it...

21
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:11,367
[silence]

22
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:14,432
Let's think about it.
Over here, we have 3 thing with mass 'X'

23
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:22,087
so their total mass we could write as
X + X + X

24
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:26,414
And over here, we have nine things 
with a mass of one kilogram,

25
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:39,620
which we could write as
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,296
And actually, this is a mathematical representation

27
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:45,036
We set it up as an equation, so
it is an algebraic representation.

28
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:48,220
It is not the simplest possible way to do it, 
but it is reasonable.

29
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,835
I we want, we could say: "If have an X plus another X plus another X, I have 3 X's."

30
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:59,479
So I could re-write this as 3X
and 3X will be equal to...

31
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,819
--If I sum up all these ones over here,
we have 9 of them,

32
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:07,220
So I have 3X = 9.

33
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,832
Let me make sure that is right
[counts to 9]

34
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,554
So that is how we would set up.

35
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:17,287
The next question is: 
What could we do mathematically

36
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:21,213
to either one of these equations
(but we will focus on this one)

37
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:25,954
What could we do mathematically
in order to solve for the X

38
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:29,572
Or to figure out what that mystery mass actually is?

39
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:31,420
I will give you another second or two to think about it.

40
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,754
[silence]

41
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,584
When we did it the last time, with the scales,

42
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:40,354
we said "We have 3 of these X's here.
We want to have just 1 X here,"

43
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:43,887
So we could say "whatever this X is, 
if the scales stay balanced,

44
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:46,244
It will be the same as what we have there."

45
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:50,220
There might be a temptation to subtract 2 of the X's from this side,

46
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,287
but that will not help us,
we can even see that mathematically over here,

47
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:55,578
if we subtracted 2 X's from both sides,

48
00:02:55,578 --> 00:03:01,554
on the left-hand side we would have 3x - 2x,
and on the right you would have 9 - 2x

49
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,241
And you would be left with:

50
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:05,888
3 of something minus 2 of something is 1 of something

51
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:08,906
so you would have 1x there, if you get rid of 2 of them,

52
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:11,832
but on the right-hand side, you will get
9 minus 2 X's.

53
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:15,554
So the X's still don't help you out,
you still have this mystery mass on the right-hand side.

54
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:19,754
That doesn't help, so instead what we say is 
- and we did this the last time -

55
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:22,560
We said "what if we took a third of these things?"

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,835
If we take 1/3 of these things 
and we take 1/3 of those things,

57
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:29,897
we should still get the same mass on both sides
because the original things had the same mass.

58
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:32,220
The equivalent of doing this mathematically 
is to say

59
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,563
"Why don't we multiply both sides by one-third?"

60
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:38,164
Or another way to say it is
"we can divide both sides by three"

61
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:41,739
Multiplying by 1/3 is the same thing as dividing by 3.

62
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,572
So we multiply both sides by one-third.

63
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:48,420
When you multiply by one-third, visually, 
over here, if you had 3 X's

64
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,354
and you multiplied by 1/3,
you would have only one X left.

65
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:59,247
If you have 9 of these 1 kg boxes, and you multiply by 1/3, you will have 3 left.

66
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:04,487
Over here you can even visually divide by 3
- which is the same as multiplying by 1/3 -

67
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:15,408
-- so you divide by 3 -
you have an X is equal to 1 + 1 + 1. X = 3.

68
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:18,620
Or you see here that X = 3.

69
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,887
Over here you do the math:
1/3 * 3 = 1 and you're left with one X

70
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:29,898
so you are left with
X = 9 * 1/3, or you can do 9 divided by 3,

71
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:36,687
which is equal to 3.
