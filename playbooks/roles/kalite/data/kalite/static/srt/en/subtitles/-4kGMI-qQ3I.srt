1
00:00:01,973 --> 00:00:06,469
If you take a good long listen to your heart, 
you actually notice that it makes sounds.

2
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:11,625
Those sounds are usually described as lubdub, lubdub, lubdub.

3
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:18,971
If you ever tried to figure out what that would spell out like,
usually it's something like lubdub.

4
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:21,074
This repeats over and over and over.

5
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:26,636
To figure out where those sounds come from, what I did is, I took the diagram of the heart that we'v been using

6
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:31,748
and exaggerated the valves, 
made them really clear to see in this picture.

7
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:36,868
We'll use those valves to talk through where those sounds are coming from.

8
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:42,616
Let's start by labeling our heart, 
at the top, blood is coming into the right atrium,

9
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:46,078
going to the right ventricle,
it goes off to the lungs,

10
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:50,046
comes back into the left atrium
and then the left ventricle.

11
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:53,569
These are the chambers of our heart.

12
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:58,136
Keep your eye on the valves 
and we'll talk about them as the blood moves through.

13
00:00:58,136 --> 00:01:03,678
Let's start with blood going from the right atrium,
this way into the right ventricle.

14
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:08,305
At the same moment blood is going from the right atrium to the right ventricle,

15
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:12,073
blood is actually also going from the left atrium to the left ventricle.

16
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:16,702
You might think 'How's that possible? 
How can blood be in two places at one time?'

17
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,673
But now remember that blood is constantly moving through the heart,

18
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:26,201
so in a previous cycle you actually had some blood that's coming back from the lungs

19
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:28,536
and that's what's dumping into the left ventricle.

20
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:33,971
In the new cycle you have a bit of blood that's going from the right atrium to the right ventricle.

21
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:41,337
You have simultaneously two chambers that are full of blood, the right and left ventricle.

22
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:45,668
To get the blood into those ventricles, the valves had to open.

23
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:58,925
Let's label all the valves.
Here you have our tricuspid valve. And I'm gonna label it just as 'T'

24
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:06,679
Up here you have the pulmonary valve.

25
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:14,923
On the other side you have the mitral valve, 
which separates the left atrium from the left ventricle.

26
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:18,872
Here you've got the aortic valve.

27
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,089
These are the four valves of the heart.

28
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:29,343
As the blood is now in the ventricles,
you can see that the tricuspid and the mitral valve are open. So far so good

29
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:35,441
I've drawn the pulmonary valve as being open, 
but is that really the case?

30
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:41,770
The answer is no, because what happens is that as blood is moving down from the atrium to the right ventricle,

31
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:48,105
let's say that, and I'm gonna draw it in black, black arrows represent the wrong direction of flow,

32
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:54,134
let's say some blood is trying to go that way,
which is not the way it should be going,

33
00:02:54,134 --> 00:03:04,666
what happens is, these two valves, based on their shape,
they're gonna jam up like this.

34
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:08,204
They're not gonna let blood pass through.

35
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:11,270
This is what happens, that valve closes down.

36
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:19,072
The same thing happens on this side.
Imagine you have some backwards flow blood by accident. That means that's going the wrong direction.

37
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:22,501
Then these valves are going to close down.

38
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:29,168
The white arrows represent the correct flow of the blood 
and the black arrows represent the incorrect flow of the blood.

39
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,706
These valves shut down like that.

40
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:39,973
You can see how the pulmonary and aortic valve are closed
when the mitral and tricuspid valve are open.

41
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:41,669
What happens after this?

42
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,570
The ventricles are full of blood and let's say they squeeze.

43
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:55,936
They squeeze down and they jettison all the blood into those arteries.

44
00:03:55,936 --> 00:04:03,635
This is going to close down.
This arrow flips around.

45
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:09,973
These arrows become white because the flow is gonna be in the direction we want it.

46
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,585
It's gonna go this way and this way.

47
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:18,207
And to allow that, I need to show you, these open up.

48
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:22,418
They allow the blood to go the way we want it to go.

49
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:26,507
Now, blood is gonna flow through those two valves.

50
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:31,588
Similar to before, you could have some back flow here, right?

51
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:35,042
You can have back flow here 
and you can have back flow here.

52
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:41,736
You can imagine, let's say you have a little back flow that wants to go this way, which is the wrong direction,

53
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:45,088
then these valves are gonna close up.

54
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:49,433
They'll say 'No, you can't go that way.'
They're gonna close up.

55
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:54,248
They won't allow blood to go that way.

56
00:04:54,248 --> 00:05:00,374
This is gonna happen on both sides, both ventricles and the valves shut.

57
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:06,406
So basically the back flow of blood is not allowed 
because the valves keep shutting.

58
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:15,019
When the valves snap shut, 
for example the tricuspid and the mitral valve snap shut,

59
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,795
well, that makes a noise.

60
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:25,576
When T and M snap shut, 
that makes a noise that we call lub.

61
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:29,134
That's that first noise, that first heart sound.

62
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:38,239
In fact sometimes people don't even call it lubdub,
they say, well, it's the first heart sound.

63
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:42,999
To make that even shorter, sometimes people call that S1.

64
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:46,586
If you hear S1, 
you know they're talking about that same exact thing.

65
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:52,499
This dub is called the second heart sound.

66
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:57,660
No surprise, just as before, if that's S1, this is S2.

67
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:06,495
You'll hear S1 when the tricuspid and the mitral valve snap shut. So far so good.

68
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,832
But you also know that if that is what's making the noise,

69
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:21,573
you can kind of guess, and it's a smart guess that at the same time the pulmonic and the aortic valve just opened.

70
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:25,469
If the other valves snap shut, these just opened.

71
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:31,575
You can kind of assume that, 
although the noise you're hearing is actually from here.

72
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:34,635
What's happening with dub?
Well, the opposite.

73
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:39,302
What I mean by that is, 
let me show you what happens a moment later.

74
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:50,333
After the ventricles are done squeezing, then we get to a point where you might have a little bit of flow that way and that way.

75
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:56,199
Just as I drew before and these valves snap shut as well.

76
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,330
So now these snap shut.

77
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:08,297
As these snap shut because they don't want to allow back flow, they make noise.

78
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:20,744
So when you have dub, you have noise coming from the pulmonic and the aortic valve snapping shut.

79
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:24,196
That must mean that the other two valves just opened up.

80
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:27,864
The tricuspid and mitral valve just opened.
You can assume that, right?

81
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:34,265
I didn't draw that in the picture,
let me update my picture now to show that.

82
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:43,640
These two have opened up 
and blood is coming into the ventricles.

83
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,740
It's actually a nice little rhythm that you get going.

84
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,002
Every time these valves go open and shut,
you hear noise.

85
00:07:56,002 --> 00:08:07,655
You can figure out what's happening.

86
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,601
We've returned to where we started from.

87
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:17,531
You basically have a full cycle and between these two, 
let's say from lub to dub,

88
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:21,470
there's a little bit of space there,
if you were to follow it over time.

89
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,200
Over time this is what it might look like 
if this is a little timeline.

90
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:36,643
You might hear lub here, our first heart sound, 
let's call it S1 here, S2 here, the second heart sound.

91
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:41,536
You'll hear S1 again over here and S2.

92
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:51,105
What's happening between these two, time like here,
is that blood is actually squeezing out

93
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:57,415
because the pulmonic and aortic valves just opened, 
blood is squeezing out and going to the whole body.

94
00:08:57,415 --> 00:09:05,767
This is when blood is going to the body.So we call it 'Systole'.

95
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:20,401
Between dub and the next lub, so in this area,
at that point, blood is refilling from the atria to the ventricles

96
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:24,123
and we call that diastole.

97
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:31,360
Now you can listen to your heart and figure out, 
well if you listen to the sound between lub and dub,

98
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,317
the space in time between lub and dub,
that's when you're having systole.

99
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:49,546
If you're waiting for the sound to start up again, you just heard dub and are waiting for lub again, 
that space in time is diastole.
