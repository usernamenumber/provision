1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,830
Find the difference.

3
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,290
Express the answer as a
simplified rational

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,890
expression, and state
the domain.

5
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,930
We have two rational
expressions, and we're

6
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,710
subtracting one from
the other.

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,910
Just like when we first learned
to subtract fractions,

8
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,200
or add fractions, we have to
find a common denominator.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,080
The best way to find a common
denominator, if were just

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,330
dealing with regular numbers, or
with algebraic expressions,

11
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,780
is to factor them out, and
make sure that our common

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,515
denominator has all of the
factors in it-- that'll ensure

13
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:30,970
that it's divisible by the
two denominators here.

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,759
This guy right here is
completely factored-- he's

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,250
just a plus 2.

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,610
This one over here, let's see if
we can factor it: a squared

17
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,440
plus 4a plus 4.

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,070
Well, you see the pattern that
4 is 2 squared, 4 is 2 times

19
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,890
2, so a squared plus 4a plus 4
is a plus 2 times a plus 2, or

20
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,790
a plus 2 squared.

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,870
We could say it's a plus 2 times
a plus 2-- that's what a

22
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,560
squared plus 4a plus 4 is.

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,990
This is obviously divisible
by itself-- everything is

24
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,280
divisible by itself, except, I
guess, for 0, is divisible by

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,040
itself, and it's also divisible
by a plus 2, so this

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,210
is the least common multiple of
this expression, and that

27
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,480
expression, and it could be
a good common denominator.

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,070
Let's set that up.

29
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,530
This will be the same thing as
being equal to this first term

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,480
right here, a minus 2 over
a plus 2, but we want the

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,935
denominator now to be a plus 2
times a plus 2-- we wanted it

32
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:31,620
to be a plus 2 squared.

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,530
So, let's multiply this
numerator and denominator by a

34
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,510
plus 2, so its denominator is
the same thing as this.

35
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,450
Let's multiply both the
numerator and the denominator

36
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,750
by a plus 2.

37
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,445
We're going to assume that a
is not equal to negative 2,

38
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:48,270
that would have made this
undefined, and it would have

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,970
also made this undefined.

40
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,950
Throughout this whole thing,
we're going to assume that a

41
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,800
cannot be equal to negative 2.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,360
The domain is all real numbers,
a can be any real

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,120
number except for negative 2.

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,780
So, the first term is that--
extend the line a little bit--

45
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,390
and then the second term doesn't
change, because its

46
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,340
denominator is already the
common denominator.

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,230
Minus a minus 3 over-- and we
could write it either as a

48
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,660
plus 2 times a plus 2, or
as this thing over here.

49
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,040
Let's write it in the factored
form, because it'll make it

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,820
easier to simplify later on:
a plus 2 times a plus 2.

51
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,400
And now, before we-- let's set
this up like this-- now,

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,890
before we add the numerators,
it'll probably be a good idea

53
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,410
to multiply this out right
there, but let me write the

54
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,050
denominator, we know what
that is: it is a plus 2

55
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,240
times a plus 2.

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,890
Now this numerator: if we have
a minus 2 times a plus 2,

57
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,000
we've seen that pattern
before.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,540
We can multiply it out if you
like, but we've seen it enough

59
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,960
hopefully to recognize that this
is going to be a squared

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,370
minus 2 squared.

61
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,880
This is going to be
a squared minus 4.

62
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,250
You can multiply it out, and the
middle terms cancel out--

63
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,850
the negative 2 times a cancels
out the a times 2, and you're

64
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,230
just left with a squared minus
4-- that's that over there.

65
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,330
And then you have this: you have
minus a minus 3, so let's

66
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,440
be very careful here-- you're
subtracting a minus 3, so you

67
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,630
want to distribute the negative
sign, or multiply

68
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,860
both of these terms
times negative 1.

69
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,760
So you could put a minus a here,
and then negative 3 is

70
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,530
plus 3, so what does
this simplify to?

71
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:33,050
You have a squared minus a
plus-- let's see, negative 4

72
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:42,220
plus 3 is negative 1, all
of that over a plus 2

73
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,080
times a plus 2.

74
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,285
We could write that as
a plus 2 squared.

75
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:49,800
   

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,230
Now, we might want to factor
this numerator out more, to

77
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,760
just make sure it doesn't
contain a common factor with

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,450
the denominator.

79
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,200
The denominator is just 2a
plus 2 is multiplied by

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
themselves.

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,230
And you can see from inspection
a plus 2 will not

82
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,600
be a factor in this top
expression-- if it was, this

83
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,490
number right here would be
divisible by 2, it's not

84
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,260
divisible by 2.

85
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,780
So, a plus 2 is not one of the
factors here, so there's not

86
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,910
going to be any more
simplification, even if we

87
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,019
were able to factor this thing,
and the numerator out.

88
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,250
So

89
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,010
we're done.

90
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,720
We have simplified the rational
expression, and the

91
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,960
domain is for all a's, except
for a cannot, or, all a's

92
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,950
given that a does not equal
negative 2-- all a's except

93
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,330
for negative 2.

94
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,210
And we are done.
