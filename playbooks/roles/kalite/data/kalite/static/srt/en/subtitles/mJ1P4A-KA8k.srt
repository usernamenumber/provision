1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,930
Write 6 times 6 times 6 times
6 times 6 times 6 times 6

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,640
times 6 in exponential, in exponential
notation.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,260
So what's going on over here?

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,590
Well, we have 6 multiplied
by itself how many times?

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,030
Let's see, that's 6 times 1,
then 6 times 2 is that.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,330
That's 6 times-- well,
it's not 6 times 2.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,490
It's 6 times itself two times.

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,150
Remember, 6 times itself
two times would be 36.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,360
6 times 2 would only be 12.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,720
So we have one 6, two 6, three
6, four 6, five 6's, six 6's,

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,240
seven 6's, eight 6's.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,470
So we're multiplying 6 by
itself eight times.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,380
To write this in exponential
notation, we would say that

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:55,180
this is equal to 6, this is equal to 6 to the
eighth power, which is

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,550
literally equal to 6 times 6
times 6 times 6 times 6 times

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,220
6 times 6 times 6.

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,670
Now, I want to make it very
clear this is NOT, this is

18
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:13,110
NOT, this is NOT equal to 6 times 8, 6 times 8

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,930
6 times 8 will only be 48.

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,680
6 to the eighth power is
a super huge number.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,580
6 times 6 is 36, and you're
going to multiply that times

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,880
6, which is what?

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,360
That's like 36 times--
that's what?

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,370
216, and you keep multiplying
it by 6, you get some huge

25
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:31,990
number here.

26
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,690
This number right here.

27
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,120
It's worthwhile to point out
this number is huge.

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,320
This number is huge. This number is huge

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,870
This number right here,
not so huge.

30
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,250
It is not huge.

31
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,320
So don't get confused.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,310
If you see 6 to the eighth
power, it's 6 times itself

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,110
eight times, not 6 times 8.
