1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,820
Problem number 32.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:05,010
A scale drawing of a horse is shown below.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,040
That's the horse.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,470
I'm probably not helping you much at this point.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,620
What is the actual height of the horse in inches,

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,050
from the hoof to the top of the head?

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,260
Well, they made a little scale for us.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,000
This distance right here is 8 inches.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,770
And then they measure this scale multiple times.

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,570
So how many times are we going this distance?

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:32,020
We go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,610
So the horse is 9 times this distance,

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,760
which is 8 inches.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,550
Which is equal to 72 inches.

15
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,010
So that's how tall the horse is in reality.

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,740
Which is what? It's like 6 feet tall.

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,050
33.

18
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,620
A shipping company has 25 offices

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,000
that shipped 60,000 packages last week.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,490
The offices were open 6 days

21
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,490
and used 80,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity.

22
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,470
Which pieces of information given above are necessary to

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,540
find the average number of packages shipped

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,050
per day last week?

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,260
So let's think about it.

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,000
They didn't ask us anything about electricity.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,080
So we definitely don't need that information.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,910
And they're saying the average number of packages shipped

29
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,040
per day last week.

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,190
They're not saying per day per office last week.

31
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,020
So we don't need to know how many offices.

32
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,350
We just need to know that 60,000 packages

33
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,110
were shipped last week,

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,570
and the offices were open 6 days.

35
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,640
So they operated for 6 days.

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,880
So we could figure out the answer.

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,390
The answer is obviously 10,000.

38
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,120
But they're not asking us that.

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,010
They're asking us, what information do we need?

40
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,000
We need the total number of packages shipped last week,

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,460
and we need the number of days that the office was open.

42
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,540
So what choices are that?

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,510
The number of offices--

44
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,970
no, we don't need the number of offices,

45
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,020
because they didn't ask us per office.

46
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,000
The number of packages and the amount of electricity?

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,540
No. This has nothing to do with electricity.

48
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,020
The number of packages and the number of days

49
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,000
open during the week?

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,980
Yeah, that's what we used.

51
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,630
The number of packages and the number of days

52
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,050
open during the week.

53
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,660
The number of days open during the week

54
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,400
and the amount of electricity?

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,610
No, this had nothing to do with the electricity.

56
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,030
So our choice is C.

57
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,050
Problem 34.

58
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,400
A landscaper estimates that landscaping a new park

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,020
will take 1 person 48 hours.

60
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,280
If 4 people work on the job,

61
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,780
and they each work 6-hour days,

62
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,040
how many days are needed to complete the job?

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,880
If 1 person takes 48 hours,

64
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,060
4 people are going to take 1/4 as long.

65
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:55,000
So 48 divided by 4 is going to be equal to 12 hours.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,280
If 4 people are each working 12 hours,

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,080
that's the same thing as 1 person working 48 hours,

68
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,640
assuming that you could divide the job up in that way.

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,020
So these 4 people are going to take 12 hours,

70
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,900
all working simultaneously,

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,050
and they each worked 6-hour days.

72
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,630
So they're going to work a total of 12 hours,

73
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,300
because there's 4 of them,

74
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,490
so they can take 1/4 of the time,

75
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,440
but they can only do 6 hours per day.

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,000
So it's going to take them 2 days to work their 12 hours.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,050
It's going to take 2 days to complete the job.

78
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,800
And that's all we have on that page.
