1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,530
Let's do another stoichiometry
problem where the reaction is

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,570
occurring inside
of a solution.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,550
So we have a metallic zinc and
it reacts with aqueous

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,660
hydrochloric acid.

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,270
We see that right there, the
metallic zinc. And then the

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,980
hydrochloric acid is
dissolved in water,

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,230
it's an aqueous solution.

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,140
The solvent is water.

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,310
Makes these products
right there.

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,380
And they say, what volume of
0.25 molar-- so they're giving

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,880
us the concentration
of the solution.

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,640
What volume of 0.25 molar
hydrochloric acid in

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,190
milliliters-- so we've got to
remember that, they want their

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,850
answer in milliliters-- is
required to convert 11.8 grams

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,910
of zinc completely
to products?

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,880
So the way we can do this
we'll figure out.

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
We know that we're
starting off with

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,150
11.8 grams right there.

20
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,880
And we just have to figure out
well, if we have 11.8 grams of

21
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,950
zinc, how many moles
of zinc that is.

22
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,000
And then, assuming this is a
balanced equation-- and I'm

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,670
going to verify that right after
I finish this sentence--

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,920
but assuming that this is a
balanced equation, for every

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,170
mole of zinc we're going
to need two moles of

26
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,350
hydrochloric acid.

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,480
And then we can figure out
given how many moles of

28
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,680
hydrochloric acid we need, then
how much of the solution

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,870
do we need based on
its concentration?

30
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,690
So let's do that.

31
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,440
It's going to, I think,
be a lot simpler when

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,350
we actually do it.

33
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,540
But I just want to give you
the action plan before we

34
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,280
break into it.

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,520
But before we do anything,
let's verify that this is

36
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,510
really a balanced equation.

37
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,270
So you have 1 zinc on the
left-hand side, 1 zinc on the

38
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,630
right-hand side, 2 hydrogens
on the left, 2 hydrogens on

39
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,810
the right, 2 chlorines
on the left, 2

40
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,140
chlorines on the right.

41
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,200
So it looks balanced.

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,490
Let's do the problem.

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,220
So the first thing we want to
do-- we're starting off with

44
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:56,865
11.8 grams of zinc, they give
us that information.

45
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:58,650
Now we're going to figure
out how many moles

46
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,790
of zinc that is.

47
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,215
We're going to want to convert
this to moles.

48
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:10,479
So it's going to be moles
of zinc over grams of

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,880
zinc moles per gram.

50
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,390
And if you look it up on a
periodic table, zinc has an

51
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,700
atomic weight of 65.38, so
its molar mass is 65.38.

52
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:29,100
So it's 1 mole for every 65.38
grams, or its 1/65, roughly,

53
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,260
of a mole per gram.

54
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,700
   

55
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,180
Actually, you know what?

56
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,520
I'm just going to save our
calculator for the end.

57
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,970
So the grams of zinc cancels
that with the grams of zinc,

58
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:52,600
and we're left with 11.8 divided
by 65.38 moles of

59
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,360
zinc.

60
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,880
Now we're trying to figure out
how much of this solution of

61
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,200
hydrochloric acid is required.

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,260
So the next thing we want to
figure out is how many moles

63
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,000
of hydrochloric acid
are required.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,450
And we see that for every mole
of zinc we need 2 moles of the

65
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,830
hydrochloric acid.

66
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,820
Let me write it this way.

67
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,670
For every 1 mole of zinc--
we'll put that in the

68
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,300
denominator.

69
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,690
I'll switch colors just
arbitrarily here-- we need 2

70
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,510
moles of hydrochloric acid.

71
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,920
That is required.

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,720
And so then we can multiply
the moles of zinc. We'll

73
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,760
cancel out the moles of zinc.
That's why I wrote

74
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,530
2/1 instead of 1/2.

75
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,410
Two moles of hydrochloric acid
for every mole of zinc. And

76
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,240
what does this give us?

77
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,340
This gives us-- I'm not even
going to do the math.

78
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:55,620
It's 11.8 times 2 over 65.38.

79
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,480
And then we're left with moles
of hydrochloric acid

80
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,060
required-- moles
of hydrochloric

81
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,230
acid-- HCl-- required.

82
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,820
So we haven't solved
the problem yet.

83
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,530
We want to figure out
what volume of

84
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,720
the solution we need.

85
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,550
We know the actual number of
molecules we need, but we need

86
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,170
to know how much solution
will contain

87
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,519
that number of molecules.

88
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,995
So we want to express
this in liters.

89
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,570
Well, eventually we're going
to get to milliliters, but

90
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,310
let's just go straight to liters
first because molarity

91
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,580
is always expressed in liters.

92
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,070
So let's multiply this.

93
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,155
We want the moles of
HCl to cancel out.

94
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:40,070
So let's put that in the
denominator, moles of

95
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,290
hydrochloric acid.

96
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:48,895
And we want liters of
hydrochloric acid, let me put

97
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:53,900
it this way, liters
of 2.50 molar

98
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,950
hydrochloric acid solution.

99
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,430
When anyone puts this big M
there, that's molarity.

100
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,720
You assume they're talking
about a solution because

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,740
they're giving you the
concentration of the solute in

102
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,700
the total solution.

103
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,740
So how many moles are
there per liter?

104
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,260
Well this concentration
is telling us.

105
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,610
Molarity is moles per liter.

106
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:22,810
So there are 2.50 moles for
every 1 liter of our solution.

107
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,720
That's what that tells us.

108
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,050
This is a 2.5 molar solution.

109
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,400
Its molarity is 2.5.

110
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,870
There are 2.52 moles
for every liter.

111
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,030
And I wrote the moles in the
denominator because I wanted

112
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,900
to cancel out here.

113
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,020
So it's 1/2.5.

114
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,280
So let's cancel those
two guys out.

115
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,120
That cancels out with
that right there.

116
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,470
And then we are left with 11.8
times 2 in the numerator.

117
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,910
   

118
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:59,890
And in the denominator, we have
65.38 times 2-- let me

119
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,120
write the times not as
a-- I'll write it

120
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,690
that way-- times 2.50.

121
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:13,870
And all we're left with in our
units is liters of 2.50 molar

122
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:20,010
HCl solution-- and then in
that green-- required.

123
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,060
We're almost done.

124
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,620
Then we can get break out
the calculator and

125
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,320
get the exact answer.

126
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,280
They want the answer
in milliliters.

127
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,180
So far we have the
answer in liters.

128
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,810
I mean, there's going to be some
number here, I don't know

129
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,480
what it is.

130
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,960
But it's that number of liters
of the 2.5 molar hydrochloric

131
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,370
acid solution is required.

132
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,275
Let me just copy
and paste this.

133
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:46,280
Let's convert this to
milliliters because that's

134
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,530
what they want.

135
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,690
   

136
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,930
So that's what we had from
the previous line.

137
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,110
And to convert this to
milliliters-- we've done this

138
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:01,440
drill before-- we want the
liters to cancel out.

139
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,690
I'll just do it like this.

140
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,030
   

141
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,870
And we want our answer
in milliliters.

142
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,050
And how many milliliters
are there for a liter?

143
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,850
Well there are 1,000 milliliters
per 1 liter.

144
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,910
And all of these steps-- the way
I'm showing it to you, I'm

145
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,270
making the dimensions
cancel out.

146
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,080
But hopefully, they're making
some intuitive sense as well,

147
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,360
that we divide by 2.5 at this
stage because we have more

148
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,010
than 1 mole per liter.

149
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,090
So however many moles we
require, we're going to have

150
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,700
fewer liters required.

151
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,930
So we're going to be dividing
by a number that's

152
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,890
greater than 1.

153
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,560
If that doesn't make sense to
you, just stick to the units.

154
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,350
But at every one of these steps
I really want you to

155
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,770
actually conceptualize
the numbers as well.

156
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,560
But let's go back
to the problem.

157
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,330
So we're converting
it to milliliters.

158
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,860
So our final solution we're left
with, we have the liters.

159
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,420
Cancelling out the liters, and
so we're left with, in the

160
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:11,460
numerator, 11.8 times 2 times
1,000 over 65.38 times 2.50.

161
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,880
And in the numerator we're left
with milliliters of 2.5

162
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,920
molar hydrochloric acid.

163
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,310
   

164
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,760
I'll just write it milliliters
of 2.50 molar

165
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,980
hydrochloric acid.

166
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,380
I don't want this 2.50 molar
HCl to confuse you.

167
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,960
These aren't numbers in the
computation, this is a label

168
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,760
to say what type of solution.

169
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,840
We could have just written
over here liters of the

170
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,370
solution in question.

171
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,250
In case these numbers confuse
you, we could have written

172
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,893
liters of the solution.

173
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:47,960
   

174
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,060
And then this would be
milliliters of the solution.

175
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,900
I don't want that 2.5
to confuse you.

176
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,090
That's just the name of
the solution, or its

177
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,800
concentration.

178
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,390
That's how we're
identifying it.

179
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,620
But now we've solved
the problem.

180
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,020
We just need to calculate this
number, so let's break out the

181
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,270
calculator.

182
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,630
   

183
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:17,520
And you get 11.8 times 2 times
1,000 divided by 65.38.

184
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,050
And we're also going
to divide by 2.5.

185
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,210
It's in the denominator,
it's 144.

186
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,080
And actually our lowest-- let's
see, a couple of numbers

187
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,525
here only have three significant
digits, so we

188
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,210
should really only stick to
three significant digits, so

189
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,450
it's 144 milliliters.

190
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,570
So this right here is 144
milliliters of, we could say

191
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,490
the solution, or of
the 2.5 molar

192
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,070
hydrochloric acid solution.

193
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,930
And we're done.

194
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,060
Hopefully you found that fun.

195
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,200
