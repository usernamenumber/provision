1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,480
We're asked to factor 20u
squared v minus 10uv squared.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,630
And when they say factor a
binomial like this, an

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,470
expression that has two terms
like this, they really mean

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,450
break it up into the product of
one or more terms. So let's

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,210
see if we can do that.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,500
And the easiest way we can do
that, is say hey, is there any

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,270
common factor?

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,320
In particular, let's find the
greatest common factor of each

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,610
of these terms and then
divide that out.

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,800
Or you can almost imagine,
un-distribute it out, and I'll

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,190
show you what I'm talking
about in a second.

13
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,815
And eventually you'll be able
to do this in your head, but

14
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:33,790
we'll work through it step
by step right now.

15
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,970
So what is 20u squared v
if we factor it out?

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,020
20u squared v, if we do into the
prime factorization, it is

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,000
20 is 2 times 2 times 5.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,360
Right?

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,660
That's 2 times 10, that's 20.

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,560
u squared is times u times u
and then v is just one v.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,150
So we just rewrote 20u squared
v into kind of a product of

22
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,310
its smallest components, its
most fundamental components,

23
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,980
prime numbers and just
u's and v's.

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,620
Now let's do the same exact
thing for the 10uv squared.

25
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,520
So we'll put that minus sign
there so that we haven't

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,440
fundamentally changed
the expression.

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,250
10 is, if we break it down to
its prime factors, 2 times 5.

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,890
Then we have one u times
one u times v times v.

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,570
That's what v squared
is, times v times v.

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,560
Now what's the greatest common
factor of these two terms

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,490
right here?

32
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,490
Well let's see.

33
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,920
They both have one 2.

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,090
They both have one
2 right there.

35
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,880
Maybe I'll circle that one, I
could have circled that one.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,380
They both have one 5--
that's one 5, one 5.

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,380
They both have one u, one
u there, one u there.

38
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,600
This one has two, but only this
one has one, and they

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,950
both have at least one v.

40
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,770
   

41
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,610
So the greatest common factor is
2 times 5 times u times v.

42
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,860
So I could rewrite this
expression, I can kind of

43
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,520
un-distribute the 2 times
5 times u times v,

44
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,660
and what'll we get?

45
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:10,210
If we wrote 2 times 5 times u
times v, and we say that's

46
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,750
going to be-- this expression
is equal to this times what?

47
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,250
Well if you factor the 2 times
5 times u times v out, all

48
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,090
you're going to be left with
in this first term is the 2

49
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,060
times u, so 2u here.

50
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,030
And in the second term,
all you're going to be

51
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,650
left with is a v.

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:29,910
Right?

53
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,460
All this other stuff
gets factored out.

54
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,520
All you're going to be
left with is a v.

55
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,050
Hopefully you see, if I multiply
2 times 5 times u

56
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,460
times v times 2u, I'm going to
get this first term here.

57
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,220
So if I were to distribute it,
I would get this first term.

58
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,150
And if I multiply 2 times 5
times u times v times this v

59
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,350
over here, I'm going to
get this second term.

60
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,860
So this expression, and
that expression is

61
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,400
the exact same thing.

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,850
We have factored it
out, now we can

63
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,180
simplify it a little bit.

64
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,510
2 times 5 times u times
v we rewrite as 10uv.

65
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,530
And then inside the parentheses,
we of course have

66
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,470
a 2u and then a minus v.

67
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,090
And we're done!

68
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,970
We have factored
the expression.

69
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,240
Now you won't be doing it to
this granular level, but this

70
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,850
is the best way to
think about it.

71
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,230
Eventually you're going to
say, hey, wait, look, the

72
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,360
largest number that divides
both of these is a 10.

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,690
Because you could see 10 goes
into the 20, 10 goes into 10.

74
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,120
And, let's see, a u goes into
both of these, and a v goes

75
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,740
into both of these.

76
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,510
So let me factor out a 10uv,
and then if I divide this

77
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,390
thing by 10uv, I'm going
to be left with 2u.

78
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,330
And if I divide this by 10uv,
I'm going to just

79
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,020
be left with a v.

80
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,360
So that's another way
to think about it.

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,390
Let me do that right now, so we
could say that this is the

82
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,730
same thing.

83
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,030
Another way of approaching it,
you could have said that this

84
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,280
is the same thing as-- Well,
the largest number that

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,650
divides both of these is 10uv,
and that's going to be times

86
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:06,370
20u squared v over 10uv
minus this thing.

87
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,300
10uv squared over 10uv.

88
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,910
This expression and this are
obviously the same thing.

89
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,480
If I were to distribute the 10uv
it would cancel out with

90
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,490
each of these in the denominator
right there.

91
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,110
So they're the same thing,
but we can do is we

92
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,329
can simplify this.

93
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,740
We could say that 20 divided
by 10 is just 2, u squared

94
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,570
divided by u is just a u, v
divided by v is just 1, 10

95
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,280
divided by 10 is 1, u divide by
u is u, v squared divided

96
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,900
by v is just a v to
the first power.

97
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,620
So you're left with 10uv times
the quantity 2u minus v.

98
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,180
Either way you get
the same answer.

99
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,533
