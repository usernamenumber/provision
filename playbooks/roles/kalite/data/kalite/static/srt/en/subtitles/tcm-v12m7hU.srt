1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,460
Problem 110.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,080
If candy bars that regularly sell for $0.40 each are on

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,010
sale at 2 for $0.75-- so they used to be $0.40, and now

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:17,610
they're going 2 for $0.75-- what is the percent reduction in

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,640
the price of 2 such candy bars purchased at the sale price?

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,010
What is the price reduction?

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,640
So before, if I was going to buy 2 candy bars,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,210
I'd be paying $0.80,and now for 2 candy bars I'm paying $0.75

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,020
So I'm saving $0.05 or I'm getting a $0.05 price reduction.

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,210
So they want to know the percent price reduction.

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,070
So it's essentially what percent is $0.05 of $0.80?

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,420
5 over 80 is equal to what percentage?

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,500
So let's just figure it out.

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,930
80 goes into 5-- and actually, we could divide the top and

15
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,090
the bottom, make it a little bit easier.

16
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,010
5.00, add some 0's there. So 80 does not go into 50.

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,620
80 goes into 500, so how many times does 8--

18
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,730
It goes into it six times, because 8 times 6 is 48.

19
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:22,670
6 times 80 is 480. 500 minus 480 is 200.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,020
80 goes into 200 two times.

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,070
2 times 80 is 160, and then remainder of 400.

22
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,010
800 goes into 400 five times.

23
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:40,020
So that's 0.0625, which is the same thing as 6.25%.

24
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:47,050
And that is choice B, 6 1/4%. Same thing. Choice B.

25
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,530
Problem 111.

26
00:01:52,630 --> 00:02:01,980
If s is greater than 0, and the square root of r over s is

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,630
equal to s, what is r in terms of s?

28
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,270
OK, so let's just square both sides of this equation,

29
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,760
so you get r over s.

30
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,140
The square root of r over s squared is just r over s.

31
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,840
And that's going to be equal to s squared.

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,480
We've got to square both sides of the equation.

33
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,290
Now let's multiply both sides of the equation times s,

34
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,330
and we get r is equal to s to the third.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,100
r is equal to s to the third,either way.And that is choice D.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,720
Next question, 112.

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,570
They've drawn us a neat little diagram here.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,020
Let me see if I can draw what they have drawn.

39
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,120
They drew it in a dark color, so I'll draw it--

40
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,690
That's kind of overly bright, but it gets the job done.

41
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,430
And then they have two boxes inside of it.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,010
It looks like that. One box, something like that.

43
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,490
One box, and then there's another box in there.

44
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,540
It looks something like that,

45
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,050
although they look like the same size in the picture.

46
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:32,040
And they tell us that this distance is 6 feet.

47
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,020
They tell us that this distance is 8 feet.

48
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,730
The front of a 6 by 8 foot rectangular door has brass

49
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,900
rectangular trim, as indicated by the shading

50
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,370
in the figure above. OK, this green stuff is brass.

51
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,250
If the trim is uniformly 1 foot wide-- so that's 1 foot--

52
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,450
what fraction of the door's front surface is covered by trim?

53
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,040
So we need to figure out the area that is essentially green.

54
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, the easier thing might be to figure out the area

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,680
that's black, and then subtract it from the total area.

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,010
So what's the area that's black?

57
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,090
So both of these-- well, they don't tell us.

58
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,140
Well, it doesn't matter, we could figure it out.

59
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,950
Well, there's a couple of ways to figure it out.

60
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,010
Let's just figure out the area that's green.

61
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,060
I'm going to do it in different color.

62
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,340
So let's figure out this area right here.

63
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,010
I hope you can see that. So that area is what?

64
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,460
Let me actually draw all of the different boxes and then

65
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,700
we can figure out the areas.

66
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:41,040
Then we have that one. And then we have this one.

67
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,550
And then we have this one right here.

68
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,630
What's the area of this?

69
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,430
Its height is 8, this is 8, and its width is 1.

70
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,980
So the area here is 8, and so the area here is going to be 8

71
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,210
of this box right here, that whole box.

72
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,890
What's the width of this?

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,670
Well, it's not the whole 6,because you have 1 here and 1 here

74
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,270
So the width is going to be 4 by 1,

75
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,040
so this is going to have an area of 4.

76
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,040
This is the same thing, width of 4 by 1, and that's 4 and 4.

77
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,380
So all of the green stuff has an area of-- 4 plus 4,

78
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:29,080
plus 4-- that's 12-- plus 8, plus 8, plus 16, is equal to 28.

79
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,310
They want to know what fraction of the door's front

80
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,720
surface is covered by the trim.

81
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,010
So 28 is the amount of square feet covered by the trim.

82
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,080
And what's the total surface area of the front?

83
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,310
The total area's going to be 6 times 8, which is equal to 48.

84
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,530
So if you want to know the fraction that's covered by the

85
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,040
trim, it'd be 28 over 48, which is equal to-- let's see,

86
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:58,350
you divide the top and bottom by 4-- 7 over 12, 7/12.

87
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,130
And that's choice D.

88
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,240
Next question, 113.

89
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:17,350
If a is equal to minus 0.3, which of the following is true?

90
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,040
OK, so they have a bunch of statements that relate a--

91
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm just trying to see the pattern in the--So in all of these

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,560
choices, they're relating a to a squared, to a to the third,

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,060
and then they're putting it in order.

94
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,660
They're saying which of these is the least, then next,

95
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,310
and then the greatest. So let's just figure it out.

96
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:49,020
a is minus 0.3. What's a squared?

97
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,220
So it's going to be positive.

98
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,610
Negative times a negative is a positive. And then 3 times 3,

99
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,570
and we're going to have two digits behind the decimal, right?

100
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:01,040
Because 0.3 times 0.3. So it's going to be positive 0.09.

101
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,030
And then what's a to the third? Well, 0.09 times 0.3.

102
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,320
9 times 3 is 27.

103
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,840
And we're going to have 1, 2, 3 numbers behind the decimal

104
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,020
spot, so it'd be 0.027.

105
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,750
And we have a negative times a positive,

106
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,480
so it's going to be negative. So let's put these in order.

107
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,570
Which of these is the smallest number? So think about it.

108
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,600
The smallest number is going to be the one that's actually

109
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,740
the most negative. So this right here is the most negative.

110
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,030
Minus 0.3 is the most negative.

111
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,830
We could even draw a number line here.

112
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:42,020
You could have minus 0.3, which is a.

113
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,010
Then you have minus 0.027, which is a to the third.

114
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,840
And then you have 0 some place.

115
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,180
And then you have 0.09, which is a squared.

116
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,510
So the correct answer should be a is less than a to the third

117
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:05,250
which is less than a squared. And that is choice B.

118
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,030
Problem 114. Let me switch colors.

119
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,020
Which of the following is the product of two integers

120
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,520
whose sum is 11.

121
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,690
So they're telling us that x plus y is equal to 11.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,970
And which one is the product? So xy is equal to what?

123
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,000
So let's think about it.

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,020
Which of the following is a product of two integers

125
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,040
whose sum is 11? So this is interesting.

126
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,100
Maybe we just have to do some experimentation right now.

127
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,020
We could we could be dealing with negative numbers here.

128
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,010
So let's think about how we can rearrange this.

129
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm just experimenting.

130
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,180
Let's see, if we have y is equal to 11 minus x,

131
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,280
does that give us an intuition?

132
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,910
Then xy is equal to 11 minus x, because y is 11 minus x.

133
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:14,000
That equals 11x minus x squared,where x is really any integer

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,160
So if you put a 1 there, you could you could get a 10.

135
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,040
They don't tell us that they're greater than 0.

136
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:38,330
So let me think about this. So 32 is 8 and 4. 26 is 13 and 2.

137
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,840
Let me look at all those choices.

138
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,740
This one has me temporarily stumped, hopefully temporarily.

139
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,000
So minus 42, what are the different ways I could get there?

140
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,020
I can get 21 and 2.

141
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,370
I could get 7 and 6, but one would have to be positive and

142
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:08,650
one would have to be negative.I can get 14 and 3, 14 times 3.

143
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,530
And actually if I have 14 times minus 3,

144
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,490
what is that equal to?

145
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:20,310
It's minus 42, and then 14 plus minus 3, and that equals 11.

146
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,040
So it's answer A.

147
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,660
I wish I could give you an better analytical way of doing it

148
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,000
instead of just experimenting with numbers.

149
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was just trying to figure out what equals 42.

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,030
Which of the following is a product of two integers

151
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,810
whose sum is 11?

152
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,070
I guess a more systematic way of doing it might have been to

153
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,660
just say what are the factors of 42?

154
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:57,310
It'd be 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, and then 6 and 7.

155
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,760
And you say OK, if I-- and since this is a negative number,

156
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,970
one of these has to be positive and one has to be negative--

157
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,080
so if I were to take a positive 1 of one of these,

158
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,200
and a negative 1 of one of these, and add them up,

159
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,020
can I get to 11?

160
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,070
And I guess that's where your brain should say,

161
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,160
oh, 14 minus 3, that is equal to 11.

162
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,180
And luckily it was choice A,

163
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,060
and you didn't have to go any further.

164
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,530
But you would have to do this with every one from there.

165
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,710
You might want to look at the solutions.

166
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,430
Maybe they have more elegant solution to this.

167
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,000
Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.
