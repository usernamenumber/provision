1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,220
   

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,390
In the last video, we talked a
little bit about compounding

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,480
interest. Our example was
interest that compounds

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,830
annually, not continuously
like we would

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,790
see in a lot of banks.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,390
I'll really just wanted to let
you understand that although

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,290
the idea is simple.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,040
Every year you get 10% of the
money that you started off

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,650
with that year.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,720
And it's called compounding
because the next year you get

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,900
money not just on your initial
deposit, but you also get

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,300
money or interest on the
interest from previous years.

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,470
That's why it's called
compounding interest. And

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,290
although that idea is pretty
simple, we saw that the math

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,420
can get a little tricky.

16
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,950
If you have a reasonable
calculator, you can solve for

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,870
some of these things if
you know how to do it.

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,550
But it's nearly impossible to
actually do it in your head.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,640
For example, at the end of the
last video, we said if I have

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,700
a hundred dollars.

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,860
And if I'm compounding at 10%
a year, that's where this 1

22
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,350
comes from, how long does it
take for me to double my money

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,910
and end up with this equation?

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,420
And to solve that equation, most
calculators don't have at

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,110
log base 1.1.

26
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,970
And I've shown this
in other videos.

27
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,050
This you could also say, x is
equal to log base 10 of 2,

28
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,610
divided by log base 1.1 of 2.

29
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,900
This is another way to calculate
log base 1.1 of 2.

30
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,620
This should be log
base 10 of 1.1.

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,290
I say this because most
calculators have

32
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,700
a log base 10 function.

33
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,620
And this and this
are equivalent.

34
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,320
I've proven it in
other videos.

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
So in order to say how long
does it take to double my

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,020
money at 10% a year?

37
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,690
You'd have to put that
in your calculator.

38
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,860
And let's try it out.

39
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,210
Let's try it out right here.

40
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,030
We're going to have, 2, and
we're going to take the

41
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:56,090
logarithm of that, 0.3, divided
by 1.1, and the

42
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,950
logarithm of that.

43
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,440
We close the parentheses.

44
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,710
Is equal to 7.27 years.

45
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,350
Roughly 7.3 years.

46
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,410
So this is roughly equal
to 7.3 years.

47
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,280
As we saw in the last video,
this is not necessarily

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,220
trivial to set up, but even if
you understand the math here,

49
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,590
it's not easy to do
this in your head.

50
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,720
It's literally almost impossible
to do in your head.

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,640
So what I want to show
you is a rule to

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,400
approximate this question.

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
How long does it take for you
to doubles your money?

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,060
And that rule is called
the rule of 72.

55
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,380
Sometimes it's the rule of
70 or the rule of 69.

56
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,350
But rule of 72 tends to be the
most typical one, especially

57
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,900
when you're talking about
compounding over

58
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,000
set periods of time.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,590
Maybe not continuous
compounding.

60
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,670
Continuous compounding you'll
get closer to 69 or 70.

61
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,690
But I'll show you what
I mean in a second.

62
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,250
So to answer that same question,
let's say I have 10%

63
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,500
compounding annually.

64
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:06,990
   

65
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,470
Using the rule of 72, I say how
long does it take for me

66
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,740
to double my money?

67
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,500
I literally take 72, that's why
it's called the rule of

68
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,570
72, I divide it by
the percentage.

69
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,780
So the percentage is 10.

70
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,780
It's decimal representation
is 0.1.

71
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,460
But it's 10 per 100
percentage.

72
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,490
So 72 two divided by 10.

73
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:33,380
And I get 7.2, it was annual,
so 7.2 years.

74
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,680
If this was 10% compounding
monthly, it

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,320
would be 7.2 months.

76
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,210
So I got 7.2 years, which is
pretty darn close to what we

77
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,910
got by doing all that
fancy math.

78
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,460
Similarly, let's say that
I'm compounding--

79
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,230
let's do another problem.

80
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,420
Let's say I have 6% compounding
annually.

81
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:04,370
   

82
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:11,020
Using the rule of 72, I just
take 72 divided by the 6.

83
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,465
And I get 6 goes into
72, 12 times.

84
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:19,060
So it'll take 12 years for me
to double my money, if I'm

85
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,350
getting 6% on my money
compounding annually.

86
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,570
Let's see if that works out.

87
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,530
So we learned last time, the
other way to solve this would

88
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,490
literally be, we would say x,
the answer to this, should be

89
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:38,310
close to log base anything of
2 divided by-- this is where

90
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,150
we get the doubling our money
from, the 2 means 2 times our

91
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,880
money-- divided by log base
whatever this is 10 of.

92
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,780
In this case instead of 1.1
it's going to be 1.06.

93
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,270
So you can already see it's a
little bit more difficult.

94
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,460
Get our calculator out.

95
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:04,770
So we have 2, log of that,
divided by 1.06, log of that,

96
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,680
is equal to 11.89.

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,500
So about 11.9.

98
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,540
So when you do all the fancy
math, we got 11.9.

99
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,330
So once again you see this is
a pretty good approximation,

100
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,720
and this math is much simpler
than this math.

101
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,300
And I think most of us can
do this in our heads.

102
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,960
So this is actually a good
way to impress people.

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,890
And just to get a better sense
of how good this number 72 is,

104
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,690
what I did is I plotted
on a spreadsheet.

105
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,760
I said, OK, here's the different
interest rates.

106
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,180
This is the actual time it
would take to double.

107
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,340
So I'm actually using this
formula right here to figure

108
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,900
out the precise amount of time
it'll take to double.

109
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,790
Let's say this is in years if
we're compounding annually.

110
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,190
So if you're at 1%, it'll
take you 70 years

111
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:55,980
to double your money.

112
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,460
At 25% it'll only take you a
little over 3 years to double

113
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,710
your money.

114
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,960
   

115
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,870
This is the correct-- and
I'll do this in blue--

116
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,970
number right here.

117
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,220
So this is actual.

118
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:19,570
   

119
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,310
And I plotted it here, too.

120
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,450
If you look at the blue line,
that's the actual.

121
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,140
I didn't plot all of them.

122
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,600
I think I started at maybe 4%.

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,560
So if you look at 4%, it
takes you 17.6 years

124
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,370
to double your money.

125
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,360
So 4%, it takes 17.6 years
to double your money.

126
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,450
So that's that dot right
there on the blue.

127
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:46,270
At 5% percent, it takes you 14
years to double your money.

128
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,200
And so this should also give you
an appreciation that every

129
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,780
percentage really does matter
when you're talking about

130
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,490
compounding interest. When it
takes 2%, it takes you 35

131
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,310
years to double your money.

132
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,490
1% takes you 70 years.

133
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,900
You double your money twice
as fast. It it really is

134
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,680
important, especially if you
think about doubling your

135
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,230
money, or even tripling your
money for that matter.

136
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:13,200
Now in red, I said what does
the rule of 72 predict?

137
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,280
So if you just take 72 and
divided it by 1%, you get 72.

138
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,730
If you take 72 divided
by 4, you get 18.

139
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,100
Rule of 72 says it'll take you
18 years to double your money

140
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,580
at a 4% interest rate,
when the actual

141
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,520
answer is 17.7 years.

142
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,420
So it's pretty close.

143
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,455
So that's what's in
red right there.

144
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,490
   

145
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,820
So I've plotted it here.

146
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,680
The curves are pretty close.

147
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,510
For low interest rates, so
that's these interest rates

148
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:53,140
over here, the rule of 72
slightly over estimates how

149
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,880
long it'll take to double
your money.

150
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,610
And as you get to higher
interest rates, it slightly

151
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,340
underestimates how long it'll
take you to double your money.

152
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,090
If you had to think about is
72 really the best number?

153
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,840
Well this is kind
of what I did.

154
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,340
If you just take the interest
rate and you multiply it by

155
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,270
the actual doubling time.

156
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,790
And here you get a
bunch of numbers.

157
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,940
For low interest rate
69 works good.

158
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,360
For very high interest
rates 78 works good.

159
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,470
But if you look at this, 72
looks like a pretty good

160
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,290
approximation.

161
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,150
You can see it took us pretty
well all the way from 4% all

162
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,620
the way to 25%.

163
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,310
Which is most of the interest
rates most of us are going to

164
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,409
deal with for most
of our lives.

165
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,299
So hopefully you found
that useful.

166
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,750
It's a very easy way to figure
out how fast it's going to

167
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,530
take you to double your money.

168
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,015
Let's do one more,
just for fun.

169
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:44,680
   

170
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,480
Let's say I have a 9% percent
annual compounding.

171
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,500
And how long does it take for
me to double my money?

172
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,610
Well 72 divided by 9 is
equal to 8 years.

173
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,810
It'll take me 8 years
to double my money.

174
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,200
And the actual answer-- this
is the approximate answer

175
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,190
using the rule of 72--
9% is 8.04 years.

176
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,940
So once again, in our head we
were able to do a very good

177
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,190
approximation.

178
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:27,858
