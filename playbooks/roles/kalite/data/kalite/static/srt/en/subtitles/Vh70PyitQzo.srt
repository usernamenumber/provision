00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,700
We've talked a lot about convex lenses,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,680
so I thought I would do a quick video on concave lenses,

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,440
although there aren't as many combinations

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,000
of what a concave lens can do.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,930
So just remember,

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,050
concave has the word 'cave' in it

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,410
so I always imagine that it's kind of caving inwards

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,940
caving inwards

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,770
It's a little bit of an exaggerated drawing

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,590
but you get the general idea

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,990
this is a concave lens right over here

12
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,440
and let me draw its principle axis

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,480
so this is its princinpal axis

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,060
shouldn't curve at the beginning

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,240
just redraw it, so that's its principle axis

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,710
and let me draw the two focal points

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,400
let me draw one over here on the left side

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,810
and then an equal distance focal distance on the right side

19
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,370
and I'm assuming that the two surfaces are both concave

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,850
and they are symmetric over here

21
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,630
Just an assumption I'm making

22
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,440
Now lets think about what's gonna happen

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,000
if I put an object some place

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,060
on the left side of this concave lens

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,960
So I can put it, let me just stick it anywhere

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,400
So let me just stick it right over there

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,980
So, if I do and like always,

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,500
we will do our two raysŁŹbut with a concave lens,

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,030
I'm only gonna do two rays

30
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,000
one that is parallel to the principle axis

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,020
and then I'm gonna do one that does not get diffracted

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,020
so it goes right through the center of the lens

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,040
and let's think about what happens.

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,460
So, if we go parallel, to the principal axis,

35
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,380
this will get diffracted away, since it's coming in parallel

36
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,370
and it will get diffracted outwards

37
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,960
so that it looks like it's coming from this focus.

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,370
So it will get diffracted in a way

39
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,070
so it looks like its coming from that focus

40
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,000
So its getting diverged outwards

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let me draw another point or another ray, I should say

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,030
I will do that in yellow

43
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,260
and this will just gonna straight

44
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,690
through the centre of the lens and not get diffracted

45
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,000
So its just gonna go straight through the lens

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,780
and not get diffracted

47
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,170
So what will the image be here?

48
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,880
Well clearly, these two rays don't converge

49
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,490
so we won't have a real image

50
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,740
but they do both look like they are diverging from someplace

51
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,960
and they look like they are diverging from right over there

52
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,700
so look to an observer out here

53
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,790
if their eyeball is right over there

54
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:35,390
I could draw their nose, just make it clear where the eye is

55
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,670
If they look at from this side,

56
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:44,100
they are going to see a virtual image of the image right over here

57
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,050
Just like that

58
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,010
So you're actually gonna see is a virtual image of the object

59
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,130
that is not inverted and it's gonna be smaller

60
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,250
its gonna look like it's closer to the lens than it really is

61
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,160
Anyway, that's all it really is to know,

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,400
obviously there's a lot you can know about anything.

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,580
but that's the general gist about the convex lenses
