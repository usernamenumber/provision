1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430
   

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,760
We're on problem 21.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,330
In the figure below, n
is a whole number.

4
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:05,880
All right.

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,720
What is the smallest possible
value for n?

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,650
OK, both of these sides are n.

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,380
And so this is something that's
actually really good to

8
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,190
get this intuition.

9
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,870
Because this shows up on all
sorts of standardized tests.

10
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,550
And so let's think about how
small can we make n.

11
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,600
So the lower the top of
this pyramid becomes,

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,550
the smaller n becomes.

13
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,130
If we pushed this top of the
pyramid really high then n

14
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,720
would have to be really big.

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,688
For example, if we made the
triangle into that.

16
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:37,380
Then clearly, this length is
shorter than that length.

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,540
We want to keep lowering it to
get as small a possible n.

18
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,310
But what happens if we lowered
it all the way?

19
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,350
If we flattened this triangle.

20
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,970
If we just flattened it
all the way down.

21
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,690
So essentially this would be the
top of it and this would

22
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,080
be n and this would be n.

23
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,780
I hope you're visualizing
that properly.

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,520
I've flattened the triangle.

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,840
So these two sides would just
go flat with the base.

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,010
And so this top if I
were to do it in

27
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,420
magenta, is right here.

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,170
So this is as small
as n could get.

29
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,920
One could argue whether this is
a triangle at all anymore.

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,340
It's really a line now, because
I've squished out all

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,530
of the area in there.

32
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,070
But even in this case, n would
have to be, in the smallest

33
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,220
case, it would be 7.5.

34
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,050
Each n would be half
of this 15.

35
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,610
So, as we push this base down,
that's kind of the limit that

36
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,390
n approaches.

37
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,950
n cannot be any smaller
than 7.5.

38
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,640
And they tell us that
n is a whole number.

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,500
So n has to be greater
than 7.5 in order for

40
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,680
this to be a triangle.

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,460
And n is a whole number,
so n is equal to 8.

42
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,880
That's choice C.

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,920
And that's an important
intuition to have in general.

44
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,830
That the third side of a
triangle can never be bigger

45
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,100
than two of the other
sides combined.

46
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,540
Then you're dealing with
something else.

47
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,010
You're not dealing
with a triangle.

48
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,020
Even if the third side is equal
to the other two sides,

49
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,190
then you're actually dealing
with a line.

50
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,980
Because you'd have to squish
out all of the area of the

51
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,910
triangle in order
to get there.

52
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,520
Anyway, I like that problem.

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,770
Next question.

54
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,860
I think, just eyeballing
it, they want us

55
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,330
to do the same thing.

56
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,580
Same type of intuition.

57
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,270
   

58
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,170
And I had my rant in the last
video about how they weren't

59
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,090
doing problems that give
you intuition or

60
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,420
that test your intuition.

61
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,650
But I'll take that back, because
I think that's what

62
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,010
they are testing now.

63
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,250
Which of the following sets of
numbers could represent the

64
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,760
lengths of the sides
of a triangle.

65
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,670
2, and 2, and 5.

66
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,190
So this is the same
thing again.

67
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,150
How can I have two sides of
a triangle combined being

68
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,200
shorter than the third side.

69
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,590
If I had a side of length 2, and
then I had another side of

70
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,620
length 2, there's no way that
this last side could be 5.

71
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,780
Even if I completely flattened
this triangle, 2 and 2, the

72
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,615
longest that this last
side, this third

73
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,500
side, could be is 4.

74
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,970
So that can't be a triangle.

75
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,500
Same here, let's look
at the other ones.

76
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,360
3, 3, and 5.

77
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,970
That's no reason why that
can't be a triangle.

78
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,260
3 and 3 is 6.

79
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,590
So even if I flattened it out
a lot, then this side can be

80
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,920
as long as 6.

81
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,590
And obviously I could squeeze
them together like this.

82
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,550
3 and 3, and then this little
third side could be something

83
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,030
really small.

84
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,970
Because it's anything
in between 0 and 6.

85
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,210
So obviously it can be 5.

86
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,900
So that's going to
be the answer.

87
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,950
4, 4 and 8.

88
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,840
Same problem.

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,515
I would have to squish
the triangle so much.

90
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:40,890
If those are two of the sides,
4 and 4, this last side is

91
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,590
still going to be less than 8.

92
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,370
The only way to get it to 8 is
if I push the top of this

93
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,280
triangle all the way down and
essentially make it a line.

94
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,830
Once again, one side of a
triangle can't be bigger than

95
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,860
two of the other
sides combined.

96
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,360
In fact, it can't be
equal to two of

97
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,320
the other sides combined.

98
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,920
Then we're dealing
with a line.

99
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,890
So they're really testing
that same intuition.

100
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,890
And the choice is B.

101
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,080
23.

102
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,330
Copy and paste this.

103
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,350
   

104
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,770
OK.

105
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,220
I try to avoid talking when
I'm copying and pasting

106
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,630
because I think it slows
down my computer.

107
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,910
In the accompanying diagram,
parallel lines L and M are cut

108
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,760
by transversal T.

109
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,860
So it's a classic parallel
line with

110
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,300
a transversal problem.

111
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,050
And they're parallel.

112
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,760
That's why I did those arrows.

113
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,575
Which statements about angle
1 and 2 must be true?

114
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:34,120
   

115
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,350
I don't know if you've seen the
Khan Academy videos of the

116
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,290
angle game, but that's what
we're going to play here, the

117
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,720
angle game.

118
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,670
So angle 1, if you want to
look at its corresponding

119
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,020
angle, its corresponding angle
on the other parallel line, or

120
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,340
with the transversal and
the other parallel

121
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,980
line, is right there.

122
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,580
And they're going
to be congruent.

123
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,710
Those two angles are going
to be congruent.

124
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,790
So you could say this is equal
to the measure of angle 1.

125
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,530
I've picked up their terminology
well, I think.

126
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,380
So this is equal to the
measure of angle 1.

127
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,070
And this is obviously angle 2.

128
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,380
You see immediately that they
have to be supplementary.

129
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,450
Because when you add them
together you get 180 degrees.

130
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,310
Together they go all the
way around and they

131
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,960
kind of form a line.

132
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,700
So you know that if this angle
and this angle are

133
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,050
supplementary.

134
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,330
And this angle is congruent to
angle 1, then angle 1 and

135
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,330
angle 2 must be supplementary.

136
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,760
So what do they say?

137
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,600
Angle 1 is definitely
not necessarily

138
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,610
congruent to angle 2.

139
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,370
It's congruent to
this angle here.

140
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,980
Angle 1 is a complement
of angle 2.

141
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,390
Complement means you
add up to 90.

142
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,060
No, we're talking about
supplement.

143
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,750
So it's not that.

144
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,630
Angle 1 is a supplement
of angle 2.

145
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,090
There you go.

146
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,750
And there's nothing that says
that they're right angles,

147
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,990
that's silly.

148
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,240
All right, next problem.

149
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,620
   

150
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,210
Let me copy and paste it.

151
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,160
OK.

152
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,810
And paste it.

153
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,130
Ready to go.

154
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,370
What values-- let me pick a good
color-- what values of A

155
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,070
and B make the quadrilateral
MNOP a parallelogram.

156
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,620
For this to be a parallelogram,
the opposite

157
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,890
sides have to be equal.

158
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,790
And I challenge you to
experiment to draw a

159
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,830
parallelogram where opposite
sides are parallel where the

160
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,120
opposite sides are
also not equal.

161
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,110
If you make two of the sides not
equal, then the other two

162
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,550
lines aren't going to
be parallel anymore.

163
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,190
And you can play with
that if you like.

164
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,070
But if opposite sides are going
to be equal that means

165
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:40,820
4A plus B is equal to 21.

166
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,570
Because they're opposite sides,
so they should be equal

167
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,780
to each other.

168
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,370
Similarly, 3A minus 2B should be
equal to 13 because they're

169
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,860
opposite sides.

170
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,750
So 3A minus 2B is equal to 13.

171
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,400
And now we have two linear
equations with two unknowns.

172
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,460
So this is really an Algebra
1 problem in disguise.

173
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,860
So let's see, they want
us to solve for both.

174
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,900
Let's see if we can
cancel out B.

175
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,930
So let's multiply this
top equation by 2.

176
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,980
And I'm doing that to
cancel out the B's.

177
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:22,570
So you get 8A plus 2B
is equal to 42.

178
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,720
And I did that so that the 2B
and the minus 2B cancel out.

179
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,750
So let's add these two
equations to each.

180
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,850
The left-hand side,
3A plus 8A is 11A.

181
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,900
The B's cancel out; minus 2B,
plus 2B, that's no B's.

182
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,720
Is equal to 42 plus 13 is 55.

183
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,070
That worked out well.

184
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,380
Divide both sides by 11, you
get A is equal to 5.

185
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,460
Now if A is equal
to 5, what's B?

186
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,100
Let's substitute back into
that first equation.

187
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,290
Because you picked either.

188
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,940
So 4 times 5 plus B
is equal to 21.

189
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,150
20 plus B is equal to 21.

190
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,220
So subtract 20 from both
sides, B is equal to 1.

191
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,340
So A is 5, B is 1.

192
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,950
That is choice B.

193
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,580
Problem 25.

194
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,300
I think I have to
clear this now.

195
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:27,700
   

196
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,960
Quadrilateral ABCD is
a parallelogram.

197
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,010
If adjacent angles are
congruent, which statement

198
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,970
must be true?

199
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,570
All right.

200
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,750
So let me draw a
parallelogram.

201
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,860
Well, I'll do it quick
and dirty.

202
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,210
So a parallelogram says that
opposite sides are parallel.

203
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,490
That's parallel to that and
that's parallel to that.

204
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,800
But they give us another
statement.

205
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,690
They say if the adjacent
sides are congruent.

206
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,930
   

207
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,760
So they're saying that this
is congruent to that.

208
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,570
They are saying if adjacent
angles are congruent.

209
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,200
So I don't know if they're
saying it's just one of them

210
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,660
or all of them.

211
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,590
But it's the same
thing actually.

212
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,970
If that angle is congruent
to that angle, something

213
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,840
interesting has to happen.

214
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,520
They both have to
be 90 degrees.

215
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,940
And I want you to think about
that a little bit.

216
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,350
So let me just draw the kind
of bottom part of that

217
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,600
parellelogram.

218
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:26,380
   

219
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,450
And I drew it more so if you say
that this line right here

220
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,700
is a transversal.

221
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,330
   

222
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,370
And that since it's a
parallelogram, we know that

223
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,155
this line is parallel
to that line.

224
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:44,430
   

225
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,320
So we have a transversal
between parallel lines.

226
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,310
This angle is congruent
to that angle, they're

227
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,810
corresponding angles.

228
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,670
And this angle is a supplement
to this angle.

229
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,620
They have to add up to 180.

230
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,910
So this angle, this red angle
and this brown angle have to

231
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,770
be supplements.

232
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,760
Or if we said angle
1 and angle 2.

233
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,200
They have to add up to 180.

234
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,480
Measure of angle 1 plus measure
of angle 2 have to be

235
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,060
equal to 180.

236
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,020
But then they tell
us even more.

237
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,880
They tell you that they're
congruent.

238
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,470
These are adjacent
angles, right?

239
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,950
That's angle 1 and
that's angle 2.

240
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,910
They're adjacent.

241
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,320
So if both of these are
congruent, if their measures

242
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,310
equal each other, they both
have to be equal to 90.

243
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,290
So if adjacent angles
are congruent in the

244
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,430
parallelogram, then these
angles are 90.

245
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,760
And if these angles are 90,
those are going to be 90 by

246
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,990
the same argument.

247
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,430
So now we're not dealing with
just a parallelogram.

248
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,815
Well, I did want to draw
it all filled in.

249
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:44,170
It looks tacky.

250
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,330
It's a rectangle.

251
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,070
They say quadrilateral
ABCD is a square.

252
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,550
It could be a square, but in
order for it to be a square

253
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,000
they'd have to tell us that
all the sides are equal to

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,040
each other.

255
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,510
So it's not A.

256
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,350
That could happen, it
doesn't have to be.

257
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,230
ABCD is a rhombus.

258
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,050
No, in a rhombus all the
sides have to be

259
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,330
equal to each other.

260
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,610
They didn't tell us that.

261
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,780
ABCD is a rectangle.

262
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,330
Sure.

263
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,280
Because we know all the angles
now are 90 degrees.

264
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,180
And that is choice C.

265
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,430
See you in the next video.

266
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,050
