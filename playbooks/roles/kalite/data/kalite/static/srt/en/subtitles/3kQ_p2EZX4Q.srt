1
00:00:00,405 --> 00:00:04,523
[music playing]

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:10,899
We thought we would start by looking at what is perhaps the most famous painting in the world,

3
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:13,120
and whether we can actually even really still see it.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,933
Right. 'Cause I have seen this before.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:20,698
I've even visited it at the "Louvre," and I'm pronouncing it wrong.

6
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:25,215
Yes, you're right. This is probably the most famous painting in the world.

7
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:30,722
And I just read that most people spend about 15 seconds in the Louvre

8
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:33,951
looking at the painting, which is a funny statistic.

9
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,077
Well, it's stressful! Because there's people behind you.

10
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,937
And on top of that, it's actually surprisingly small,

11
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:40,300
when you see it in real life.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,062
I mean, now that I'm able to take my time

13
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:44,351
and not worry about the tourists behind me,

14
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:47,087
and I'm looking at it for real, I'm already . . .

15
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:49,647
things are jumping out at me that I actually had never noticed before.

16
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:50,514
Like what?

17
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:55,028
Well, it looks like the scenery is some kind of like Vulcan territory or something.

18
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:57,635
[chuckling] There's this, it's like mountainous,

19
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:00,635
and there's a little bridge in there, there's a road;

20
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:03,515
I guess I never paid much attention to that before.

21
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:06,191
Yeah, actually I had never even noticed this chair she was on before, either,

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,946
you can see her hand resting on.

23
00:01:07,946 --> 00:01:10,677
Actually, and I never noticed that there's a ledge right behind her

24
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:12,949
where there's like, jars. [chuckling]

25
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,882
I could probably keep going.

26
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:19,999
I like your analogy to Vulcan territory, as a Star Trek fan myself.

27
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:23,484
That landscape is otherwordly and very mysterious.

28
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,327
But it's interesting, isn't it, how the bottom part of the landscape

29
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:30,446
at her neck and below looks like an inhabited landscape,

30
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:32,567
with a winding road and a bridge;

31
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,885
but the landscape that's at her neck and head

32
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:39,721
is more mysterious and looks very much like another planet.

33
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:40,552
That's right.

34
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:42,637
And actually, when you point that out,

35
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,533
and how that painting is divided based on

36
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,692
where those landscapes and the ledge divide the painting,

37
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:48,398
I don't have my ruler out,

38
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:50,602
but I would guess that it's pretty close to the "golden mean."

39
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:52,815
I think you're probably right.

40
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:53,948
Those things that look like jars

41
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:59,753
are actually the bottom of columns cut off on either side of the painting.

42
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,721
So, so Leonardo da Vinci actually painted the columns,

43
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:04,151
and it was cropped.

44
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:07,016
That's right. And so the space that she's in

45
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:09,815
would have made a lot more sense as a balcony.

46
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:12,603
You know, all of this, actually, if you just take a step back,

47
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:15,429
we started with this presumption that it's the - and it's true -

48
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:17,870
that it's probably the most famous painting in the world,

49
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,698
but I guess I've never quite gotten why.

50
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:22,750
I mean, is this just a case of marketing?

51
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,568
I think it happened in 1911 when the painting was stolen

52
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:29,636
from the Louvre and disappeared for a couple of years,

53
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:31,936
and became notorious at that point.

54
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:33,240
In the 19th century,

55
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,790
the Mona Lisa was not the most popular painting at the Louvre.

56
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,620
Paintings by other artists like Titian and Raphael

57
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,831
were much more popular,

58
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:44,533
and even valued more highly for insurance purposes.

59
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,400
So, it really probably is only in the 20th century

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,350
that she became as important as she is now.

61
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,187
If you go back 150 years ago,

62
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:55,634
Mona Lisa was not something that was just ingrained in our culture.

63
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,178
She was important; people were interested in her,

64
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,367
and people were writing about her,

65
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,637
and they said some interesting things;

66
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:03,860
but she wasn't as famous as she is now.

67
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,300
And also, don't forget that the technology to reproduce her

68
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,231
existed only really in the 20th century,

69
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,720
in terms of mass color reproductions.

70
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,432
And so, her currency has certainly increased, I think,

71
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:17,203
in the last hundred years or so.

72
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:18,963
I see. If you go back 150 years,

73
00:03:18,963 --> 00:03:21,738
there was probably no such thing as super-famous paintings.

74
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:24,431
I think that might be true, actually.

75
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:27,291
There were paintings that were famous, or important,

76
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,454
but not celebrities, in the way that the Mona Lisa is.

77
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:31,790
Right, right. Not something that every person on the street would recognize.

78
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,175
Yeah. And of course, now I think most people would say

79
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:38,168
that what's so interesting about her is her look and her smile,

80
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:40,958
which have been interpreted in many different ways.

81
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,023
Yeah, I know, and I know that's kind of what,

82
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,125
I guess, one of the claims to fame of the painting.

83
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,470
And you see that, I mean, you know,

84
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,973
people like to look at it, is she smirking, is she happy,

85
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:52,040
is she sad, all of these things, is she looking at you,

86
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,788
all of these things that people try to . . .

87
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:58,009
but I guess, trying to look at it without all of the social programming

88
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,567
that I've had around this painting,

89
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:02,442
it strikes me as an interesting painting,

90
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,440
and it seems very technically well done,

91
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,278
and there's something very bright,

92
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:08,405
and there's kind of an aura around her face.

93
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:12,092
I don't know, if I wasn't programmed to really know this painting,

94
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,550
and if I were to see this in the museum

95
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,021
amongst many, many others, that I would . . .

96
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,385
that it would really jump out at me.

97
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:18,837
Portraits really took off during the Renaissance,

98
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:24,021
beginning in the 1400's in Italy, and Leonardo painted this in Florence;

99
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:26,723
and that's because of Humanism.

100
00:04:26,723 --> 00:04:28,260
And the way that we define Humanism is

101
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,293
taking an interest in human beings and the things of this world

102
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:35,349
and human achievement and individuality,

103
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:39,236
all of those values becoming more important in the 15th century.

104
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:42,317
And so we begin to see a lot more portraits.

105
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:46,142
Also with the beginnings of a wealthy merchant class

106
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:48,063
in Florence in the 15th century,

107
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:50,778
people can afford portraits and begin to want them.

108
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:53,954
At first portraits were painted with the figure in profile.

109
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:59,805
But later, especially in Northern Europe, artists like DÃ¼rer or Memling

110
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:03,809
started to put their figures in believable spaces.

111
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:07,490
And so, Leonardo is really the first artist in Italy

112
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,104
to do those things: to make an oil painting,

113
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,611
which is a relatively new medium, in Italy -

114
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:13,798
-What did people use before oil?

115
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:15,785
They used fresco and tempera painting.

116
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:17,907
Tempera for panel paintings.

117
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:19,378
So this is oil on wood,

118
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:22,205
whereas before artists would paint tempera on wood.

119
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:25,774
Tempera tends to look more flat than oil paint,

120
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:28,609
where you can really get a sense of modeling,

121
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:32,142
and light and dark; so Leonardo's making this three-dimensional figure,

122
00:05:32,142 --> 00:05:35,572
and he's using another technique called sfumato,

123
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:38,127
which means a kind of smoky haziness;

124
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:42,029
so he obscures the hard outlines around the forms, which tend to flatten them.

125
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:46,342
One of the things that's fun to talk about with the Mona Lisa, too,

126
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:48,606
is all the things that people have said about her over the years.

127
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:50,326
You might not be aware of the fact that

128
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:54,880
Sigmund Freud actually had a particular interpretation of the Mona Lisa.

129
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,526
Yes, I'm sure he did. [chuckling] I'm somewhat skeptical of it.

130
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,680
I would like to interpret his interpretation someday. But yes.

131
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,703
Freud said that the Mona Lisa's smile combined the two ways

132
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:09,947
that we tend to look at women in our culture.

133
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:13,293
In one way she's very mothering and nurturing;

134
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:16,195
and in the other way she seems very seductive.

135
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:18,588
I think that says more about Freud than about Leonardo.

136
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:21,840
You could be right. And later artists,

137
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,891
another artist that you already know, Duchamp,

138
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:25,214
Duchamps, my favorite.

139
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:28,840
-your favorite, he took a reproduction of the Mona Lisa

140
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,998
and drew a mustache on her.

141
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:32,910
I could imagine him doing that.

142
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,579
I think the mustache is interesting. Because there is something

143
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,960
not entirely feminine about her, something a little bit masculine.

144
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,806
Do you think it's that? or I mean, I guess that there's a certain,

145
00:06:41,806 --> 00:06:44,161
I mean, it's kind of old now, especially because Duchamp did it,

146
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:46,198
I'm guessing, you know, 80, 90 years ago.

147
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:51,210
But there is something hilarious about drawing a mustache on a feminine form.

148
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,797
We all remember doing it as schoolkids, just getting a kick out of it.

149
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:56,927
And I could see it's especially funny for this painting.

150
00:06:56,927 --> 00:07:01,244
Taking something that's so high art, and making it silly.

151
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:02,212
Exactly.

152
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:07,038
Recently, the Prado in Madrid found what turns out to be,

153
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,233
after some scientific testing, a copy of the Mona Lisa,

154
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:13,296
which in and of itself is not that unusual.

155
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:18,298
But it turns out that their copy was made by another artist

156
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:24,530
sitting right next to Leonardo, copying what he did stroke for stroke.

157
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,410
And they can tell this by analyzing the underdrawing.

158
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,926
She looks much younger.

159
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:30,509
She has eyebrows . . .

160
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:32,740
Oh, that's right. I mean, it makes you appreciate it.

161
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,883
That's where the creepiness comes from,

162
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:37,115
because the Mona Lisa we see looks jaundiced. It's yellow.

163
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:39,765
And so, the painting is a little bit different.

164
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:40,959
The face is a little bit different.

165
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,276
But we can assume that the colors might not have been that different.

166
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:47,291
Exactly. And it's a really interesting thing to think about

167
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,451
what she would look like if she was cleaned,

168
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:53,530
and if she would still mean what she means to us if she -

169
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,499
Oh, I don't think she would.

170
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:56,351
Because when I look at this cleaned painting, it . . .

171
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,451
it loses a lot of the mystery.

172
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:03,229
Yeah, I agree. And you can then understand the Louvre's decision not to clean her.

173
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:06,833
I mean, the cleaned one, she looks better, she looks younger.

174
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:11,944
She loses a lot of the motherly aspects that Freud seems to want to ascribe to her.

175
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:15,016
Yeah, because the colors are brighter, more vibrant;

176
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:17,962
it's not as muted as the one that we've learned to like.

177
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:21,781
Yeah. Although, her reputation has grown over the years.

178
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,644
Who's to say that we won't care so much about her again.

179
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:28,100
There might be a post-celebrity world at some point. [laughing]

180
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:32,103
