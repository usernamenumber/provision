1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,360
In the video on E2 reactions,
I showed you how a strong

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,630
base-- and all of this happened
simultaneously-- a

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,980
strong base can nab a hydrogen
off of this carbon right here.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,570
And it's just nabbing
the proton itself.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,200
It's not grabbing the hydrogen
and the electron.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,970
And then that electron goes to
this carbon right over there,

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,470
and then that allows that
carbon to give away the

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,660
electron that was forming a bond
with the chlorine to go

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,310
with the chlorine.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,300
This all happened at once.

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,140
The chloride got eliminated.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,020
Now, one thing that might pop
out in your brain is why did I

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,510
pick this hydrogen?

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,850
Why did I pick the hydrogen
right over here?

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,550
Why couldn't I have picked
that hydrogen over there?

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,010
And I'm going to introduce you
to a little bit of terminology

18
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,750
and then I'll introduce
you to a rule.

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,350
And then I'll tell you a little
bit about why people

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,290
think this rule works.

21
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,100
So in general, the carbon that
has the functional group on

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,960
it, that's the alpha carbon.

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,020
So let me label it.

24
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,920
This carbon right here
is the alpha carbon.

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,420
And in order to have an E2
reaction in this case, when we

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,855
did the video on E2 reactions,
but actually, the rule will

27
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:10,890
hold as well for E1 reactions.

28
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,040
But in order to have the E2
reaction, the hydrogen has to

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,530
get swiped off of
a beta carbon.

30
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,280
And a beta carbon is just a
carbon that's one away from

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,150
the alpha carbon.

32
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,000
So this is a beta carbon and
this is also a beta carbon.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,050
And so it's completely
reasonable one would think

34
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,840
that, well, I could swipe it
from there or I could swipe it

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,440
from there.

36
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,770
And let's think about
this reaction.

37
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,520
Let's just draw it out, so
you can visualize it

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,650
a little bit better.

39
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,940
So here we swiped it from
this beta carbon.

40
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,220
Let me redraw the reaction where
we're swiping it from

41
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,350
the other beta carbons.

42
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,110
I want both reactions on the
screen at the same time.

43
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,430
Let me draw our methoxide.

44
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,050
So we have our oxygen bonded
to a CH3 to a methyl group.

45
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:03,040
The oxygen has seven valence
electrons: one, two, three,

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,150
four, five, six, seven.

47
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,229
I'll do the seventh one.

48
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,810
The one that will bond
with the hydrogen,

49
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,260
I'll do it in green.

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,550
Instead of attacking that
hydrogen or taking that

51
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,590
proton, I should say, because
it's not taking the electron

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,460
with it, it does
it to this one.

53
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,210
So what it does is it takes this
proton or it bonds with

54
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,850
that hydrogen proton, and then
the hydrogen protons or that

55
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,280
hydrogen's electron can then be
taken by this molecule, so

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,710
then it goes to the alpha carbon
to form a double bond

57
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,560
between this beta carbon
and the alpha carbon.

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,280
And so now, this alpha carbon
got that electron.

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,460
It doesn't need the electron
that's bonded with the chloro

60
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,640
group anymore, and so
that goes to the

61
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,700
chlorine to form chloride.

62
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,850
Chlorine was already way
more electronegative.

63
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,940
It was already hogging it.

64
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,630
Now it gets to go there.

65
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,030
And now, when all is
said and done, our

66
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,050
products look like this.

67
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,650
So we still have the methanol
just like we had in the

68
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,650
original reaction because this
grabbed this hydrogen.

69
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,370
Let me draw it.

70
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,175
So you have your OCH3.

71
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:15,770
   

72
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,170
Let me draw all of this in.

73
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,500
You have that pair
right over there.

74
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,570
You have this pair
right over here.

75
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,880
And then you have this purple
electron and now it's bonded

76
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,690
with this green electron, which
is now on the hydrogen.

77
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,430
So it is now bonded with this
green electron that has been

78
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,580
given to the hydrogen.

79
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,820
Oh, and make sure
we don't forget.

80
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,370
This oxygen over here had seven
valence electrons, so it

81
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,610
had a negative charge.

82
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,440
Neutral oxygen would have six.

83
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,340
So this had a negative charge.

84
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,800
But now that it gave its
electron to this hydrogen, it

85
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,140
now has a neutral charge.

86
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,170
It is now methanol.

87
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,800
Exactly what we saw
when we first

88
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,510
learned about E1 reactions.

89
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,880
We also know the chloro group,
it took that electron.

90
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,120
It's now a chloride anion.

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,500
So let me draw that.

92
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,730
And that's exactly the
same as in the

93
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,160
first video on E1 reactions.

94
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,400
So it's now a chloride anion.

95
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,100
It has grabbed this
orange electron.

96
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,674
   

97
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,779
Let me do it in orange.

98
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,190
It has grabbed this orange
electron, so it now has a

99
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,930
negative charge.

100
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,020
You can imagine that the
negative charge has been

101
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,970
transferred from the methoxide
to the chloride anion.

102
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,550
And now what's different this
time is that the double bond

103
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,760
is now between the one and the
two carbon and not between the

104
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,490
two and the three carbon.

105
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,550
So now it's going to
look like this.

106
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,160
So now, the result of this
product, if the reaction went

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,400
this way would look like this.

108
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,670
We have this carbon
right here.

109
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,920
It is bonded to two hydrogens.

110
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,840
   

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,520
Now, it has a double bond
with this carbon.

112
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,750
It has a double bond, and
I'll do the second bond.

113
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,290
I'll do the pi bond of the
double bond in purple right

114
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:01,910
over there.

115
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,440
I'll assume that that's
the pi bond.

116
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,080
That's the new double
bond form.

117
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,660
And now this carbon, which
was the alpha carbon,

118
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,410
is right over here.

119
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,530
This was the alpha carbon.

120
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,460
It's bonded to one hydrogen.

121
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,050
And then let me draw
everything else.

122
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,200
So then you have a
carbon, a carbon.

123
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,090
This guy is bonded to
three hydrogens.

124
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,280
I could have just written
it as CH3 if I wanted.

125
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,430
This guy's bonded to
two hydrogens.

126
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,290
And we're done.

127
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,140
So instead of, as we saw on
the first video on E2

128
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,300
reactions, instead of forming
but-2-ene, we now have-- it's

129
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,410
still one, two, three four
carbons, so it's still but-,

130
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,380
but the double bond is
on the one carbon.

131
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,060
We'd start one, two, three,
four, So we could call this

132
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,690
but-1-ene or 1-butene,
either way.

133
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,940
So let's call this but-1-ene.

134
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,300
   

135
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,100
So the question is, which is
more likely to happen?

136
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,940
Do both happen?

137
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,200
Does one happen
disproportionately?

138
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,180
And the answer is, is that,
yes, one happens

139
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,080
disproportionately.

140
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,320
This one, this is the
dominant product.

141
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,660
If you were to perform this
reaction and you were to

142
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,080
analyze in your beaker or
wherever you're performing the

143
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,780
reaction what you see most of,
the majority product, the

144
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,810
great majority, is
going to be the

145
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,130
but-2-ene, not the but-1-ene.

146
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,680
Maybe you see very, very
little of this.

147
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,030
And the question is why?

148
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,920
Or how would you even be
able to determine that?

149
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,710
Or how could you have
predicted that?

150
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,350
And to predict it,
there's something

151
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,710
called Zaitsev's rule.

152
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,490
And I'm sure I mispronouncing
it, but let me write it down.

153
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,080
So Zaitsev's rule.

154
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,010
And it's kind of analogous to
Markovnikov's rule, but for

155
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,080
elimination reactions.

156
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,980
If you think about it, the
addition reactions that we did

157
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,260
many videos ago are
the opposite of

158
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,340
the elimination reactions.

159
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,210
In the addition reactions, we're
adding the chloro group,

160
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,830
and in the elimination,
we're taking it off.

161
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,840
And so Zaitsev's rule is
kind of analogous to

162
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,920
Markovnikov's rule.

163
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,500
Now first, I'll just tell you
the rule, then we can think a

164
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,020
little bit about why it works.

165
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,910
The jury's not out on this.

166
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,350
They think they know
why it works, but

167
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,760
they're not 100% sure.

168
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,100
So Zaitsev's rules says the
carbon that is going to lose

169
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,020
the hydrogen is the one that
has fewer hydrogens.

170
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,600
So let me write it
down over here.

171
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:28,250
Carbon more likely to lose
hydrogen is-- I should say the

172
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,080
hydrogen proton because it keeps
the electron still-- is

173
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,240
the one with fewer hydrogens.

174
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,940
   

175
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,650
So if you were to look at this
reaction right here, we have

176
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,080
our alpha carbon.

177
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,300
Either this beta carbon or this
beta carbon could lose

178
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,030
its hydrogen.

179
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,050
This one has three
hydrogens on it.

180
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,140
This one only has two.

181
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,930
So Zaitsev's rule tells us that
this is the hydrogen, or

182
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,310
actually the proton, that
is more likely to be

183
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,760
reacted with the base.

184
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,430
You could almost view it as it
is the more acidic proton.

185
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,420
It is a lower-hanging
fruit for this

186
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,950
strong base to capture.

187
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,240
Now, a more interesting
question-- and that's a pretty

188
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,130
easy rule to follow.

189
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,280
And if they both have the same
number, then you'd see equal

190
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,450
products depending on
which side it gets.

191
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,510
Now the question is why
is this happening?

192
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,040
And here, something called

193
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,820
hyperconjugation comes into effect.

194
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,410
I'm not going to go into details
in it and to the

195
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,660
quantum mechanics of it.

196
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,289
   

197
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:41,940
And hyperconjugation is the
notion that the fact-- so we

198
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,550
said that the one with the fewer
hydrogens is the one

199
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,160
that's less likely to lose.

200
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,810
Or the one with fewer hydrogens
is the one more

201
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,990
likely to lose the
hydrogen proton.

202
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,830
But the one with fewer hydrogens
is also bonded to

203
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,120
more carbons.

204
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,900
This guy's bonded to
one carbon outside

205
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,690
of the alpha carbon.

206
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,360
He's actually bonded to two:
the alpha and this carbon.

207
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,920
This guy right here is only
bonded to the alpha carbon.

208
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,340
And hyperconjugation is the
notion that not the beta

209
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,160
carbon, but the carbons one over
from that help stabilize

210
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,220
the double bond that eventually
forms. I almost

211
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,550
think of it you have more
electrons over here because

212
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,760
carbons have more electrons
to offer than hydrogens.

213
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,970
At the end of the day, this
guy is more likely able to

214
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,120
donate electrons to form from
the right-hand side to make a

215
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,360
double bond than from
the left-hand side.

216
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,990
I won't go into the detail of
hyperconjugation, but it's all

217
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,390
based on the notion that the
more stable double bond will

218
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,730
be formed if we have other
carbons near the double bond.

219
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,860
Now, another way to
think about is

220
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,420
to look at the products.

221
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,460
So we saw or Zaitsev's rule
tells us that but-2-ene is a

222
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,130
more likely product
than but-1-ene.

223
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:58,640
And if you look at but-1-ene, we
could rewrite it like this.

224
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,960
We could draw the double
bond like this.

225
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,590
This carbon is what was
the alpha carbon.

226
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,360
We could draw a carbon
right here.

227
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,740
And then it is bonded
to a hydrogen.

228
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,390
It's bonded to this hydrogen.

229
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,830
And then it's bonded to just
a chain of carbons.

230
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,310
We'll just write R on that.

231
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,100
And then this guy is just
bonded to two hydrogens.

232
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,350
   

233
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,790
Well, this isn't necessarily
but-1-ene.

234
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,250
I just put an R here, but
this is how it could be

235
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,770
represented.

236
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,760
Now, the but-2-ene, if we wanted
to draw it like this

237
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,870
would look like this.

238
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,556
We could call this right
here R prime.

239
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,390
It's just a chain of carbons.

240
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:52,150
And then we could call
this R prime prime.

241
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,150
It's not even a chain.

242
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,040
It's just one carbon.

243
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,320
But if we call it that, then the
but-2-ene-- let me draw it

244
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,270
down here where I have
more real estate.

245
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,830
The but-2-ene would
look like this.

246
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,490
You have your carbon-carbon
double bond.

247
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,120
   

248
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,070
Now, the left-hand carbon is
bonded to a hydrogen, that

249
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,930
hydrogen right there,
and to R prime.

250
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,090
And the right-hand carbon
is bonded to

251
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,100
hydrogen and R prime prime.

252
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,470
So it's bonded to a hydrogen
and R prime prime.

253
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,830
All I did here-- let me see if
I can fit it all on the same

254
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,890
screen-- is I just redrew this
and I just abstracted away the

255
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,600
chain as it goes away from
the double bond.

256
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,500
And I did that so that we
can look at it this way.

257
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,200
We can just have the double bond
kind of as our focus of

258
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,230
attention and think about what's
going on around it.

259
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,750
Over here, for the but-1-ene,
and we already said this is

260
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,260
the lesser product, so this
is the greater product.

261
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,780
This is the greater, or
the dominant product.

262
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,180
In the lesser product, if we go
off of the double bond, we

263
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,330
only have one alkyl
group right there.

264
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,370
That R right here.

265
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,080
Over here, we have two.

266
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,390
And we say that this is
more substituted.

267
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,500
And when w say substituted,
you're imagining that you're

268
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,620
substituting hydrogens
with carbon

269
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,500
chains, with alkyl groups.

270
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,530
So this one right here
is more substituted.

271
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,230
   

272
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,760
And hyperconjugation, so the
idea would have it, is that

273
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,880
these carbon chains that are
near the double bond help

274
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,970
stabilize it.

275
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,280
Some of their sigma electrons
and sigma orbitals are there

276
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,800
to somehow help stabilize
the pi orbitals.

277
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,670
And now this is getting into
quantum mechanics and all of

278
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,770
that, so it's a little bit-- you
know, the world isn't 100%

279
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,710
clear whether that's definitely
the mechanism,

280
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,930
although people have run the
experiment, and they know that

281
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,910
the more substituted product
is what you're going to see

282
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,000
more of as opposed to the less
substituted, and that all

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,450
comes from Zaitsev's rule.

284
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,530
So, hopefully, you at least
get Zaitsev's rule.

285
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,900
The hyperconjugation, that's
kind of a deeper concept.

286
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,880
You know, the jury's
not even out on it.

287
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,380
That's a belief of why
Zaitsev's rule works.

288
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,470
But the rule itself is pretty
straightforward.

289
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,030
If you're trying to pick between
two beta carbons, the

290
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,280
one that's going to lose the
hydrogen is the one that

291
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,040
already has pure hydrogens
or the one that's

292
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,190
bonded to more carbons.

293
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,120
And this is true.

294
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,010
I drew it.

295
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,400
Everything we focused on right
now was in an E2 reaction.

296
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,160
But it's just as true
in an E1 reaction.

297
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,467
