What I want to do in this video is think about the difference between a line segment (a line segment)

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:17,020
a line (a line), and a ray (and a ray). And this is kind of the pure geometrical versions of these, of

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,314
these, things. And so a line segment is actually probably what most of us associate with a line in our

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:28,867
everyday lives. So a line segment is something just like that (for a lack of a better word) a straight

5
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:34,946
line, but why we call it a segment is that it actually has a starting and a stopping point. So most of

6
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:40,867
the lines we experience in our everyday reality are actually line segments when we think of it from a

7
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:44,745
pure geometrical point of view. And i know i drew a little bit of a curve here, but this is supposed

8
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:50,782
to be completely straight. But this is a line segment. The segment, the segment is based on the fact

9
00:00:50,782 --> 00:00:55,937
that it has an ending point and a starting point, or a starting point and an ending point. A line if

10
00:00:55,937 --> 00:01:03,133
you're thinking about it in the pure geometric sense of a line, is, essentially, it does not stop. It

11
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:08,615
doesn't have a starting point and an ending point. It keeps going on forever in both directions so a

12
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:15,867
line would look like this (a line, would look like this) and to show that it keeps on going on forever in

13
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:21,432
that direction right over there we draw this arrow, and to keep showing that it goes on forever in kind

14
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:27,609
of the down left direction, we draw this arrow right over here. So obviously, y-you no I've never encountered

15
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:33,971
something that just keeps on going straight forever (forever), but in math (thats the neat thing about math) we

16
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:39,637
can think about these abstract notions and so the mathematical purest geometric sense of a line is the

17
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:47,299
straight thing that goes on forever. Now a ray is something in between. A ray has a well defined starting

18
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:54,451
point (so that's its starting point), but then it just keeps on going on forever. So then, so the ray

19
00:01:54,451 --> 00:02:01,467
might start over here, but then it just keeps on going (then it just keeps on going). So that right over

20
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:07,361
there is a ray. Now that out of the way, let's actually try to do the Khan Academy module on recognizing

21
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:12,145
the difference between line segments, lines and rays. And i think you'll find it pretty straight forward

22
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:17,467
based on, on our little classification right over here. So let me get the module, let me get the module

23
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:26,030
going. (let me, where did i put it? where did i put it? there you go!) Alright, so what is this thing

24
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,789
right over here? Well it has two arrows on both ends, so it's implying that it goes on forever. So this

25
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:37,780
is going to be a line. (lets check our answer.) Yeah! Its a line. (now it's taking some time, oh correct,

26
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,027
next question) Alright now what about this thing? Wait once again arrows on both sides means that this

27
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:49,622
thing is going to go on forever in both directions, so once again it is a line. Fair enough, lets do

28
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:55,427
another one. Here, we have one arrow, so it goes on forever in this direction, but it has a well defined

29
00:02:55,427 --> 00:03:00,721
starting point. So it starts there and then goes on forever. And if you remember that's what a ray is.

30
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:07,037
One staring point but goes on forever. So it goes, or more when you think about it, it goes on forever

31
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:13,200
in only one direction. So that is a ray. So lets do another question. This right over here, you have

32
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,114
a starting point and an ending point. Or u can call this the start point and the ending point but it

33
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:24,777
doesn't go on forever in either direction. so this right over here, is a line segment. (there you go)

34
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:30,953
So hopefully that, that gives you enough t-t-to work your way through this module. And you might notice that

35
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:35,319
when i did this (when i did this) module right here, there is no video and that's exactly what this video

36
00:03:35,319 --> 99:59:59,999
is, it's the video for this module.
