1
00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:05,536
A squirrel is running across the road at 12 feet/s

2
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:10,269
It needs to run 9 feet to get across the road.

3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:14,200
How long will it take the squirrel to run 9 feet?

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,537
Round to the nearest 100th of a second. Fair enough.

5
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:20,802
A car is 50 feet away from the squirrel.

6
00:00:20,802 --> 00:00:22,742
Okay, this is a high stakes word problem.

7
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:27,034
Driving toward it at a speed of 100 feet/s

8
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:30,367
How long will it take for the car to drive 50 feet?

9
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:32,736
Round to the nearest 100th of a second.

10
00:00:32,736 --> 00:00:38,282
Will the squirrel make it 9 feet across the road before the car gets there?

11
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:41,338
So this is definitely high stakes, at least for the squirrel.

12
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:43,270
So let's answer the first question.

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,937
Let's figure out how long will it take the squirrel to run 9 feet.

14
00:00:47,937 --> 00:00:49,618
So, let's think about it.

15
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:53,666
The squirrel...let me write squirrel, squirrel right over here...

16
00:00:53,666 --> 00:01:02,281
the squirrel, so the squirrel's got to go 9 feet and we want to figure out many seconds it's going to take

17
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:05,458
So, what would we...would we divide or multiply this?

18
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,201
by 12?

19
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,071
Well, to think about that, you could think about the units

20
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,958
where we want to get an answer in terms of seconds

21
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,069
we want to figure out time

22
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:22,202
So, it would be great if we could multiply this...times seconds...seconds per foot

23
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:24,951
then the feet will cancel out and I'll be left with seconds

24
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:32,803
Now, right over here, we're told that squirrel can run at 12 feet per second, but we want seconds per foot

25
00:01:32,803 --> 00:01:36,670
so, the squirrel every second, so they go 12 feet/s

26
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,804
Then we could also say 1 second per every 12 feet

27
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:42,205
So, let's it write it that way

28
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:45,869
So, it's essentially the reciprocal of this because the units are the reciprocal of this

29
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:51,067
So, it's 1 second for every 12 feet

30
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:54,455
Notice, all I did was take this information right over here, 12 feet/s

31
00:01:54,455 --> 00:02:00,542
and I wrote it as second per foot, 12 feet for every 1 second, 1 second for every 12 feet

32
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:06,375
What's useful about this is, this will now give me the time it takes for the squirrel in seconds

33
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,292
So, the feet cancel out with the feet

34
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:16,409
and I am left with 9 x 1/12, which is 9/12 seconds

35
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,804
and 9/12 seconds is the same thing as 3/4 seconds

36
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:27,531
which is the same thing as 0.75 seconds for the squirrel to cross the street

37
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:30,069
Now, let's think about the car

38
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,072
So, now let's think about the car.

39
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:33,878
And it's the exact same logic.

40
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:35,873
They tell us that the car is 50 feet away

41
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:41,140
So, the squirrel's trying to cross the road, like that

42
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,541
And the car is 50ft away coming in like that

43
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,072
and we want to figure if the squirrel will survive

44
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:49,875
So, the car is 50 feet away

45
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,807
So, it's 50 feet away

46
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:56,074
We want to figure out the time it'll take to travel at 50 feet

47
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:58,407
Once again, we would want it in seconds

48
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:00,135
so we would want seconds per feet

49
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:05,620
So, we would want to multiply by seconds per foot

50
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,805
seconds per foot

51
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:10,709
They give us the speed in feet per second

52
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,738
100 feet / s

53
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:19,140
And so we just have to realize that this is 100 feet for every 1 second

54
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,204
or 1/100th seconds per feet

55
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:27,535
this is once again just this information, this information, but we took the reciprocal of it

56
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:30,137
cause we don't want feet per second, we want seconds per feet

57
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:33,210
and if we do that, that cancels with that

58
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,534
and we're left with 50 over 100 seconds

59
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:41,689
So, this is 50 over 100 is 0.50 seconds

60
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:46,784
And so now, let's answer the question, this life and death situation for the squirrel

61
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:52,470
Will the squirrel make it 9 feet across the road before the car gets there

62
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,942
Well, it's going to take the squirrel 0.75 seconds to cross

63
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:59,806
and it's going to take the car only half a second

64
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:06,425
So, the car is going to get to where the squirrel is crossing before the squirrel has the chance to get all the way across the road

65
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:10,425
So, unfortunately for the squirrel, the answer is...no...
