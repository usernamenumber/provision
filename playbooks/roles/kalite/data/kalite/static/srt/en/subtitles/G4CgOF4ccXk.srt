1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,010
Everything we've done so far has
been stationary fluids, or

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,440
static fluids, and we've been
dealing with static pressure.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,760
We were trying to figure out
what happens when everything's

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,770
in a steady state.

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,460
Now let's work on what
happens when the

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,860
fluid is actually moving.

8
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,260
Let's imagine a pipe.

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,530
   

10
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,500
Let's say one end of the pipe
has a larger area than the

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,260
other end, or at least
a different area.

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,690
   

13
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,830
So this is one end of the pipe,
and this is the other

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,080
end of a pipe.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,480
   

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,600
It's filled with some fluid,
some liquid, actually, in our

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,550
example, so there's just a bunch
of liquid in this fluid.

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,910
   

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,980
Let's say this area
at the entrance is

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,620
called the area in.

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:05,349
That's the area of the opening
into the pipe, and let's call

22
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,540
this area out.

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,100
It's the area of the opening
coming out of the pipe.

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,090
Let's think about what
happens if this

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,200
liquid is actually moving.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,230
Let's say it's moving into the
pipe with the velocity V in.

27
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,770
   

28
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,920
Let's think about how much
volume moves into the pipe

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,430
after T seconds.

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,540
After T seconds, if you
think about it, you'd

31
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,490
have this much area.

32
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,210
If you think about what was
right here, it will then be

33
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,130
moved to the right
by how much?

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,580
   

35
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,820
We could just go back to our
basic kinematic formula:

36
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,420
distance is equal to
rate times time.

37
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,150
The distance something travels
equals velocity times time, so

38
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:07,000
after T seconds, whatever fluid
was here, it would have

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,479
an area of about that much.

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,800
Whatever fluid was there
would have traveled

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,520
how much to the right?

42
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,660
It would have traveled-- let's
assume that the pipe doesn't

43
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,670
change too much in diameter or
in radius from here to here.

44
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:28,046
It would have traveled velocity
times time, so V in

45
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,240
times time.

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,920
It could be meters or whatever
our length units are.

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,870
After T seconds, essentially
this much water has traveled

48
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,690
into the pipe.

49
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,870
You could imagine a cylinder
of water here.

50
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,650
Once again, I know I made it
look like it's getting wider

51
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,610
the whole time, but let's assume
that its width doesn't

52
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,800
change that much over the T
seconds or whatever units of

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,840
time we're looking at.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,640
What is the volume of this
cylinder of water?

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:08,280
The volume-in over the T seconds
is equal to the area,

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,610
or the left-hand side
of the cylinder.

57
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,990
Let me draw the cylinder in a
more vibrant color so you can

58
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,240
figure out the volume.

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,526
   

60
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:26,740
So it equals this side, the left
side of the cylinder, the

61
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,040
input area times the length
of the cylinder.

62
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,510
That's the velocity of the
fluid times the time that

63
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:40,690
we're measuring, times the input
velocity times time.

64
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,120
That's the amount of volume
that came in.

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,270
If that volume came into the
pipe-- once again, we learned

66
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,050
several videos ago that the
definition of a liquid is a

67
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,640
fluid that's incompressible.

68
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,900
It's not like no fluid could
come out of the pipe and all

69
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,020
of the fluid just
gets squeezed.

70
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,560
The same volume of fluid would
have to come out of the pipe,

71
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,680
so that must equal
the volume out.

72
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,230
   

73
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,950
Whatever comes into the pipe has
to equal the volume coming

74
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,810
out of the pipe.

75
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,290
One assumption we're assuming in
this fraction of time that

76
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,160
we're dealing with is also that
there's no friction in

77
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,770
this liquid or in this fluid,
that it actually is not

78
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,480
turbulent and it's
not viscous.

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,870
A viscous fluid is really just
something that has a lot of

80
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,340
friction with itself and that
it won't just naturally move

81
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,970
without any resistance.

82
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,390
When something is not viscous
and has no resistance with

83
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,670
itself and moves really without
any turbulence, that's

84
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,950
called laminar flow.

85
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,800
That's just a good word to
know about and it's the

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,210
opposite of viscous flow.

87
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,990
Different things have different
viscosities, and

88
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,260
we'll probably do
more on that.

89
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,870
Like syrup or peanut
butter has a

90
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,350
very, very high viscosity.

91
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,290
Even glass actually
is a fluid with a

92
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,725
very, very high viscosity.

93
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:05,450
   

94
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,470
I think there's some kinds of
compounds and magnetic fields

95
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,300
that you could create that have
perfect laminar flow, but

96
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,970
this is kind of a perfect
situation.

97
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,330
In these circumstances, the
volume in, because the fluid

98
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,040
can't be compressed, it's
incompressible, has to equal

99
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,920
the volume out.

100
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,160
What's the volume out over
that period of time?

101
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,040
Similarly, we could draw this
bigger cylinder-- that's the

102
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,930
area out-- and after
T seconds, how much

103
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,390
water has come out?

104
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,700
Whatever water was here at the
beginning of our time period

105
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:50,570
will have come out and we can
imagine the cylinder here.

106
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:56,130
What is the width
of the cylinder?

107
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,840
What's going to be the velocity
that the liquid is

108
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,570
coming out on the
right-hand side?

109
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,260
   

110
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,590
Capital V is volume, and
lowercase v is for velocity,

111
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,240
so it's going to be the output
velocity-- that's a lowercase

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,640
v-- times the same time.

113
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,440
   

114
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,580
So what is the volume that has
come out in our time T?

115
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,160
It's just going to be this area
times this width, so the

116
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,030
output volume over that same
period of time is equal to the

117
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,570
output area of this pipe
times the output

118
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,410
velocity times time.

119
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,650
Once again, I know I keep saying
this, but this is kind

120
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,020
of the big ah-hah moment, is
in that amount of time, the

121
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,160
volume in this cylinder
has to equal the

122
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,190
volume in this cylinder.

123
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,490
Maybe it's not as wide, or
something like that, but their

124
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,220
volumes are the same.

125
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,610
You can't get more water here
all of a sudden than what's

126
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,510
going in, and likewise, you
can't put more water into the

127
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,370
left side than what's coming out
of the right side, because

128
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,860
it's incompressible

129
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:07,190
These two volumes equal each
other, so we know the area of

130
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,030
the opening onto to the left
hand of the pipe times the

131
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:16,160
input velocity times the
duration of time we're talking

132
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,450
about is equal to the output
area times the output velocity

133
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,830
times the duration of time
we're talking about.

134
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,680
   

135
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,000
It's the same time on both sides
of this equation, so we

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,250
could say that the input area
times the input velocity is

137
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,570
equal to the output area times
the output velocity.

138
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:48,040
This is actually called in fluid
motion the equation of

139
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,370
continuity, and it leads to
some interesting things.

140
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,300
We'll do some problems
with it in a second.

141
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,560
One thing that I want to
introduce at this point as

142
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,670
well is what is the
volume per second?

143
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,000
Because this is also something
we're going to deal with in a

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,390
second, probably in the next
video, because I'm about to

145
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,590
run out of time.

146
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,630
We said that in T seconds we
have this amount of volume

147
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,420
coming in and it's the same
coming in as coming out.

148
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,040
So what is the volume
per second?

149
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,060
It's this big capital Vi
per amount of time, and

150
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,220
we call that flux.

151
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,430
We'll learn a lot about flux,
especially when we start doing

152
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,870
vector calculus, but flux is
just how much of something

153
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,900
crosses a surface in
an amount of time.

154
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,930
It's how much a volume
crosses a surface in

155
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,640
an amount of time.

156
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,890
So in this case, the
surface is the

157
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,840
left-hand side of cylinder.

158
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,020
And we're saying how much
crosses in amount of time?

159
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,830
We figured out it's that input
volume, which crosses in every

160
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,820
T seconds, and this
is called flux.

161
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,930
   

162
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,650
You've probably heard of the
flux capacitor in Back To The

163
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,040
Future, and maybe we can think
about what they were

164
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,320
trying to hint at.

165
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,970
Let's see if we can use flux
and these ideas to come up

166
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,965
with some other interesting
equations.

167
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:08,360
   

168
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,290
We know that the volume per
time is equal to flux.

169
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,180
This is a big V.

170
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,700
V is equal to flux, and actually
the variable people

171
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,760
generally use for flux is R.

172
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,640
Of course, it's in meters
cubed per second.

173
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
That's its unit.

174
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:33,480
We also know that the input area
times input velocity--

175
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,820
that's a lowercase v-- is equal
to the output area times

176
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,810
output velocity, and this is
called the equation of

177
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,810
continuity.

178
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,150
It holds true whenever
we have laminar flow.

179
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,230
Actually, I'm about to
run out of time.

180
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,330
In the next video, I'm actually
going to use some of

181
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,580
this information to figure out
how much power is there in a

182
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,150
system where we have fluid
going through a pipe.

183
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,600
See you soon.

184
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:58,900
