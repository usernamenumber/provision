1
00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:04,734
We're told to list in order from smallest to largest.

2
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:06,666
So each of these quantities,

3
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:09,751
it looks like we have expressions inside of absolute value signs.

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:11,483
and just as a bit of review,

5
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:14,240
absolute value just means your distance from zero.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,850
Or, another way to think about it is

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,750
if it's a negative number inside of the absolute value sign,

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,135
it becomes positive.

9
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:22,433
If it's already positive, it stays positive.

10
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:24,166
So let's think about these numbers.

11
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:29,384
So the first one is the absolute value of 5.

12
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:32,041
How far is 5 away from zero?

13
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:36,128
5 away from zero. So it's equal to five.

14
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,580
So if I were to actually draw a number line,

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,190
you would see that.

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,537
0 is here, 5 is over here.

17
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:43,700
This distance right there is five.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,503
So the absolute value of 5 is 5.

19
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:50,662
Now, the next quantity they want us to figure out is

20
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:55,566
the absolute value of... absolute value of 9 minus 7.

21
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:58,900
Well, this is the same thing as the absolute of 2.

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,583
9 minus 7 is 2.

23
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:04,468
And once again, 2 is just 2 units away from 0.

24
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:05,949
So it's just 2.

25
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:07,866
If you have a positive value in the absolute value sign,

26
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:09,485
it just is itself.

27
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:12,119
The absolute value of 2 is 2.

28
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,163
Then, we have the absolute value of 5 minus 15.

29
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:21,771
Absolute value of 5 minus 15.

30
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:25,302
Well that's going to be the same thing as 5 minus 15 is negative 10.

31
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:29,001
So it's the same thing as the absolute value of negative 10.

32
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,400
Now, there's two ways you can think about it.

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,749
If it's a negative number inside of the absolute value sign,

34
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:36,017
it just becomes the positive version of it.

35
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:37,391
So it just becomes 10.

36
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,768
Another way to think about it is, if you had negative 10,

37
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:42,494
You would plot it out here some place, negative 10.

38
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:44,246
We would have to extend the number line.

39
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:46,464
It is 10 to the left of 0.

40
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:49,113
That's what the absolute value is telling us.

41
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:55,733
Then we have the absolute value of zero.

42
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,985
Well zero is just zero away from the number line.

43
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,842
The absolute value of zero is just zero.

44
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:03,415
That is just zero, that is just right there.

45
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,042
It has no distance from the origin.

46
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:13,003
And then finally, we have the absolute value of negative 3.

47
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:15,267
That's 3 to the left of 0.

48
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:17,691
or you can just think of it as getting rid of the negative sign

49
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:20,226
So it is equal to 3

50
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:24,180
So, now that we've expressed them all as just simple integers.

51
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,200
let's list them in order from smallest to largest.

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
So, of all of these values, which is the smallest?

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,321
This one is the smallest.

54
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:33,418
The absolute value of zero.

55
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:36,550
So, let me write that down, the absolute value of zero.

56
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,635
What's the next smallest?

57
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,841
We have a 2 there. This is the next smallest.

58
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:43,770
Right there.

59
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,531
That original expression was the absolute value of 9 minus 7.

60
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:51,350
So the absolute value of 9 minus 7.

61
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,516
And then what's the next smallest?

62
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:54,834
We have this 3, and then a 5 and a 10.

63
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:59,527
So the next smallest is this 3 right here.

64
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:05,399
and that original expression was the absolute value of negative 3.

65
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:08,002
And then we have this 5 over here.

66
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:11,029
which is just the absolute value of 5.

67
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:13,603
And then finally we have this 10 over here.

68
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:19,800
which was the absolute value of 5 minus 15.

69
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,000
And we are done.
