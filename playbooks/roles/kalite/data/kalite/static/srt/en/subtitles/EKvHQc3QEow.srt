1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:04,797
This is a picture of Isaac Newton super famous British mathematician

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:10,036
and physicist and this is the picture of Gottfried Leibniz super famous

3
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:13,768
but maybe not as famous but maybe should be famous german

4
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:17,017
philosopher and mathematician, he was a contemprary of Isaac Newton

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,485
These two gentlemen together were really the founding

6
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:24,900
fathers of the calculus and they did some of their, most of their

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,334
major work in the late 1600's and

8
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:29,317
this right over here is Usain Bolt

9
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:33,085
Jamaican sprinter who's continuing to do some of his best work

10
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:38,267
in 2012 and as early of 2012, he is the fastest human alive

11
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:41,550
he would probably be the fastest human that has ever lived

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,418
and you might not have made the association with these three

13
00:00:45,418 --> 00:00:48,252
gentlemen.Might not think they have lot in common but they

14
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:52,201
were all obsessed with same fundamental question that differantial

15
00:00:52,201 --> 00:01:00,335
calculus addresses and the question is what is the instantaneous rate

16
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:04,351
of change of something. In the case of Usain Bolt how fast is he going

17
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:09,135
right now? Not just his average speed was for last second or his average

18
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:13,334
speed in his next 10 seconds. How fast is he going right now?

19
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:18,801
So this is what differential calculus is all about. Instantaneous rates of change

20
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:26,517
differential calculus and Newton's term for differential calculus

21
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:30,619
was the method of flexions which actually sound something fancier

22
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:37,952
but its all about what's happening in this instant in this instant and to think about that

23
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:41,702
why it not a super easy problem to address with the traditional

24
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:48,150
algebra, lets draw a little graph here. So on this axis on this axis I have distance

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:54,885
so now say y is equal to distance. I could have said d=distance we will see later

26
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:58,819
in calculus d is reserved for something else.we will say y=distance

27
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:04,767
and in this axis we will say time and i can say t=time but rather say x=time

28
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:10,902
x=time, so if we had to plot Usain Bolt's distance as a function of time

29
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:16,886
well in time 0 he hasn't gone anywhere he's right over there and we know at this

30
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:23,335
gentleman is capable of travelling a 100 metres in 9.58 seconds

31
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:27,819
so after 9.58 seconds we'll assume that this is in seconds over here, he is

32
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,736
capable of going 100 metres. 100 metres.

33
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:36,401
and so using this information we can actually figure out his average speed

34
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:44,351
his average speed right this way his average speed is just going to be change in distance

35
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:48,802
over his change in time

36
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:56,186
and using the variable over here we are saying y is distance and this is change in y over

37
00:02:56,186 --> 00:03:01,619
change in x from this point to that point and this might look somewhat familiar to you

38
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:07,152
from basic algebra.This is the slope between two points. If I have a line that connects these two points

39
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:13,186
and if i have a line that connects two points this is the slope of that line.

40
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:21,935
the change in distance is right over here.Change in y=100 m and our change in time is this right over

41
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:30,751
here so our change in time is equal to 9.58 seconds we start with 0, we goto 9.58 seconds another way

42
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:33,101
to think about it - the rise over the run

43
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,752
you might have heard in your algebra class.

44
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:37,586
It's going to be a 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.

45
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:42,053
So this is 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.

46
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:45,787
And the slope is essentially just the rate of change,

47
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:47,752
or you can view it as the average rate of change,

48
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:51,069
between these two points. And you'll see if you even follow

49
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,436
the units it gives you units of speed here.

50
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:56,980
It'd be velocity if we also specified the direction.

51
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,803
And we can figure out what that is. Let me get a calculator out.

52
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:07,137
Let me, so let me ... get the calculator on the screen.

53
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:14,454
So we're going 100 meters in 9.58 seconds so it's around 10.4

54
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:22,087
approximately 10.4 and then the units are meters per second.

55
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:28,270
And that is his average speed. And what we're gonna see in a second is

56
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,919
how average speed is different than instantaneous speed.

57
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,121
How it's different that the speed that he might be going in any

58
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:38,570
given moment. And just to have a concept of how fast this is

59
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,636
let me get the calculator back. This is in meters per second.

60
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:43,802
If you want to know how many meters he's going in an hour

61
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:45,653
there's thirty-six hundred seconds in an hour.

62
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:50,953
So he'll be able to go this many meters thirty-six hundred times.

63
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:54,603
So that's how many meters he can, if he were able to somehow

64
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:57,503
keep up that speed in an hour, this is how fast he is going

65
00:04:57,503 --> 00:05:00,715
in meters per hour. And then if you were to say how many miles

66
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:03,719
per hour, there's roughly 16 hundred, and I don't know the exact number

67
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:06,954
but roughly 16 hundred meters per mile so let's divide it

68
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:10,986
by 1600. And so you see that this is roughly a little over 23

69
00:05:10,986 --> 00:05:14,069
about 23 and 1/2 miles per hour. This is approximately ...

70
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:26,803
Let me write it this way, this is approximately 23.5 mph.

71
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:28,337
Let me scroll over.

72
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:29,738
Miles per hour.

73
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:31,719
And relative to a car not so fast but

74
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:34,586
relative to me extremely fast. Now, to see

75
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:38,525
how this is different than instantaneous velocity,

76
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:42,253
Let´s think about the potential plot of his distance relative to time

77
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:44,921
He is not going to just go the speed immediately.

78
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:46,538
He is not just gonna go as soon as the gun

79
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,656
fires. He is not just gonna go 23 and 1/2 mph.

80
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:51,402
All the way. He is going to have to accelerate.

81
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:54,204
So at first, he starts off going a little bit slower.

82
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:56,788
His slope is going to be a little bit lower.

83
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:58,919
Than the average slope. He is going to be little bit slower.

84
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,404
Then he is going to start accelerating. And so his

85
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:05,038
speed and you see this slope here is getting steeper and steeper and steeper

86
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,220
and then maybe near the end he starts tiring off a little bit.

87
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,486
And so his distance part against time might be a curve

88
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:14,337
that looks something like this.

89
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:16,978
And what we calculated here is just the average slope across

90
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:21,570
this change in time. We can see in any given moment

91
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,470
the slope is actualy different.

92
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,903
In the beginning he has a slower rate of change of

93
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:30,487
distance. Then over here he accelerates,

94
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:33,621
over here it seems like his rate of change of distance would be

95
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:34,670
roughly -- or you could view it

96
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,754
as a slope of the tangent line at that point --

97
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:38,838
it looks higher than his average.

98
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:40,671
And then he starts to slow down again.

99
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:43,887
?? ... Average goes to 23.5 miles per hour.

100
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:46,954
And I looked it up Usain Bolt´s instantaneous velocity

101
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:48,637
his peak instantaneous velocity

102
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:51,337
is actually close to 30 miles per hour.

103
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:53,220
So the slope over here might be

104
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,053
23... whatever miles per hour,

105
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:57,620
but instantaneous, his fastest poin in this

106
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,138
9.58 seconds is closer to 30 miles per hour.

107
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:04,020
But you see it is not a trivial thing to do.

108
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,771
You could say: OK, let me try to approximate

109
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:07,988
the slope right over here and you

110
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:09,269
could do that by saying : OK,

111
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:11,003
well, what is the change in "y"

112
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:13,138
over the change of "x" right around this.

113
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:18,353
You could say: Let me take some change of x,

114
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:21,020
and figure out what the change of y is around it.

115
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,470
Or as we go past that. So we get that. But that would just be an approximation.

116
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,404
Because you see that the slope of this curve is constantly changing.

117
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:33,354
So what you want to do is see what happens as the change of x gets smaller and smaller.

118
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:35,937
As the change of x gets smaller and smaller and smaller

119
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:37,754
we are going to get better and better approximation.

120
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:40,538
Your change in y is going to get smaller and smaller and smaller.

121
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:43,321
So what you wanna do and we are going to get into depth of all of this

122
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:44,821
and study it more rigorously,

123
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:50,304
you want to take the limit as delta x aproaches zero.

124
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,289
As delta x aproaches zero of

125
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:57,554
change in y over your change in x

126
00:07:57,554 --> 00:08:00,489
and when you do that you are going to

127
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:03,238
approach that instantaneous rate of change

128
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:06,071
you could view it as instantaneous slope at that point of the curve.

129
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:08,837
Or the slope of the tangent line at that point of the curve.

130
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:12,519
Or if we use calculus terminology we would view it as the derivative.

131
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:17,304
So the instantaneous slope is the derivative.

132
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:20,421
And the notation we use for derivative is dy

133
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:23,421
over dx. And that is why I reserved the letter y.

134
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:28,137
How does this relate to word "differential"?

135
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:32,466
This dy is differential.

136
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:36,003
dx is a differential. And one way to conceptualize this. This is an

137
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:40,123
infinitely small change in y, over an infinitely small change in x.

138
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:43,820
And by getting super, super small changes in y or changes in x

139
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,038
you are able to get this instantaneous slope

140
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:47,654
or in the case of this example

141
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:53,188
the instantaneous speed of Usain Bolt right at that moment.

142
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:55,455
And notice, you can not just put zero hero.

143
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:58,821
If we just put here change in x is 0 you are going to get something undefined.

144
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:01,472
You can not divide by zeros. You take the limit.

145
00:09:01,472 --> 99:59:59,999
As it approaches zero and we will define that more rigorously in the next few videos.
