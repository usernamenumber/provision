1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,690
So if you've gotten this far,
you've been waiting for

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,730
several videos to get to the
optimal line that minimizes

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,500
the squared distance to
all of those points.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,930
So let's just get to
the punch line.

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,240
Let's solve for the
optimal m and b.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,190
And just based on what we did
in the last videos, there's

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:16,850
two ways to do that.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,180
We actually now know two points
that lie on that line.

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,780
So we can literally find the
slope of that line and then

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,700
the the y intercept,
the b there.

12
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,230
Or, we could just say
it's the solution to

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,200
this system of equations.

14
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,140
And they're actually
mathematically equivalent.

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,230
So let's solve for m first. And
if we want to solve for m,

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,830
we want to cancel out the b's.

17
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,810
So let me rewrite this top
equation just the way it's

18
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,440
written over here.

19
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,690
We have m times the mean of the
x squareds plus b times

20
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,570
the mean of-- Actually,
we could even do

21
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,160
it better than that.

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,990
One step better than that is to,
based on the work we did

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,860
in the last video, we can just
subtract this bottom equation

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,530
from this top equation.

25
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,570
So let me subtract it.

26
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,590
Or let's add the negatives.

27
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,030
So if I make this negative,
this is negative.

28
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,060
This is negative.

29
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,980
What do we get?

30
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:12,630
We get m times the mean of the
x's minus the mean of the x

31
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,730
squareds over the mean of x.

32
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,270
   

33
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,760
The plus b and the negative
b cancel out.

34
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,960
Is equal to the mean of the y's
minus the mean of the xy's

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,780
over the mean of the x's.

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,860
And then, we can divide both
sides of the equation by this.

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:43,620
And so we get m is equal to the
mean of the y's minus the

38
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,720
mean of the xy's over the mean
of the x's over this.

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,600
The mean of the x's minus the
mean of the x squareds over

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,150
the mean of the x's.

41
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,220
Now notice, this is the exact
same thing that you would get

42
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,760
if you found the slope between
these two points over here.

43
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,380
Change in y, so the difference
between that y and that y, is

44
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,640
that right over there.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,030
Over the change in x's.

46
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,660
The change in that
x minus that x is

47
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,160
exactly this over here.

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,550
Now, to simplify it, we can
multiply both the numerator

49
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,620
and the denominator by
the mean of the x's.

50
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,370
And I do that just so we don't
have this in the denominator

51
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,580
both places.

52
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,840
So if we multiply the numerator
by the mean of the

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,030
x's, we get the mean of the x's
times the mean of the y's

54
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,280
minus, this and this will
cancel out, minus

55
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,040
the mean of the xy's.

56
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,410
   

57
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,400
All of that over, mean of the
x's times the mean of the x's

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:52,170
is just going to be the mean of
the x's squared, minus over

59
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,290
here you have the mean
of the x squared.

60
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,010
And that's what we get for m.

61
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,890
And if we want to solve for
b, we literally can just

62
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,990
substitute back into either
equation, but this equation

63
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,790
right here is simpler.

64
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,115
And so if we wanted to solve for
b there, we can solve for

65
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:17,510
b in terms of m.

66
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,910
We just subtract m times the
mean of x's from both sides.

67
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:30,320
We get b is equal to the mean
of the y's minus m times the

68
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,730
mean of the x's.

69
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,860
So what you do is you take
your data point.

70
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,440
You find the mean of the x's,
the mean of the y's , the mean

71
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,370
of the xy's, the mean
of the x's squared.

72
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,730
You find your m.

73
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,520
Once you find your m, then you
can substitute back in here

74
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,790
and you find your b.

75
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,130
And then you have your
actual optimal line.

76
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,800
And we're done.

77
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,100
So these are the two big formula
take aways for our

78
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,690
optimal line.

79
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,130
What I'm going to do in the next
video, and this is where

80
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,730
if anyone wasn't skipping up to
this point, the next video

81
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,360
is where they should re-engage,
because we're

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,420
actually going to use these
formulas for the

83
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,440
best fitting line.

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,440
At least, when you measure the
error by the squared distances

85
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,620
from the points.

86
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,930
We're going to use these
formulas to actually find the

87
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,780
best line for some data.

88
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,467
