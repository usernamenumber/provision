1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
   

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,730
I've got a matrix A, and
it's an m by n matrix.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,250
It has m rows and n columns.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,220
So I can write it in fairly
general terms like this.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,560
The first row would be a11.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,350
First row, first column.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,120
a12, First row, second column.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,100
All the way to-- I
have n columns.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,450
So a1n, first row,
n-th column.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,640
And then the second row
would look like this.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,540
a second row, first column.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,530
A second row, second column.

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,190
All the way to a second
row, n column.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,060
And we'll just keep doing that
all the way down until you get

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,890
to the m-th row.

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,500
The m row would look
like this.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,780
Each of these are the entries
in each of the rows or

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,400
columns, depending on how
you want to look at it.

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,160
So this is going to
be a sub m 1.

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,740
mth row, first column.

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,110
a sub m 2.

22
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,950
And you go all the
way to a sub m n.

23
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,590
This is our matrix right here.

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,500
That is my matrix A.

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:24,600
Now, I'm going to define the
transpose of this matrix as A

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,740
with this superscript T.

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,880
And this is going to be my
definition, it is essentially

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,930
the matrix A with all the rows
and the columns swapped.

29
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,220
So my matrix A transpose is
going to be a n by m matrix.

30
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,560
Notice I said m rows
and n columns.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,440
Now this is going to have
n rows and m columns.

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,940
So what is this guy going
to look like?

33
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,140
What is he going to look like?

34
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,670
Well I'm gonna swap my
rows and my columns.

35
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,440
So my first row becomes
my first column.

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,470
So I'm going to have a11.

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,680
That entry's still going
to be in that position.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,510
But now this entry is not
going to be right here.

39
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,250
a12.

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,289
And my second row I have what
I used to have in my second

41
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,560
row, first column.

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm now going to have what
I had in my second

43
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,630
column, first row.

44
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,410
I'm just going to go down
all the way to a1n.

45
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,150
And that makes--
not a i n, a1n.

46
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,120
And that makes sense because
I'll now have n columns.

47
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,780
Sorry I now have n rows.

48
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,130
I had n columns before.

49
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,620
Now I have n rows.

50
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,540
Now this row, when I transpose
it is going look like this.

51
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,510
a21, a22, all the
way down to a2n.

52
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,370
It might be a little confusing
for you right now to have this

53
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,590
notation right there because
everything we've done so far.

54
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,250
We've always said, hey this
first number's the row and the

55
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,620
second number is the column.

56
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,380
That's what we did up here.

57
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,170
What I'm doing here, you can
ignore that reference to the

58
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,930
rows and columns.

59
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,490
You can just say whatever we
had here in my first row,

60
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,730
second column, I
now have here.

61
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,370
When you look at this transpose,
don't take these

62
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,800
subscripts too literally.

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
Or now you can kind of reverse
your interpretation.

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,670
This is now the first
column, second row.

65
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,625
This was the second
row, first column.

66
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,340
   

67
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,900
I don't want you get too
confused with these

68
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,820
subscripts.

69
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,370
Just keep in mind, we're
taking all the rows and

70
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,120
turning them into the columns
to get the transpose.

71
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,920
And then you just
keep doing this.

72
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,110
And then this m-th row will now
become the m-th column.

73
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,780
am1, am2, all the way
down to a m n.

74
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,880
   

75
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,030
So, this entry is
now that entry.

76
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,890
If you know, this entry
is now that entry.

77
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,890
That entry is now
at that entry.

78
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,330
I think you get the idea.

79
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,870
This is what A transpose is.

80
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,350
And sometimes when you do in
the abstract, it can be a

81
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,140
little confusing.

82
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,420
And we'll especially appreciate
that once we do

83
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,650
some of the proofs involving
the transpose.

84
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,390
But actually taking the
transpose of an actual matrix,

85
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,990
with actual numbers, shouldn't
be too difficult.

86
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,290
So, let's start with
the 2 by 2 case.

87
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,720
I'll try to color code
it as best as I can.

88
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,380
So let's say I have
the matrix.

89
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,790
Let's say I defined A.

90
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,760
Let's do B now.

91
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,250
I already defined A.

92
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,110
Let's say B.

93
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:33,510
B is equal to the matrix
1, 2, 3, 4.

94
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,150
Those colors are pretty close.

95
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,430
But what is B transpose
going to look like?

96
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,800
B transpose is going to be equal
to-- You switch the rows

97
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,370
and columns.

98
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,510
So the first row will now
become the first column.

99
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,590
1, 2.

100
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,200
And the second row will
now become the

101
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,300
second column, 3, 4.

102
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,770
Or you could view it
the other way.

103
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,200
The first column now became
the first row.

104
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,110
And the second column now
became the second row.

105
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,970
Let's do an example.

106
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,400
Instead of even doing a 2 by
3-- or a 3 by 3-- let me do

107
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,910
one that might be a little
bit more challenging.

108
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,340
I think this'll make
things clear.

109
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,055
So let's say I have
the matrix C.

110
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:14,130
   

111
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,890
Let me make it a pretty
big matrix.

112
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,540
Let's say it is a 4 by
3 matrix right here.

113
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,120
Let me just throw some
numbers in there.

114
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,060
1, 0, minus 1.

115
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,660
2, 7.

116
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,250
Oh I want to do it in
different colors.

117
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,310
Let me do that in a
different color.

118
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,120
So then I get 2, 7, minus 5.

119
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,780
Then I get 4 minus 3, 2.

120
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,420
I have to do one
more row here.

121
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,030
So let me just make that
minus 1, 3, and 0.

122
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,280
That is my matrix C.

123
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,300
So what is-- let me do that,
and I like to be

124
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,210
aesthetically pleasing.

125
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,510
So let me close the bracket
in the same color.

126
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,310
So what is C transpose
going to be?

127
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,295
So, C transpose.

128
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:06,000
Let me do that in a
different color.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,620
C transpose is now going
to be a 3 by 4 matrix.

130
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,980
And, essentially, it's going
to be the matrix C with all

131
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,150
the rows swapped for the columns
or all the columns

132
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,830
swapped for the rows.

133
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,050
So, it's now going to
be a 3 by 4 matrix.

134
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,050
   

135
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,110
And that first row there
is now going to

136
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,360
become the first column.

137
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,650
1, 0, minus 1.

138
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,890
The second row here
is now going to

139
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,180
become the second column.

140
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,760
2, 7, minus 5.

141
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,420
I didn't use the exact same
green, but you get the idea.

142
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,830
This third row will become
the third column.

143
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,420
4, minus 3, 2.

144
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,620
And then, finally, the
fourth row will

145
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,760
become the fourth column.

146
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,470
Minus 1, 3, and 0.

147
00:06:52,470 --> 00:07:03,766
All we did is, this guy was in
the second row, third column.

148
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:06,340
   

149
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,690
Now, that same guy
is in the what?

150
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:19,450
He is in the second column
and the third row.

151
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,920
All we did is switch the
rows and the columns.

152
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,370
We could do it with another.

153
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:23,920
Let's see.

154
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,200
Let's do it with this
one right here.

155
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,100
This guy right here is
in the third row.

156
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,980
1, 2, 3.

157
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,230
And the second column.

158
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,460
   

159
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:43,930
And when you go down here this
guy is now in the third column

160
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,600
and the second row.

161
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,350
That's all a transpose is.

162
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,670
And, just as a little
interesting thing, what

163
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,860
happens if we take the transpose
of the transpose?

164
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,660
So what happens if we
take C transpose and

165
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,710
then transpose that?

166
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,650
What is that going
to be equal to?

167
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,070
Well to go from C to C
transpose, we switched all the

168
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,150
rows and the columns.

169
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,970
All the entries the
rows and columns.

170
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,880
When you take the transpose
again, remember let's just

171
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,580
focus on this guy.

172
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,000
This was second row,
third column.

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,690
You took the transpose,
it becomes second

174
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,140
column and third row.

175
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,940
If you were to take the
transpose again of that, he

176
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,100
would then become the second
row and third column again.

177
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,375
So C transpose, the transpose
of C transpose, is

178
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,740
just equal to C.

179
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,130
You're swapping all
the columns when

180
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,120
you take the transpose.

181
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,380
And when you take the
transpose again, you

182
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,730
swap them all back.

183
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,150
That's all that means.

184
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,679
Anyway.

185
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,630
Hope you found that useful.
