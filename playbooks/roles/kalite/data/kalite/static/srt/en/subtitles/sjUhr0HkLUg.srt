1
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:06,339
We're asked:"What are the domain and range of the sine function?"

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,046
So to think about that, let's actually draw the sine function out.

3
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:13,074
And what I have here... on the left hand side right

4
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:19,810
over here I've got a unit circle and let me truncate this a little bit

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,049
I don't need that space over here so let me clear that out.

6
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:25,087
So I have a unit circle on the left hand side right over here

7
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:29,195
and I'm going to use that to figure out the values of sine of theta

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,623
for a given theta. So on the unit circle this is x

9
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:37,401
and this is y. Or you could even view this as the...

10
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:40,195
Well we could just use X and Y and so for a given theta

11
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:44,093
we can see where the terminal side of the angle intersects

12
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:48,938
the unit circle and the y coordinate of that point is going to be sine of theta.

13
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:54,535
And over here I'm going to graph still y in the vertical axis

14
00:00:54,535 --> 00:01:02,112
but I'm going to graph the graph of y = sine of theta

15
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:05,389
and on the horizontal axis, I'm not going to graph x

16
00:01:05,389 --> 00:01:08,356
but I'm going to graph theta. We can view theta as

17
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:13,569
independent variable here and theta is going to be in radians.

18
00:01:13,569 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we're essentially going to pick a bunch of thetas

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then come up with what sine of theta is and then graph it.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's set up a little bit of a table here.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Over here I have theta

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and over here we're going to figure out what sine of theta is.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we can do a bunch of theta values. We could start

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at zero. What is sine of theta going to be?

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When the angle is zero we intersect the unit circle right over there

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the y coordinate of this is still zero, this is the point (1,0).

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The y-coordinate is zero, so sine of theta is zero.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We can say sine of zero = zero.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's try theta is equal to pi/2.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm just doing the ones that are really easy to figure out.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So theta is equal to pi/2,

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's the same thing as a 90 degree angle

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the terminal side is going to be right along the y-axis.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just like that. Where it intersects the unit circle

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is right over here, and what point is that?

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, that's the point (0,1).

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what is the sine of pi/2?

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, sine of pi/2 is just the y-coordinate

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here is 1.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sine of pi/2 is one.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's keep going and you might see a little pattern here

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're just going more and more around the circle

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's think about what happens when theta

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to pi. What is the sine of pi?

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well we intersect the unit circle right over there

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that coordinate is (-1,0)

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sine is the y-coordinate, so this right over here

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is sine of pi. Sine of pi is zero.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's go to 3pi/2. Well now we've gone 3/4

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the way around the circle, we intersect the terminal side

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the angle and it intersects the unit circle right over here

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so based on that what is the sine of 3pi/2?

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, this point right over here is the point (0,-1)

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the sine of theta is the same thing as the y-coordinate

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or the y-coordinate is the sine of theta

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so when theta is 3pi/2, sine of theta is equal to -1.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let's come full circle here.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's go all the way to theta equalling 2pi. I'll just use the yellow here.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What happens when theta is equal to 2pi?

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, then we have gone all the way around the circle

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are back to where we started and the

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
y-coordinate is zero, so sine of 2pi is once again zero.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we were keep going around we're going to start

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
seeing, as we keep incrementing the angle

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are going to see the same pattern emerge again.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's try to graph this.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So when theta is equal to zero sine of theta is zero.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When theta is equal to pi/2 sine of theta is one.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we'll use the same scale. Sine of theta is equal to one.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll just make... this is one on this axis and on that axis

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we can maybe see a little bit of a parallel here

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When theta is equal to pi, sine of theta is zero.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we go back right over there.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When theta is equal to 3pi/2,

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that would be right over here

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3pi/2, sine of theta is negative one.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is negative one over here

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll do the same scale over here, I'll make this negative

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll make this negative one, so sine of theta is negative one

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then when theta is 2pi, sine of theta is zero.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so we can connect the dots...

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can try other points in between and you get something...

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you get a graph that looks something like this.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My best attempt at drawing it freehand, it looks something like this

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's a reason why curves that look like this are called sinusoids.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because they're the graph of the sine function. So just like this...

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But that's not the entire graph, we could keep going

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We could go, we could add another pi/2

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you added another pi/2 so if you go to 2pi and then add another pi/2

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you could view this as 2 1/2pi or however you want to think about it.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then you're going to go back over here

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so then you going to get back to sine of theta being equal to one.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you're going to go back to this point right over here

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you could keep going, you go another pi/2

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you're going to go back to this point and you're going to be over here

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so the curve, or the function sine of theta

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is really defined for any real theta value that you choose.

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well what about negatives?

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Obviously, I agree as you keep increasing theta like this

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we just keep going around and around the circle

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this pattern kind of emerges.

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But what happens when we go in the negative direction?

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, let's try it out.

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What happens if we were to take negative pi/2

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me do that...

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So negative pi/2, well that's going right over here

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so, we intersect the unit circle right over there

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the y-coordinate is negative 1

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so sine of negative pi/2 is negative one

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we see that it just continues.

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So sine of theta is defined for any positive

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative, or any theta;

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
positive or negative, non-negative, zero, anything. So it's defined for anything.

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let's go back to the question.

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I could just keep drawing the function on and on and on.

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's go back to the question.

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the domain of the sine function.

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And just as a reminder, the domain are all of the inputs

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over which the function is defined or all

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the valid inputs into the function will spit out a valid answer.

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what is the domain of the sine function?

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we already saw. We can put in any theta here.

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you could say the domain is all real numbers.

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now what about the range?

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just as a review the range is, sometimes

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in more technical math classes it's called the image

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's the set of all the values that the function can actually take on.

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, what is that set, what is the range here?

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What are all the values that y equals sine of theta could actually take on?

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we see that it keeps going between positive one and then to negative one.

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then back to positive one and then to negative one.

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It takes on all values in between.

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you see that sine of theta is always going to be less than or equal to one

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it's always going to be greater than or equal to negative one.

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you could say that the range of sine of theta is the set

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of all numbers between negative one and positive one

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it includes negative one and one

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's why we put brackets here instead of parentheses.
