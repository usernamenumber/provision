1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,230
We're given a system of
equations here, and we're told

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,240
to solve for x and y.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,360
Now, the easiest thing to do
here, since in both equations

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,700
they're explicitly solved for y,
is say, well, if y is equal

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,080
to that, and y also has to equal
this second equation,

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,080
then why don't we just set
them equal to each other?

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,430
Or another way to think about
it is, if y is equal to this

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,920
whole thing right over here--
that's what that first

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,770
equation is telling us-- and if
we have to find an x and a

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,110
y that satisfy both of these
equations, if y is equal to

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,800
that, why can't I just
substitute that

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,690
right here for y?

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,760
And if we do that, the left-hand
side of this bottom

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,370
equation becomes negative
1/4x plus 100.

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,150
And then that is going to be
equal to this right-hand

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,580
side-- and I'll do it in the
same color-- is equal to

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,270
negative 1/4x plus 120.

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,470
Now, the first thing we might
want to do is maybe get all of

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,240
our x terms onto the
left- or the

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,820
right-hand side of the equation.

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,810
And if we wanted to get rid
of these x terms from the

23
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,420
right-hand side, get them on the
left-hand side, the best

24
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,750
thing to do is to add 1/4x to
both sides of this equation.

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,970
So let me do that.

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,820
So we're going to add 1/4x here,
add 1/4x here, and you

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,430
might already be sensing that
something shady is going on.

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,750
So let's do it.

29
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,040
So negative 1/4x plus 1/4x.

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,720
They cancel out.

31
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,990
You get 0x.

32
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,760
So the left side of the
equation is just 100.

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,370
And then the right side of
the equation, same thing.

34
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,240
Negative 1/4x plus 1/4x.

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,320
They cancel out.

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,210
No x's.

37
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,050
And you're just left with
is equal to 120.

38
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,590
Which we know is definitely
not the case.

39
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,870
100 is not equal to 120.

40
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,810
We got this nonsensical
equation here,

41
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,420
that 100 equals 120.

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,305
So this type of system
has no solution.

43
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:58,050
   

44
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,160
You know it has no solution
because in order for it to

45
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,510
have any solution, these two
numbers would have to be equal

46
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,020
to each other, and they are
not equal to each other.

47
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,210
And if you look at the original
equations, it might

48
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,840
jump out at you why they
have no solutions.

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,820
Both of these lines, or both
of these equations, if you

50
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,620
view them as lines, have
the exact same slope.

51
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,290
But they have different
y-intercepts.

52
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,580
So if I just were to do a
really quick graph here.

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,350
   

54
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,650
That's my y-axis, that is my
x-axis, so it's y and x.

55
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,740
This first graph over here,
its y-intercept is 100.

56
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,190
Let me do it a little
bit lower.

57
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,792
Its y-intercept-- let's say
that that is 100, so it

58
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:43,870
intersects right there.

59
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,830
And there's a slope
of negative 1/4.

60
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,800
So maybe it looks something
like this.

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,380
That's that first line.

62
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,030
This second line-- I'll do it
in pink right here-- y is

63
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,980
equal to negative 1/4x plus 120,
its y-intercept might be

64
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,610
right here at 120.

65
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,540
But it has the same slope,
negative 1/4, so its slope,

66
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,530
the line would look something
like this.

67
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,520
So you see that there are no x
and y points that satisfy both

68
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,770
of these equations.

69
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,030
Another way to think about it.

70
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,300
If y-- you take an x.

71
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,740
This first equation says, OK,
you take your x, multiply it

72
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,350
by negative 1/4, and
add 100, and that's

73
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,200
going to give you y.

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,020
Now, here we say, well, you
take that same x, and you

75
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,950
multiply it by negative 1/4 and
add 120, and that has to

76
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,870
be equal to y.

77
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,480
Well, the only way that that
would ever be true is if 100

78
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,540
and 120 were the same
number, and they're

79
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,390
not the same number.

80
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,390
So you're never going to have
a solution of this system.

81
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,120
These two lines are never going
to intersect, and that's

82
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,250
because they have the
exact same slope.

83
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,666
