1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,030
The number of all possible values of theta,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,890
where theta is between zero and pi

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,140
for which the system of equations

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,380
y plus z cosine of 3 theta is equal x y z sin 3 theta

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,590
x sin of 3 theta is equal to 2 cos 3 theta over y

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,420
plus 2 sin 3 theta over z

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,640
xyz sin 3 theta is equal y plus two z cos of 3 theta

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,500
plus y sin 3 theta, has a solution

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,960
x naught y naught z naught with y naught and z naught

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,920
not equal to zero is, which means either of these cannot equal zero

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,530
So this is a pretty daunting thing,

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,680
I just like to simplify this as much as possible.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,410
I want to do two things. All of the trigonometric functions here

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,640
they're all - they're taking sin of,

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,370
the cosine of three theta and have theta between zero and pi

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,300
I'll do a little substitution.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,690
this is just from my brain,cause it simplifies my logic a little bit

18
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,420
let's make a substitution

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,940
that u is equal to -

20
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,900
is equal to three theta

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,470
and then the u - when theta is zero, u is going to be -

22
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,710
so u is still going to be greater than zero

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,660
and when theta is pi, u is going to - have to be less than three pi

24
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:19,600
And so - let's find the number of Us between zero and three pi

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,830
where y plus z cosine of u is equal to xyz sine of u

26
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,950
so on and so forth. so that -

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,440
Let's do that substitution and I'm going to rearrange these

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,370
so that they start at least look a little familiar

29
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,170
and see if we can somehow start manipulating with the these equations

30
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,430
and actually try to cancel out terms

31
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,130
so this first one up here

32
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,180
just to get in a term ways i can recognize.

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,200
let me distribute the cosine of three theta

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,460
or which will now call the cosine of u. So let me just writ this

35
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,680
This is u

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:57,130
this is u, this u now, this is u, u, u, u and u

37
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,100
so this - if we distribute the cosine of u,

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,000
this becomes cosine of u - let me put the y out front.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:18,690
so it's y cosine of u plus z cosine of u is equal to xyz sine of u.

40
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,110
that's this first equation

41
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,820
this second equation

42
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,430
this second equation it looks like -

43
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,320
well if we multiply both sides of this equation by yz

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,650
we're gonna have xyz sine of u on the right hand side

45
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,260
which is the exact same thing we have here.

46
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,480
so let's multiply both sides of this equation by xyz, both sides.

47
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,030
the right hand of the equation - no, not by xyz, just by yz

48
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,770
So we are gonna multiply both sides of this equation by yz.

49
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,070
so that these leave the denominator

50
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,430
we are also gonna multiply the right side by yz

51
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,210
the left hand side becomes xyz sine of u

52
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,000
and let me write it over here just write it like this.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,060
So this is x yz sine of u

54
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,030
and then yz times two cosine of u is going to be

55
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,260
two z cosine of u

56
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,060
so two z the cosine of u, I just swap the sides

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,300
and then yz times two sine of u

58
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,510
is going to be two y sine of u

59
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,810
so two y - two y sine of u.

60
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,910
So this is the second equation.

61
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,820
now they don't look bad different

62
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,290
when they were written like this it look very different.

63
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,060
I'll thinks about this one.

64
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,260
this side has xyz sine of u

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,910
I'll do it in magenta

66
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,540
this equation xyz sine of u.I'll write it on this side

67
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:49,210
xyz sine of u is equal to -

68
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,440
is equal to let's see we have a two z

69
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,760
Let's distribute this cosine of u. we have a two z cosine of u

70
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,970
so plus two z cosine -

71
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,200
two z cosine of u plus y cosine of u

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,900
so we have a plus y cosine of u.

73
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,000
that's that times that plus y sine of u

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,450
so let me scroll to the left a little bit. y sine of u

75
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,450
so I have rewritten these three equations.

76
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,160
The problem looks a lot less daunting right now.

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Let's try to figure out the number of Us between zero and three pi

78
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,590
that will satisfy - that will give us a solution here.

79
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,120
so let's see all of these three equations are equal to

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,720
this expression right over here. so the left-hand sides -

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,400
the left-hand sides of these equations all have to equal each other

82
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,690
because they're all equaled the exact same value

83
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,680
so let's do that. Let's see what we can do in the way of canceling

84
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,810
in the way of canceling things out.

85
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,490
Let's see if we use this is a plus right here.

86
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,490
I don't know I wrote an equal here

87
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,870
so let's see if we write this has got to be equal to that.

88
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,870
So let me use these two first

89
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,000
so this thing

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:21,530
so we have two y sine of u plus two z cosine of u

91
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,720
is equal to this which is that, which has to be equal to this,

92
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:32,860
is going to be equal to y sine of u plus y cosine of u

93
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:39,080
plus two z cosine - plus two z cosine of u

94
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,220
we have two z cosine of u on both sides,

95
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,620
so that gets rid of the z terms

96
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,520
and then we have a two y sine of u and we have a y sine of u.

97
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,740
So if we subtract y sine of u from both sides

98
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,990
we end up with a y sine of u

99
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,870
y sine of u to subtracting this from both sides,two y minus y sin of u

100
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,880
it's just gonna be y sine of u

101
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,820
is equal to y cosine of u.

102
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,800
so in order for this, in order to have a solution here,

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,380
in order for this to be a [inaudible] statement.

104
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,440
remember y cannot be equal to zero in order for this

105
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,590
to end up having a solution

106
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,630
the coefficient on y have to equal each other.

107
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,500
sine of u has to be equal to

108
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,670
sine of u has to be equal to cosine of u.

109
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,860
so that's one constraint.

110
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,020
sine of u has to be equal to cosine of u

111
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,760
And let's think about the unit circle

112
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,640
and think about how many times are the sine and the cosine

113
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,810
equal to each other when you're going between zero and three pi.

114
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:50,930
So I got the unit circle right over here

115
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,360
now clearly when we're at forty five degrees

116
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,480
sine and cosine are equal to each other or forty five degrees

117
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,300
is the same thing as pi over four

118
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,220
there they're equal to each other

119
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,350
you might be tempted to do this over here

120
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,610
but here the cosine is negative sine is positive.

121
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,570
so that won't work

122
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,480
they're both negative over here but they're equal.

123
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,190
so that's another value

124
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,940
and then this won't work

125
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,710
So so far we've traveled to two pi.

126
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,610
we can go another half, we can go three pi,

127
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,610
so we can go back to this one again

128
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,990
so we can go back to this value again.

129
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,900
so there are one two and then when you go all the way around again

130
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,310
three values and then we can't go back to this one

131
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,200
because we can only go -

132
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,690
Let me just use another color.

133
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,160
We can only go three pi for u. So we can only go -

134
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,460
that's two pi and then go another time around.

135
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,290
that is three pi

136
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,120
so there's one two three values

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,720
so there's three three possible Us.

138
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,610
Just from this constraint, just one we use this blue equation

139
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,270
and this magenta equation. Now let's just make sure -

140
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,530
Let's just make sure that there aren't any further

141
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,720
that there aren't any further constraints over here.

142
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,290
so let's see if we can -

143
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,380
let's use two of the other equations

144
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,190
and the one that I would want to use

145
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,170
that seems like there might be some cancellation.

146
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,480
Well we can just use -

147
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,180
We could use either this guy and this guy

148
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,680
y cosine of u plus two z

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,700
Yeah. Why not? So let's use -

150
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,730
So as long as we're using all three equation in our constraints.

151
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,510
we will have kind of properly constrained

152
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,570
all of the possible solutions.

153
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,030
and so let's think about this.

154
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,880
This equals that, which is equal to that, which is equal to that.

155
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:48,450
so we can write y cosine of u plus z cosine of u

156
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,660
is equal to this whole thing over here,

157
00:08:50,660 --> 00:09:04,510
is equal to y sine of u plus y cosine of u plus two z cosine of u

158
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,450
and then we have a y cosine of u on both sides.

159
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,950
Those would cancel out.

160
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,340
we can subtract a z cosine of u from both sides.

161
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,510
a z cosine of u from both sides

162
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:23,340
and so we would get zero is equal to y sine of u

163
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,510
plus z cosine - plus z cosine of u

164
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,800
and this seems like a pretty benign statement.

165
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,880
y sine of u plus z cosine of u is equal to zero

166
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,480
let me make sure this.

167
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,930
y sine of u plus z cosine of u is equal to zero that means that

168
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,920
this is means that two times this is also going to be zero.

169
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,330
so this is equal to two y sine of u plus

170
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,090
two z cosine of u is equal to zero.

171
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,520
The only reason is I multiply it by two

172
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,320
because by now this looks identical to this

173
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,370
so - when you're used this equation and this equation,

174
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,810
I got a constraint that this expression right over here

175
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,520
this expression right over here essentially needs to be equal to zero

176
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,380
that this expression over here essentially needs to be equal to zero

177
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,500
which is ok

178
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,750
which is ok because u could make the sine equal zero

179
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,690
or x can be equal to zero.

180
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,930
remember, they didn't put any constrains on x

181
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,910
x can be equal to zero so this is really constraining us.

182
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,970
x can clearly be equal to zero

183
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,080
which could make this thing equal to zero.

184
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
so it's not limiting our constraints.

185
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,110
so now we've used all of the information that's in the problem.

186
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,570
we've used all three of these surfaces

187
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,820
essentially to find out if there's an inter -

188
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:52,250
what the constraints we have for intersection of the three surfaces

189
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,830
and the only real constraint is that

190
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,430
the sine of u has to be equal to the cosine of u

191
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,210
and there're three possible Us

192
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,730
between zero and three pi that satisfied that.
