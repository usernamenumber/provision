1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:04,567
(music playing)

2
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,633
People love definitive answers.

3
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:10,570
We really want to have a clear understanding of everything we see.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,539
Art historians especially so.

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,508
But people also love to make things.

6
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:15,727
We love to make art.

7
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:19,229
And one of the oldest works of art in the world yet found

8
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:21,067
is a small female figurine

9
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,650
that sometimes simply called female nude,

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,709
but is still universally known as the Venus of Willendorf--

11
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:28,845
a name that makes no sense whatsoever,

12
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:32,499
but really speaks to the lens that our culture looks through.

13
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:36,553
She acquired the name Venus when she was found in 1908

14
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:39,468
in a village in Austria called Willendorf.

15
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:42,011
She's only about 11 centimeters high

16
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:45,340
and she dates from about 25,000 years ago.

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,269
So she's really old.

18
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,444
And in the museum in Vienna

19
00:00:49,444 --> 00:00:52,637
where we're looking at her in the Natural History Museum,

20
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:56,798
they've shrouded her in darkness, in a glass case,

21
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,549
illuminated from above.

22
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:00,916
The outside looks like a Greek temple

23
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:04,211
and on it it says 'Venus of Willendorf'.

24
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:07,015
And in fact, in the temple, there's a little button,

25
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:08,594
because remember this is a science museum,

26
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:11,419
lots of kids, and kids love to push buttons.

27
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:15,535
And when they do, the white light on the figurine turns red

28
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,251
and a little flute music starts.

29
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:20,104
Now of course we have no idea if these people listen to music,

30
00:01:20,104 --> 00:01:21,467
what that music would have been.

31
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:25,000
It's really an attempt to fill in all the gaps.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,902
We know almost nothing about her.

33
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:29,524
We don't know why she was made, who made her.

34
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:33,066
What we have is the figure and virtually no context.

35
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:37,105
It is in some ways an anthropological object rather than an art object.

36
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:40,437
By giving her the name of an ancient Greek goddess,

37
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:42,226
the goddess of Love, Venus,

38
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:44,737
we were assigning meaning to her--

39
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:48,056
a meaning of her being a goddess figure

40
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:51,115
and somehow associated with fertility.

41
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:53,959
Now we have no reason to believe any of that is true.

42
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,053
I suppose we do have a little bit more context and that is

43
00:01:57,053 --> 00:02:00,991
this is only one of quite a number of female figures that have been found from this era.

44
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,952
This is during the last Ice Age.

45
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:05,655
And it's some of the first figural sculpture that we've seen.

46
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:10,567
What's interesting is that almost all the sculptures that have been found have been female figures.

47
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:13,997
We should say all of the figures that have been found so far

48
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:16,474
are female figures and they're nude.

49
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:18,858
But they're of different shapes.

50
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:23,481
Some exaggerate the breasts and buttocks but others are thin.

51
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:26,190
But maybe in ten years or a hundred years

52
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,524
art historians and archaeologists will find male figures.

53
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,813
So all of this is guesswork,

54
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:34,074
all we've got to look at is the figure itself.

55
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:35,275
Let's take a close look.

56
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:39,988
She has no feet and very thin arms,

57
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:42,558
which she rests high up on her breasts.

58
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,759
And she has no facial features.

59
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,736
That's consistent with almost all of the figures from this period that have been found.

60
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:52,086
There is a careful rendering of the hair,

61
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:55,067
or perhaps a woven hat that's on her head.

62
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:59,167
Some archaeologists have suggested that this might be a reed hat that she wears.

63
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,198
Oh, there's the music and the red light.

64
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:03,921
That's right. A small girl has just pushed the button.

65
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:09,306
The hands are articulated ever so slightly, defining the fingers.

66
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:13,729
And archaeologists who have looked at this carefully have suggested that

67
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:18,927
perhaps the exaggeration of the stomach and of the breasts and of the head

68
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:20,833
those are bulbous shapes throughout,

69
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,668
are partially a result of the natural shape of the stone.

70
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:25,288
This is a limestone object.

71
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,326
She's symmetrical.

72
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:29,000
And it's clearly not something that was meant to stand up,

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,662
as you mention there were no feet.

74
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:33,509
But this is a figure that would've easily filled a hand.

75
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,875
And you have the sense that this is something that was meant to be held,

76
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,865
carried in a pocket perhaps, something like that.

77
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:41,721
She does fit comfortably in a hand.

78
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:46,234
We know that she was originally painted with ochre paint, a kind of red paint.

79
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:50,066
Beyond that it's really hard to say much more.

80
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:53,124
So we'll continue to be fascinated by it.

81
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:55,906
Art historians will continue to try to find answers.

82
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:58,104
And in some ways, I'm sure, we'll always fall into

83
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,639
the trap of reflecting our own interests and our own needs

84
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,528
as we try to understand this object.

85
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:06,030
I'm not sure that we'll ever fully understand it

86
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,214
or be able to retrieve its original meanings.

87
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:08,976
Nope.

88
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:18,599
