1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,820
Let's say that I'm able to go
out and survey every single

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,650
member of a population, which
we know is not normally

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,830
practical, but I'm
able to do it.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,690
And I ask each of them, what do
you think of the president?

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,620
And I ask them, and there's
only two options, they can

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:23,230
either have an unfavorable
rating or they could have a

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,480
favorable rating.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,900
   

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,009
And let's say after I survey
every single member of this

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,240
population, 40% have an
unfavorable rating and 60%

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,760
have a favorable rating.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,300
So if I were to draw the
probability distribution, and

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,140
it's going to be a discrete one
because there's only two

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,260
values that any person
can take on.

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,160
They could either have an
unfavorable view or they could

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,880
have a favorable view.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,900
And 40% have an unfavorable
view, and let me color code

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,460
this a little bit.

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,445
So this is the 40% right over
here, so 0.4 or maybe I'll

21
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:10,620
just write 40% right
over there.

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,090
And then 60% have a
favorable view.

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,750
   

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,020
Let me color code this.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,730
60% have a favorable view.

26
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,660
And notice these two numbers
add up to 100% because

27
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,500
everyone had to pick between
these two options.

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,450
Now if I were to go and ask you
to pick a random member of

29
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,040
that population and say what is
the expected favorability

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,870
rating of that member,
what would it be?

31
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,270
Or another way to think about it
is what is the mean of this

32
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,740
distribution?

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,980
And for a discrete distribution
like this, your

34
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,690
mean or you're expected value
is just going to be the

35
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,310
probability weighted sum of the
different values that your

36
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,960
distribution can take on.

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,030
Now the way I've written it
right here, you can't take a

38
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,690
probability weighted sum of u
and f-- you can't say 40%

39
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,780
times u plus 60% times
f, you won't get

40
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,830
any type of a number.

41
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,620
So what we're going to do
is define u and f to be

42
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,930
some type of value.

43
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:16,350
So let's say that u
is 0 and f is 1.

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,330
And now the notion of taking a
probability weighted sum makes

45
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,020
some sense.

46
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:27,550
So that mean, or you could say
the mean, I'll say the mean of

47
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,710
this distribution it's going
to be 0.4-- that's this

48
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:48,790
probability right here times 0
plus 0.6 times 1, which is

49
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,870
going to be equal to-- this
is just going to be

50
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,795
0.6 times 1 is 0.6.

51
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:56,700
   

52
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,370
So clearly, no individual can
take on the value of 0.6.

53
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,190
No one can tell you I 60%
am favorable and 40% am

54
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,840
unfavorable.

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,180
Everyone has to pick either
favorable or unfavorable.

56
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,910
So you will never actually find
someone who has a 0.6

57
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,810
favorability value.

58
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,320
It'll either be a 1 or a 0.

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,720
So this is an interesting case
where the mean or the expected

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,825
value is not a value that
the distribution can

61
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,010
actually take on.

62
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:27,430
It's a value some place
over here that

63
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,840
obviously cannot happen.

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,820
But this is the mean, this
is the expected value.

65
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,580
And the reason why that makes
sense is if you surveyed 100

66
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,660
people, you'd multiply 100 times
this number, you would

67
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,850
expect 60 people to say yes,
or if you'd summed them all

68
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,110
up, 60 would say yes, and
then 40 would say 0.

69
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,480
You sum them all up, you would
get 60% saying yes, and that's

70
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,360
exactly what our population
distribution told us.

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,690
Now what is the variance?

72
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,890
What is the variance of this
population right over here?

73
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,630
So the variance-- let me write
it over here, let me pick a

74
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,570
new color-- the variance is
just-- you could view it as

75
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,640
the probability weighted sum of
the squared distances from

76
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,250
the mean, or the expected value
of the squared distances

77
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,040
from the mean.

78
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,500
So what's that going to be?

79
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,230
Well there's two different
values that

80
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,330
anything can take on.

81
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,000
You can either have a 0 or you
could either have a 1.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,140
The probability that you get a
0 is 0.4-- so there's a 0.4

83
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,910
probability that you get a 0.

84
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,510
And if you get a 0 what's the
distance from 0 to the mean?

85
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,570
The distance from 0 to the mean
is 0 minus 0.6, or I can

86
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,880
even say 0.6 minus 0-- same
thing because we're going to

87
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,770
square it-- 0 minus 0.6
squared-- remember, the

88
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:49,030
variance is the weighted sum
of the squared distances.

89
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,540
So this is the difference
between 0 and the mean.

90
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:59,880
And then plus, there's a 0.6
chance that you get a 1.

91
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,430
And the difference between
1 and 0.6, 1 and our

92
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,060
mean, 0.6, is that.

93
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,780
And then we are also going
to square this over here.

94
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,910
Now what is this value
going to be?

95
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,140
This is going to be 0.4 times
0.6 squared-- this is 0.4

96
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,930
times point-- because 0 minus
0.6 is negative 0.6.

97
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,090
If you square it you
get positive 0.36.

98
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,130
So this value right here-- I'm
going to color code it.

99
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,800
This value right here
is times 0.36.

100
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,860
And then this value right
here-- let me do this in

101
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,720
another-- so then we're going to
have plus 0.6 times 1 minus

102
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,650
0.6 squared.

103
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,600
Now 1 minus 0.6 is 0.4.

104
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,450
0.4 squared is 0.16.

105
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,790
So let me do this.

106
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,900
So this value right here
is going to be 0.16.

107
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,060
So let me get my calculator
out to actually calculate

108
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,310
these values.

109
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,500
   

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:22,870
So this is going to be 0.4 times
0.36, plus 0.6 times

111
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,590
0.16, which is equal to 0.24.

112
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:37,250
So our standard deviation of
this distribution is 0.24.

113
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,200
Or if you want to think about
the variance of this

114
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,610
distribution is 0.24 and the
standard deviation of this

115
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,190
distribution, which is just the
square root of this, the

116
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,460
standard deviation of this
distribution is going to be

117
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,280
the square root of 0.24, and
let's calculate what that is.

118
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,870
That is going to be-- let's take
the square root of 0.24,

119
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:07,330
which is equal to 0.48-- well
I'll just round it up-- 0.49.

120
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,840
So this is equal to 0.49.

121
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,230
So if you were look at this
distribution, the mean of this

122
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,390
distribution is 0.6.

123
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,250
So 0.6 is the mean.

124
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,720
And the standard deviation
is 0.5.

125
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,290
So the standard deviation is--
so it's actually out here--

126
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,180
because if you go add one
standard deviation you're

127
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,740
almost getting to 1.1, so this
is one standard deviation

128
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,900
above, and then one standard
deviation below gets you right

129
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,440
about here.

130
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,490
And that kind of makes sense.

131
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,580
It's hard to kind of have a good
intuition for a discrete

132
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,310
distribution because you really
can't take on those

133
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,580
values, but it makes sense
that the distribution is

134
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,390
skewed to the right over here.

135
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,520
Anyway, I did this example
with particular numbers

136
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,270
because I wanted to
show you why this

137
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,630
distribution is useful.

138
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,080
In the next video I'll do
these with just general

139
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,130
numbers where this is going
to be p, where this is the

140
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,510
probability of success and this
is 1 minus p, which is

141
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,410
the probability of failure.

142
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,820
And then we'll come up with
general formulas for the mean

143
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,930
and variance and standard
deviation of this

144
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,120
distribution, which is actually
called the Bernoulli

145
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,720
Distribution.

146
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,840
It's the simplest case of the
binomial distribution.

147
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,599
