1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910
   

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,760
Welcome to my presentation on
mortgage-backed securities.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,730
Let's get started.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,560
And this is going to be part
of a whole new series of

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,840
presentations, because I think
what's happening right now in

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,670
the credit markets is pretty
significant from, I guess, a

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,510
personal finance point of
view and just from a

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,730
historic point of view.

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,130
And I want to do a whole set
of videos just so people

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,870
understand, I guess, how
everything fits together, and

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,470
what the possible repercussions
could be.

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,690
But we have to start
with the basics.

13
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,170
So what is a mortgage-backed
security?

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,940
You've probably read
a lot about these.

15
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,440
So historically, let's think
about what historically

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,100
happens when I went to get a
loan for a house, let's say,

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,850
20 years ago.

18
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,920
And I'm going to simplify
some things.

19
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,250
And later we can do
a more nuanced.

20
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,000
   

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Where'd my pen go?

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,150
Let's say I need $100,000.

23
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,210
No, let me say $1 million,
because that's actually closer

24
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,710
to how much houses cost now.

25
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,080
Let's say I need a $1 million
loan to buy a house, right?

26
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,990
This is going to be a mortgage
that's going to be

27
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,160
backed by my house.

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,150
And when I say backed by my
house, or secured by my house,

29
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,230
that means that I'm going to
borrow $1 million from a bank,

30
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,780
and if I can't pay back
the loan, then the

31
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,590
bank gets my house.

32
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,210
That's all it means.

33
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,800
And oftentimes it'll only be
secured by the house, which

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,310
means that I could just give
them back the keys.

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,760
They get the house and I have
no other responsibility, but

36
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,250
of course my credit
gets messed up.

37
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,690
But I need a $1 million loan.

38
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,280
The traditional way I got a $1
million loan is I would go and

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,550
talk to the bank.

40
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,260
This is the bank.

41
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,720
They have the money.

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,830
And then they would give me $1
million and I would pay them

43
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,340
some type of interest. I'll
make up a number.

44
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,410
The interest rates obviously
change, and we'll do future

45
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,730
presentations on what causes the
interest rates to change.

46
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,890
But let's say I would pay them
10% interest. And for the sake

47
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,660
of simplicity, I'm going to
assume that the loans in this

48
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,690
presentation are interest-only
loans.

49
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,800
In a traditional mortgage, you
actually, your payment has

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,950
some part interest and
some part principal.

51
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,419
Principal is actually when
you're paying down the loan.

52
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,530
The math is a little bit more
difficult with that, so what

53
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,030
we're going to do in this case
is assume that I only pay the

54
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,770
interest portion, and at the
end of the loan I pay the

55
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,800
whole loan amount.

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,470
So let's say that this
is a 10-year loan.

57
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,530
So for each year of the 10
years, I'm going to pay

58
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:33,290
$100,000 in interest. $100,000
per year, right?

59
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,540
And then in year 10, I'm going
to pay the $100,000 and I'm

60
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,490
also going to pay back
the $1 million.

61
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,150
Right?

62
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:50,550
Year 1, 2, 3, dot, dot,
dot, dot, 9, 10.

63
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,310
So in year one, I
pay $100,000.

64
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,720
Year two, I pay $100,000.

65
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,030
Year three, I pay $100,000.

66
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,030
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

67
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,650
Year nine, I pay $100,000.

68
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,340
And then year 10, I pay the
$100,000 plus I pay back the

69
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,030
$1 million.

70
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,300
So I pay back $1.1 million.

71
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,180
So that's kind of how the cash
is going to be transferred

72
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,830
between me and the bank.

73
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,725
And this is how a-- I don't
want to say a traditional

74
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,240
loan, because this isn't
a traditional loan, an

75
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,630
interest-only loan-- but for the
sake of this presentation,

76
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,410
how it's different than a
mortgage-backed security, the

77
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,990
important thing to realize
is that the bank would

78
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,710
have kept the loan.

79
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,780
These payments I would have been
making would have been

80
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,010
directly to the bank.

81
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,540
And that's what the
business that,

82
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,800
historically, banks were in.

83
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:38,770
Another person, you-- and you
have a hat-- let's say you're

84
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,610
extremely wealthy and
you would put $1

85
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,090
million into the bank.

86
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,340
Right?

87
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,320
That's just your life savings
or you inherited

88
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,260
it from your uncle.

89
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,710
And the bank would pay you,
I don't know, 5%.

90
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,840
   

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,120
And then take that $1 million,
give it to me, and get 10% on

92
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,680
what I just borrowed.

93
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,330
And then the bank makes
the difference, right?

94
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,360
It's paying you 5% percent and
then it's getting 10% from me.

95
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,790
And we can go later into how
they can pull this off, like

96
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,270
what happens when you have
to withdraw the money,

97
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,960
et cetera, et cetera.

98
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,220
But the important thing to
realize is that these payments

99
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,210
I make are to the bank.

100
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,220
That's how loans worked before
the mortgage-backed security

101
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,320
industry really got developed.

102
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,550
Now let's do the example with
a mortgage-backed security.

103
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,270
   

104
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,460
Now there's still me.

105
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,040
I still exist. And I still
need $1 million.

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,950
   

107
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,100
Let's say I still
go to the bank.

108
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,460
Let's say I go to the bank.

109
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,710
The bank is still there.

110
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,740
   

111
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,550
And like before, the bank
gives me $1 million.

112
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,380
   

113
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,320
And then I give the
bank 10% per year.

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,840
Right?

115
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,940
So it looks very similar
to our old model.

116
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,900
But in the old model,
the bank would keep

117
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,040
these payments itself.

118
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,650
And that $1 million it had is
now used to pay for my house.

119
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,810
Then there was an innovation.

120
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,370
Instead of having to get more
deposits in order to keep

121
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,750
giving out loans, the bank said,
well, why don't I sell

122
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,030
these loans to a third
party and let them do

123
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,140
something with it?

124
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,550
And I know that that might
be a little confusing.

125
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,640
How do you sell a loan?

126
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,890
Well let's say there's me.

127
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,510
And let's say there's
a thousand of me.

128
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,020
Right?

129
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,310
There's a bunch of Sals
in the world.

130
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,820
Right?

131
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,080
And we each are borrowing
money from the bank.

132
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,740
So there's a thousand of me.

133
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,050
Right?

134
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,460
I'm just saying any kind
of large number.

135
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,040
It doesn't have to
be a thousand.

136
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,220
And collectively we
have borrowed a

137
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,430
thousand times a million.

138
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,190
So we've collectively borrowed
$1 billion from the bank.

139
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,570
And we are collectively paying
10% on that, right?

140
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,330
Because each of us are going to
pay 10% per year, so we're

141
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,470
each going to pay 10%
on that $1 billion.

142
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:49,750
Right?

143
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,930
So 10% on that $1 billion is
$100 million in interest. So

144
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,220
this 10% equals $100 million.

145
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,810
Now the bank says, OK, all the
$1 billion that I had in my

146
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,830
vaults, or whatever-- I guess
now there's no physical money,

147
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,500
but in my databases-- is now
out in people's pockets.

148
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,800
I want to get more money.

149
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,470
So what the bank does is it
takes all these loans

150
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,200
together, that $1 billion in
loans, and it says, hey,

151
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,060
investment bank-- so that's
another bank-- why don't you

152
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,750
give me $1 billion?

153
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,490
   

154
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,850
So the investment bank gives
them $1 billion.

155
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,110
And then instead of me and the
other thousands of me paying

156
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,430
the money to this bank, we're
now paying it to this new

157
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,990
party, right?

158
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,020
I'm making my picture
very confusing.

159
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,480
So what just happened?

160
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,420
When this bank sold the loans--
grouped all of the

161
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,460
loans together and it folded it
into a big, kind of did it

162
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,750
on a wholesale basis--
it's sold a thousand

163
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,090
loans to this bank.

164
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,330
So this bank paid $1 billion
for the right to get the

165
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,870
interest and principal payment
on those loans.

166
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:06,280
So all that happened is, this
guy got the cash and then this

167
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,850
bank will now get the
set of payments.

168
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,930
So you might wonder, why
did this bank do it?

169
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,210
Well I kind of glazed over the
details, but he probably got a

170
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,550
lot of fees for doing this, or
maybe he just likes giving

171
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,130
loans to his customers,
whatever.

172
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,610
But the actual right answer
is that he got

173
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,300
fees for doing this.

174
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,110
And he's actually probably going
to transfer a little bit

175
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,130
less value to this guy.

176
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,630
Now, hopefully you understand
the notion of actually

177
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,610
transferring the loan.

178
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,980
This guy pays money and now the
payments are essentially

179
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,840
going to be funnelled to him.

180
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,810
I only have two minutes left
in this presentation, so in

181
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,530
the next presentation I'm going
to focus on what this

182
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,300
guy can now do with the
loan to turn it into a

183
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,630
mortgage-backed security.

184
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,250
And this guy's an investment
bank instead of

185
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,070
a commercial bank.

186
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,820
That detail is not that
important in understanding

187
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,020
what a mortgage-backed security
is, but that will

188
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,820
have to wait until the
next presentation.

189
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,340
See you soon.

190
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:56,400
