1
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:09,910
Okay so for this experiment we're going to create a basin. We need to get a sheet of cardboard, fold the edges up to about 1 1/2 inches high.

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:16,919
and then tape them off. We're going to cover it with a black plastic table cloth and then were going to fill it with water from a water pitcher.

3
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:19,681
You want the water to be about 3/4 of an inch deep

4
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,430
So no we're just taping off our can. We're going to take a brake off blade knife and put some protective gloves on.

5
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:34,035
And we'll trim the area around where we taped

6
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:40,909
And that'll create a flap that we can pull up. And it'll allow the warm air from the can to escape.

7
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:51,327
Okay, so we've got out friend Suzie here and she want to get to the other side to meet Billy, Tommy, and Joey

8
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:53,539
And they'll have a little party and hang out.

9
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:59,576
And so they're on this side and they're all like, "Yay, lets do this, This is going to be awesome."

10
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:03,577
So they're all hanging out over there with their little ping pong ball faces.

11
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:09,993
And they're like, "Suzie, come on, lets do something, we're gonna go see a movie, we're going to a party."

12
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:18,455
And so Suzie's like(the ping pong balls tend to not stay upright well)

13
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:20,202
They have problems with that.

14
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:24,994
So Tommy's going to stay upside down over there.

15
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:29,661
Suzie's over here and she's all like "I wish i could hang out with my friends awww."

16
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:34,787
She wants to go over and hang out with them but she doesn't want to go in the water

17
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:41,410
and she needs to find a way to get across the water to hang out with her friends

18
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:48,618
So she ends up thinking about all the things she has and she has a candle and a can

19
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:59,276
a standard soda can and so she's all like oh I have a candle and i have a can.

20
00:01:59,276 --> 00:01:59,277
So she modified the can and the can has taken on some water.

21
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:14,352
She wants to use the can to get across the water in a really quick way.

22
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:22,479
So she made this thermal sail and cut it out and she's going to put the candle inside the can.

23
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:29,312
And then she's going to see if she can use it to get across the pond and to hang out with Timmy Tommy and Joey.

24
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:37,062
Alright, she going to light the candle to being releasing some of the potential chemical energy.

25
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:42,728
And turning it into kinetic energy. And that kinetic energy is coming out in the form of heat.

26
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:56,028
And so that heat is basically causing the air around the candle to expand and so she is going to get in the device.

27
00:02:56,028 --> 00:03:09,603
In the little can here and see if the candle has enough power to pull her across the lake.

28
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:13,493
And it looks like it does, here it goes

29
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,872
so whats happening is, cool air is rushing in through the mouth of the can and its being heated by the candle.

30
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:25,866
The air is expanding, its pushing on the thermal sail, the flap here and its rising out of the back.

31
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:35,907
And its causing the can to move forward and move across the little pond here.

32
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:41,322
Thats allowing out friend Suzie to meet up with Timmy Tommy and Joey.

33
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,198
"Hey guys"

34
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:51,525
They're like hey and her boat can go about its way and they can have their party, they can go to the movie

35
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:54,000
they can go do whatever they want to do.
