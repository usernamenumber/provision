1
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:06,820
Ten of us have been abducted by
aliens because they view us

2
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:09,562
as being representative
of the human race.

3
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:11,659
And what they're going to do is
they're going to test us to

4
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:14,910
see if the human race is
worthy of joining the

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,942
intergalactic council
of planets.

6
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:22,042
And if we're not, they're going
to kill us all and and

7
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:25,028
turn Earth into a mushroom
farm, because

8
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:26,135
that's their oil.

9
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:29,277
So they take us together in
their spaceship and they say,

10
00:00:29,277 --> 00:00:32,162
you ten represent all of
humanity, and the fate of

11
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:34,182
humanity rests in your hands.

12
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:37,397
And we'll give you a test.
And the test is tomorrow.

13
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:39,820
24 hours from right now, we're
going to put you all in a

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,871
completely dark room,
and line you all up

15
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,125
one behind the other.

16
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,960
So if this is one guy-- let me
see if I can draw-- so if this

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,355
is the guy in the front.

18
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:54,070
He's looking a little worried.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,048
Someone described me as the
Bob Ross of mathematics.

20
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:00,300
So I'll attempt to do a little
Bob Ross work right here.

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,053
So this would be the
first of us.

22
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:08,315
He has a business tie
on, and whatever.

23
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:10,231
He's facing in this direction.

24
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:11,777
And then there's ten
more of them.

25
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:15,536
So instead of redrawing them,
let me just copy and paste it.

26
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,580
We all look mysteriously
similar to each other.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,290
That's the second one.

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,400
And the third one.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,690
There's ten of us like this.

30
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,940
I'll do one more.

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,160
Oh that's good enough.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,530
There's ten of us, and we're
essentially lined up front to

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,560
back, so that this guy, all
he sees is the back

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,360
of this guy's head.

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,380
And he can also see the back
of this guy's head.

36
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,530
Maybe there's a slight
incline, maybe the

37
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,070
floor is like this.

38
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,960
Let me see if I can draw it.

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
The floor is at a slight
tilt, so one guy is

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,370
standing right here.

41
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,030
Another guy is standing
right here.

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,170
Another guy's standing
right here.

43
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,660
There's ten of us in a line.

44
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,130
We're all facing in
that direction.

45
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,050
All this guy right here
can see is the wall.

46
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,780
This guy can see the two
guys in front of him.

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,260
This guy can see the one
guy in front of him.

48
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,920
There's ten of them.

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,810
It goes all the way
back to ten

50
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,830
So what they tell us
is we're going to

51
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,950
line you up like this.

52
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,900
They even draw a nice diagram
like this, because they want

53
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,900
to give us a fair chance of
preventing Earth from turning

54
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,080
into a mushroom farm.

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,700
And they say, while the room
is completely pitch dark,

56
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,040
we're going to place a hat
on each of your heads.

57
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,960
And the hat will either
be mauve-- so this

58
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,450
would be a mauve hat.

59
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,260
Or they'll be green.

60
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,970
So they either get a mauve
or a green hat on the

61
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,720
back of your head.

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,230
And the hat will be designed
in such a way, it

63
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,210
won't have a big rim.

64
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,800
So that you can't look
up and see your hat.

65
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,000
This is alien technology, so it
is completely impossible to

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,740
see the hat on your own head.

67
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,040
And the distribution of the
hats will be random.

68
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,570
It could be all green hats.

69
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,690
It could be all-- well, I'll say
purple-- because I'm not

70
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,720
quite sure how to
pronounce mauve.

71
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,500
So it could be all purple hats,
it could be half purple,

72
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,050
half green.

73
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,900
It could be nine green
and one purple.

74
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,410
They don't know.

75
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,000
It could be any combination
of hats.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,760
And what they're going to do--
and they tell us all of this--

77
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,520
is that they're going to start
with the person in the back.

78
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,790
So this is the front wall,
this is the floor.

79
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,960
This is the first guy right
here, second guy, third guy,

80
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,400
fourth guy, fifth guy, sixth
guy, seven, eight, nine.

81
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,270
So there's the tenth guy.

82
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,200
They're all faced in
that direction.

83
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,170
They're going to start with
this guy right here.

84
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,460
And say, what color is
the hat on your head?

85
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:43,550
And he'll answer, either
purple or green.

86
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,790
He can only say purple
or green.

87
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,770
I have to be exact here.

88
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,720
He can only say purple
or green.

89
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,120
And he can say it as
loud as he wants.

90
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,940
But he has to say it at an even
tone, so that not more

91
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,060
information can be conveyed,
other than the fact that he

92
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,410
thinks his hat is
purple or green.

93
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,780
Although this guy is close
enough that he can hear it.

94
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,030
Everyone's going to hear what
everyone's going to say.

95
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,540
But there's no intonation.

96
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,330
And if you're right, if you say,
my hat is purple and you

97
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,750
are wearing a purple
hat, you will live.

98
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,410
And the 600 million
people that you

99
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,339
represent will also live.

100
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,709
And where they live
will not be turned

101
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,339
into a mushroom farm.

102
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:26,560
And if you're wrong, then they
will immediately-- what is

103
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,720
that Star Trek weapon?

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,610
Displace you.

105
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,920
And they'll also do it to all
the people you represent.

106
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,970
And turn all of their land
into mushroom farms. So

107
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,140
there's this huge incentive
to try to get this right.

108
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,240
So they say, we're going
to do this tomorrow.

109
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,940
And your goal, obviously, is to
try to save as many lives

110
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,940
as you can.

111
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,390
And so we're going to put you
in a room, and you guys can

112
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,880
discuss this for the next 24
hours, to come up with a

113
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,470
system so that when we put you
in the dark room and we put

114
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,265
the hats on each
of your heads.

115
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,890
I shouldn't be drawing
brown hats.

116
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,730
We'll put the hats
on your head.

117
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,670
And then turn on the lights.

118
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,860
I forgot to tell you that.

119
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,430
They're going to put us in a
dark room, you can't see

120
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,970
anything, we're all lined up.

121
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,570
Then they're going to
turn on the lights.

122
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,640
And so then they'll ask this
guy, what color is

123
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,300
the hat on your head?

124
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,240
He obviously can't look at his
own head, but he'll see

125
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,030
everyone else's hats.

126
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,890
And likewise this guy, he can't
see his own hat, and he

127
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,320
can't see the guy behind him.

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,720
But he'll hear what this guy
says, and he can see all of

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,740
the hats in front of him.

130
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,015
So they'll turn on the lights,
and then after this guy-- if

131
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:33,700
he's right he lives, if he's
wrong he'll be displaced.

132
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,170
And then they'll go
to the next guy.

133
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:36,950
And then ask him.

134
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,300
If he's right he lives,
and all the people

135
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,230
he represents lives.

136
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,800
If he's wrong he also
will get displaced.

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,150
And they'll keep going all the
way up to the first guy.

138
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,310
So our goal to essentially save
civilization, or at least

139
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,750
human civilization, is to come
up with a system to save as

140
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,900
many of us as possible.

141
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,340
So that's the first take
of the brain teaser.

142
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,690
So if you want to kind of
pause it right here.

143
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,790
And actually before you pause
it, let me just clarify.

144
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,650
All you can say is either
purple or green.

145
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,600
No intonations.

146
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,060
You can't say "pur-puuul" or
"purp-l" to kind of convey any

147
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,220
type of information.

148
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,830
All you can say is
purple or green.

149
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,890
Or pronounce it in
some weird way.

150
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,780
And there's no weird trick where
you can kind of look

151
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,770
with the side of your eyes
or anything like this.

152
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,850
You have to do it completely
based on what you hear and

153
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,750
what you say.

154
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,260
And if the aliens catch
any hint of you

155
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,570
guys trying to cheat.

156
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,350
Or all of us.

157
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,570
I'm one of us.

158
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,690
To cheat this, they'll just
evaporate everything and turn

159
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,950
everything into mushroom
farms.

160
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,580
So that's the problem
statement.

161
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,940
How do you save as many
people as possible?

162
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,800
And if you want to pause now,
feel free to do so.

163
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,850
And now I'll give you kind of
a small hint, because this

164
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,100
doesn't help you.

165
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,070
It's easy to think of a lot of
solutions that might save a

166
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,580
couple of people.

167
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,370
But there's actually a solution
that will guarantee

168
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,410
saving nine people.

169
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,160
So that's the solution that
you have to come up with.

170
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,490
And for the rest of this video
I'm just going to keep giving

171
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,140
hints, and then eventually
give you the solution.

172
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,770
So the goal is actually really
to save nine people.

173
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,840
And you can which nine people
it's going to be.

174
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,090
And so once again, pause it if
you don't want any more hints.

175
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,630
It's going to be these
nine people.

176
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,570
These nine people are guaranteed
to be saved.

177
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,720
And this guy obviously is just
going to be guessing.

178
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,590
He is the first guy to be asked
what color his hat is.

179
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,790
He has no information.

180
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,620
He can see the people in front
of him, but he has absolutely

181
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,390
no information as to what
color this hat is.

182
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,310
So he just guesses.

183
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,520
So there's a 50% chance
that he's right.

184
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,700
Without any other information,
we assume that there's a 50-50

185
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,970
chance that the hat on the
top of your head is a

186
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,480
purple or a green one.

187
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,650
So your expected number of
people you're going to save is

188
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,470
nine and a half.

189
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,600
With the system.

190
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:05,400
So these people are guaranteed
to be saved.

191
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,100
And so, there's a couple
of things that are more

192
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,760
probabilistic that don't
quite get you there.

193
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,630
That might come to
mind immediately.

194
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,140
And once again, stop
this video.

195
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,660
Because it's fun to think
of these yourself.

196
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:22,180
But this guy might just see,
OK how many green hats are

197
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,630
there, and how many purple
hats are there?

198
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,500
And then whichever there are
more of, he might say, oh my

199
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,960
hat is-- let's say there's six
purple and three green in

200
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,740
front of him-- he might
say my hat is purple.

201
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,620
And he's either right
or wrong, and

202
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,740
he might get displaced.

203
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,700
But at least he'll have conveyed
that information to

204
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,480
the rest of the group.

205
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,159
That hey, the majority of the
hats are purple, so you're

206
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,030
better off guessing purple than
green, and it'll save at

207
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,330
least six of these
people because

208
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,630
they'll all guess purple.

209
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,000
And that's OK, and in this
situation you're guaranteed to

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,320
save more than half of these
nine people, so you're

211
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,490
guaranteed to save at least
five of these nine people.

212
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,880
And then probablistically
maybe you can get

213
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,360
up to seven or eight.

214
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,620
Then there's the other method.

215
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,055
Well, there's a ton of them.

216
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:10,040
I don't go into them because
I realize I don't

217
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,860
have a lot of time.

218
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,820
So here is the real
deal solution.

219
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,900
So really pause it and wait and
watch it tomorrow, unless

220
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,390
you don't want the solution.

221
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,510
The guy in the back,
what he does.

222
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,670
So there are a bunch
of people.

223
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,610
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

224
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,220
eight, nine, ten people.

225
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,780
And they're all wearing hats.

226
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,590
And remember, we have 24 hours
to come up with a system.

227
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,870
So everyone has the system.

228
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,100
And we don't know who's going
to be in what order also.

229
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,770
That's the other thing.

230
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,500
But that actually doesn't help
or hurt you much anyway.

231
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,320
So the guy in the back, what
he does is he counts the

232
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,280
number of green or
purple hats.

233
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,770
Right?

234
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,560
This is the system we've
come up with.

235
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,300
And so this is true of whoever's
in the back.

236
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,960
Whoever's in the back has
to do this, right?

237
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,810
So if he counts that the number
of green-- let's say

238
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,460
this is our system.

239
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,080
He counts the green
actually only.

240
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,270
So count the green.

241
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,050
And he determines that
the number of

242
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,650
green is an odd number.

243
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,840
If he determines that the number
of green that he sees

244
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,600
in front of him is an odd
number, then he is

245
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,065
going to say green.

246
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,690
For the guess on the
top of his head.

247
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:49,190
If the number of green is
an even number, he's

248
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,000
going to say purple.

249
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,500
And of course, he doesn't know
what his hat color is, but at

250
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,190
least, well, one,
he has a 50-50

251
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,530
chance of saving himself.

252
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,100
But now, what happens?

253
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,260
Now, by giving this information
to the rest of the

254
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,520
group, by screaming
green or purple.

255
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,790
If this guy screams,
my hat is green!

256
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,690
Then this guy, who's the next
guy in line, the next guy to

257
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,370
be quizzed, knows that the
person behind him saw an odd

258
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,805
number of green hats.

259
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,890
Now this is interesting.

260
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,030
If he counts the number of green
in front of him, and he

261
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,160
also sees an odd number of green
hats, then that means

262
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,020
that he was not one of the green
hats that this guy saw.

263
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,210
So he must be a purple hat.

264
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,840
So he'll just say, I
have a purple hat.

265
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,390
And he will live.

266
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,050
Right?

267
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,210
And then you'll go
to this guy.

268
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,300
And let's go the other
situation.

269
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,560
Let's say that this guy,
he screamed green.

270
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,180
Which means that he saw
an odd number of green

271
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,000
hats in front of him.

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,160
If this guy counts the green
hats of the eight people in

273
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,010
front of him, and he says wow,
there's only an even number of

274
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,000
green hats, he could say, wow
I must have a green hat.

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,950
And so then he'll say green.

276
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,200
And then he'll be right.

277
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,645
Likewise, this guy-- let's say
it's the first situation that

278
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:25,030
I said, this guy has
a purple hat on.

279
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,810
So this guy saw an odd
number of green hats.

280
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,640
He screamed green.

281
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,010
And so this guy, he also sees
an odd number of green hats,

282
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,000
because he's not one
of the green hats.

283
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,190
So he says purple, he lives.

284
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:44,290
This guy all of a sudden,
because this guy said purple.

285
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,140
And he lived.

286
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,760
I mean, you didn't
hear any buzzer.

287
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,360
Actually you know he's going
to live, because

288
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,820
the system will work.

289
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,080
He knows that there must be an
odd number of green hats from

290
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,410
him down forward, right?

291
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,700
Because this guy didn't
say green.

292
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,190
So if he knows that there's an
odd number of green hats from

293
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,770
him down forward, and if he sees
an even number of green

294
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,800
hats, he knows that he must be
one of the green hats, so

295
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,250
he'll say green.

296
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,030
And in that situation, if this
guy screamed green then that

297
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,460
means that if this guy saw an
odd number of green hats from

298
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,860
here on down, and one of these
guys behind him, or every time

299
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,010
someone behind you says green
after that, then the number of

300
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:40,270
green hats that are odd or even
in front of that person

301
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,250
will change.

302
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,410
And so they have to keep track
of that in their minds to

303
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,820
figure out if the hats in front
of them are going to be

304
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,430
green or purple.

305
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,900
Actually let me give an
example because that's

306
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,840
probably the easiest way.

307
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,120
So there's one, two-- Actually
let me just do it in a neutral

308
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,200
color so I don't waste time.

309
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,770
So let's say the hats are green,
purple, purple, green,

310
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,020
green, purple, green, green.

311
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,440
How many is that?

312
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,540
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

313
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,280
So you go to the first
guy right here.

314
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,210
And so he counts.

315
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,660
He says, OK, how many
greens are there?

316
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,270
There's one, two, three,
four, five.

317
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,950
There are five greens.

318
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,590
So the greens are odd.

319
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,830
Which says that he is
going to say green.

320
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,000
That's the system we've
come up with.

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,650
So when they go up to this
guy, he says green.

322
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,510
And he's wrong.

323
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,530
So he actually gets
eliminated.

324
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,870
And maybe the aliens were
willing to give us a pass on

325
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,070
the first guy, but let's
say he gets eliminated.

326
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,750
But he said green, so then this
guy on down knows that in

327
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,960
front of that guy there was an
odd number of green hats.

328
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,680
Now, this guy, he looks forward
and he counts one,

329
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,800
two, three, four,
five green hats.

330
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,040
So he also sees an odd number
of green hats, so he knows

331
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,070
that he must not have a green
hat, because if he had a green

332
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,750
hat, then it would turn the
number of green hats that he

333
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,760
saw into even.

334
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
So he doesn't have
a green hat.

335
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,400
He says, I have a purple hat.

336
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,650
And he lives.

337
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,600
Now this guy, he counts
the number of green

338
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,470
hats in front of him.

339
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,230
One, two, three, four
green hats.

340
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,910
He says, well gee, I only see an
even number of green hats.

341
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,850
Up until this guy, he saw an
odd number of green hats.

342
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,360
I must be a green hat.

343
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,150
So he says green.

344
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,740
Check.

345
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,030
Now this guy's turn.

346
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,400
So first of all, he knows how
many green hats this guy saw.

347
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,240
He knows that this guy saw
exactly four green hats.

348
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,950
Because if this guy had seen
five green hats, he would have

349
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,910
said purple.

350
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,810
So this guy knows that this
guy saw four green hats.

351
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,590
But he sees only one, two,
three green hats.

352
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,220
Right?

353
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,160
So he knows that he must be
one of the green hats.

354
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,710
So he screams green.

355
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,530
So check.

356
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,770
So then this guy knows, wow
there must be only three green

357
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,560
hats from him on down.

358
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,430
Because this guy must have
seen three green hats.

359
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,480
If he saw four, he would
have said purple.

360
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,050
So that guy uses that same logic
to say OK, there must be

361
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,140
three green hats from
me on down.

362
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,080
I see three green hats, so I
must not have one of them.

363
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,220
I must be purple.

364
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,820
And you just keep on going
down all the way until

365
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,110
everyone answers correctly.

366
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,850
And you save at least
nine people.

367
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,340
And the bulk of humanity.

368
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,890
And if you gave a pass
on the first guy,

369
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,880
you save all of humanity.

370
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,520
Anyway, I hope you found
that one enjoyable.

371
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,760
This is one of my favorite
brain teasers.

372
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,030
And I apologize because I
realize when I was trying to

373
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,060
explain it without the example,
it might have gotten

374
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,740
a little confusing.

375
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,130
But hopefully this example
explains things

376
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:52,890
a little bit better.

377
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,410
Although it might be confusing
to see green and purple

378
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,480
written in blue.

379
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,200
See you in the next video.
