1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,370
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,500
I actually recorded this video
earlier today, but then I

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,280
realized my microphone
wasn't plugged in.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,580
And I won't name names in
terms of who unplugged it.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,260
But anyway, back
to probability.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,160
My wife is giggling
mischievously.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,910
Anyway, so let's do a
slightly harder problem

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,650
than we did before.

9
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,230
We were dealing with fair
coins, let's deal with

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,100
a slightly unfair coin.

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,710
Let's say I have a coin and
it's-- actually instead of

12
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,330
unfair coin let's
do basketball.

13
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,960
Let's say I'm shooting free
throws and I have a free

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,180
throw percentage of 80%.

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,260
So when I shot a free throw,
8 out of 10 times, or 80%

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,610
of the time I will make it.

17
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,890
But that also says that 20%
of time I will miss it.

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,580
So given that, if I were to
take-- I don't know-- 5 free

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:54,590
throws, what is the probability
that I make at least 3

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,520
of the 5 free throws?

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,680
Well, let's think of it this
way, what is the probability

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,840
of any particular combination
of making 3 out of the 5?

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,560
So what do I mean by that?

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,370
Let me pick a particular
combination.

25
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,580
Let's say it's a basket,
basket, basket, and

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,870
then I miss, miss.

27
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,990
So that would be I
made 3 out of the 5.

28
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,490
It could be-- I don't know--
basket, miss, basket,

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,570
miss, basket.

30
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,760
And there's a bunch of them and
we'll actually try to figure

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,540
out how many of them there are.

32
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:38,060
But what is the probability of
this particular combination?

33
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,950
Well, I have an 80% chance of
making this first basket.

34
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,210
Times 80%.

35
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,320
That's a times right there.

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,670
Times 80%.

37
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,420
And then what's my
probability of missing?

38
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,680
Well, that's 20%, right?

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,460
Times 0.2.

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,790
times 0.2.

41
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:03,170
So this sequels 0.8 to the
third power times 0.2 squared.

42
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,480
What's the probability of
getting this exact combination?

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,650
Well, it's 0.8
times-- then I miss.

44
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,110
There's a 20% chance of that.

45
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:17,820
So times 0.2 times 0.8
times 0.2 times 0.8.

46
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,190
We could rearrange this because
when you multiply numbers it

47
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,450
doesn't matter what order
you multiply them in.

48
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,280
So this is the same thing
as 0.8 times 0.8 times

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,410
0.8 times 0.2 times 0.2.

50
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,680
So this is also the same
thing as 0.8 to the

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,836
third times 0.2 squared.

52
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,340
The probability of getting any
particular combination of 3

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,470
baskets and 2 misses is going
to be 0.8 to third

54
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,470
times 0.2 squared.

55
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,750
Now what's the total
probability of

56
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,340
getting 3 out of 5?

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,720
Well, it's going to be the sum
of all of these combinations.

58
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,380
You know, I could list them
all, but we hopefully now

59
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,520
are proficient enough in
combinatorics and combinations

60
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,470
to figure out how many
different ways, if we have 5

61
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,950
baskets and we're picking-- or
we have 5 shots and we're

62
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,530
picking 3 of them to be the
ones that are basket shots.

63
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,180
So what do I mean?

64
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:21,670
So let's say my 5 shots-- you
know, I've shot 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

65
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,810
Out of these five, I'm
going to choose 3.

66
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,140
So once again, I'm putting my
hat on as the god of

67
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,850
probability and I will choose 3
of these shots to be the ones

68
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,400
that happen to be the
ones that get made.

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,030
So essentially, out of
5 I am choosing 3.

70
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,400
5 choose 3.

71
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,630
And what does that equal to?

72
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:52,520
That's 5 factorial over 3
factorial times 5 minus 3

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,850
factorial, so that's
2 factorial.

74
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:04,980
And that equals 5 times 4 times
3 times 2 times 1 over 3 times

75
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,650
2 times 1 times 2 times 1.

76
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,725
We can ignore all the 1's.

77
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:09,220
Let's see.

78
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,500
We get 3 times 2 times 1.

79
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,480
3 times 2 times 1.

80
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,490
We can cancel that.

81
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,720
This 1 we can ignore, and
then this 2 and then

82
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,960
this turns into 2.

83
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,130
So there are 10
possible combinations.

84
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,980
These are two of them.

85
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,710
You know, basket, basket,
basket, miss, miss.

86
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,660
Basket, miss, basket,
miss, basket.

87
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,760
And you know, it's a good
exercise for you to list

88
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
the other 8 of them.

89
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,650
But using just the binomial
coefficient, and hopefully you

90
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,000
have an intuition of why that
works and I'd be happy to make

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,690
more videos if you feel that
that you need more explanation.

92
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,220
But I made a couple.

93
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:42,050
There are 10 combinations

94
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,220
So essentially, the probability
of getting exactly 3 out of 5

95
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,970
baskets, if I am an 80% free
throw shot, is going to

96
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,030
be-- switch colors.

97
00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:01,360
The probability of 3 out of 5
baskets is going to be equal to

98
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,720
the probability of each of the
combinations, which is 0.8 to

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,660
the third times 0.2 squared.

100
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,020
I make 3, miss 2.

101
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,150
And then, times the total
number of combinations.

102
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,690
Each of these has a
probability of this much.

103
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,650
And then there's 10 different
arrangements that I could make.

104
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,050
There's 10 different ways of
getting 3 baskets and 2 misses.

105
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,900
So times 10, and what
does that equal to?

106
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:36,320
Let me get my high-end
calculator here.

107
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,800
So let's see what that is.

108
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:53,860
That is 0.8 times 0.8 times 0.8
times 0.2 times 0.2 times 10.

109
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,450
Equals 20.48.

110
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:03,980
So it's essentially, a 20.48%
chance that I get exactly

111
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,076
3 out of 5 of the baskets.

112
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:10,340
Now let's make it slightly
more interesting.

113
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,980
Let's say I don't want it as a
probability of 3 out of the 5.

114
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,050
And this is actually something
that probably, people

115
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,145
are more likely to ask.

116
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,260
What is the probability of
getting at least 3 baskets?

117
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,070
Well, if you think about it,
this is the probability.

118
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,490
This is equal to the
probability of getting 3 out of

119
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,880
5 baskets, plus the probability
of getting exactly 4 out of 5

120
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,380
baskets, plus the probability
of getting exactly 5

121
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,992
out of 5 baskets.

122
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:45,720
We already figured
this one out.

123
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,390
That's 20.48%.

124
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,170
So what's the probability of
getting 4 out of 5 baskets?

125
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,030
Well, once again, if we want
exactly 4 out of 5 baskets,

126
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,320
so an example could be-- I
don't know-- miss, basket,

127
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,810
basket, basket, basket.

128
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,010
What's the probability of
any one of the combinations

129
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,180
where I make 4 baskets?

130
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:14,170
Well, it's going to be 0.8 to
the fourth times-- and then I

131
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,730
have a 20% chance
that one miss.

132
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,120
You know, it could have
been basket, miss,

133
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,280
basket, basket, basket.

134
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,560
That's also exactly 4, but
when you multiply them, the

135
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,590
probability of getting any
one of these particular

136
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,300
combinations is exactly this--
0.8 to the fourth times 0.2.

137
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,190
If I have 5 baskets, how many
ways can I pick 4 of them to be

138
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,870
the ones that I make if I'm
once again the god

139
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,460
of probability?

140
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:51,540
So this is going to be 0.8 to
the fourth times 0.2 times 0.2

141
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,330
times-- out of 5 baskets, I'm
choosing 4 that I'm

142
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,060
going to make.

143
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,530
So this is the number of
combinations where I

144
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,870
get 4 out of the 5.

145
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,600
So what is 5 choose 4?

146
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:09,210
That's 5 factorial over 4
factorial times 1 factorial.

147
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,995
Well, that equals just 5.

148
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:13,520
You can work that out.

149
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,540
So let's just figure this out.

150
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:24,340
This is going to be 0.8
times 0.8 times 0.8--

151
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,770
that's 3-- times 0.8.

152
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,430
That equals-- did
I do that right?

153
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,476
Let's see.

154
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:33,310
0.1.

155
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:33,585
Wait.

156
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,280
0.8 times 0.8--
yeah, that's right.

157
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,690
Times 0.2 times 5.

158
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,310
So 40.96%.

159
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,670
So this is 40.96%.

160
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,500
So roughly, 41% chance that I
get exactly 4 out of 5 baskets.

161
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,870
Which is interesting because
that's kind of my free

162
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,630
throw percentage.

163
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,200
So it's almost a little less--
you know, 2/3 shot of kind of

164
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,660
hitting my free throw
percentage on the

165
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,110
mark on that time.

166
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,020
And what's the probability
of getting 5 out of 5

167
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,760
Well, there's only one way
of getting 5 out of 5.

168
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,550
You have to get all 5 of them.

169
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,110
So this is 0.8 to
the fifth power.

170
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,110
Let me get the calculator back.

171
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:35,640
So it's 0.8 times 0.-- oh,
wait-- times 0.8 times 0.8

172
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:46,220
times 0.8 times 0.8
equals 0.3276.

173
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,300
So 32.77% shot.

174
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,330
And then we can add them
all up because we want the

175
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,130
probability of at least 3.

176
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,610
So it's going to be that, the
probability of getting 5 out of

177
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,990
5, plus the probability of
getting 4 out of 5,

178
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:05,660
which is 0.4096.

179
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,100
Plus, the probability
of getting 3 out of 5.

180
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:16,830
So that's 0.2048
equals 0.94208.

181
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:22,520
So 94.21-- roughly, rounding--
% chance, which makes sense.

182
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,900
If I have an 80% free throw
percentage on any one shot, I

183
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,750
have a very high probability of
getting at least 3 out of 5

184
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,210
when I go to the
free throw line.

185
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,590
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

186
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,540
I'll see you in the next video.
