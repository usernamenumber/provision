1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so now we've been able to express our disigma

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i think we're pretty close to evaluating the interval itself

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one thing i do want to point out that might have been nagging you from the last video

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the end of the last video took the principal root of the cosign

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of cosign squared of T

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cosign of T. And you might have said wait wait wait wait, what if cosign of T evaluated

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to a negative number, if i then squared it would've been positive and then if i were to take the principle
