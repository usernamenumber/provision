1
00:00:00,474 --> 00:00:06,636
Let's write 113.9% (percent) as a decimal.

2
00:00:06,636 --> 00:00:09,137
So percent – this symbol right over here –

3
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:11,136
literally means 'per hundred.'

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:16,403
So this is the same thing as 113.9 per 100 –

5
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:23,140
which is the same thing as 113.9 ÷ 100.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,873
So essentially, if we wanted

7
00:00:23,873 --> 00:00:24,606
to write this as a decimal,

8
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:27,122
we just take a 113.9,

9
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:29,070
and we divide it by 100.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,982
So let's do that.

11
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:33,947
113.9 ÷ 100.

12
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:35,267
If you divide a number by 10,

13
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:37,012
you move the decimal once to the left.

14
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:38,196
If you divide a number by 100,

15
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:40,028
you're moving the decimal twice to the left.

16
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:41,299
If you were dividing by 1000,

17
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:42,586
you'd move to the left once more.

18
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:43,390
10,000 –

19
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,809
Each time you divide by 10,

20
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,314
you'd go one step to the left –

21
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:47,562
which, hopefully, makes sense.

22
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:49,004
If you were to multiply by 10, we would be

23
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:50,673
moving the decimal over to the right.

24
00:00:50,673 --> 00:00:52,131
And there are other videos that go into

25
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:54,221
far more depth on the intuition behind that.

26
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,858
But anyway, we're dividing 113.9 by 100.

27
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,868
So move the decimal two spaces to the left.

28
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:02,940
So the decimal will end up right over here.

29
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,918
So this will be equal to 1.139.

30
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:10,885
And we are done.
