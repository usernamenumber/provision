PROBLEM: "Simplify the expression 28(b to the 6th)
divided by 7b." (b to the 6th == b^6)

2
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:15,412
Well, this is the same thing as 28 over 7 times b^6 over b. [Or (28/7)(b*6/b)]

3
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:21,619
and I did it this way so that we would have 
(b^6)/(b to some other power).

4
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:25,379
– and this is over b – which is the same thing 
as b to the first. (b to the first == b^1)

5
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,333
And we can simplify this 
using exponent properties.

6
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:32,982
And 28/7 we can clearly simplify 
because 28 is divisible by 7.

7
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:39,266
28 ÷ 7 is just 4. 
So that [part] is just 4.

8
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:45,799
And then b^6 ÷ b^1,
that's just going to be b^(6 - 1).

9
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:50,923
So [4] times b^(6 - 1), or b^5.

10
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:55,089
So [putting it all together,] our answer is 4b^5.
[So our answer is 4b to the 5th.]
