1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,770
Let's say you have a
six by six grid.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,170
And that's what I've
drawn right here.

4
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,980
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,720
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,970
And you were to start in
the top left corner.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,410
So, you were to start
right here.

8
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,720
And your goal is to get to
the bottom right corner.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,990
You want to get right there,
where the star is.

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,690
And you can only move
in two ways.

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,640
You can only move
to the right.

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,760
Or you can only move down.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,420
You can't move diagonally.

14
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,910
You can't move up.

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,500
You can't move to the left.

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,355
So in every step, you can't
move diagonally.

17
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:35,020
And every step will get
you a little bit

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,110
closer to this star.

19
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,360
So you can't have
backward moves.

20
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,770
And my question to you is, how
many different ways are there

21
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,750
to get from here to here?

22
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,230
That's the problem.

23
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,780
So you can pause it now
and try to solve it.

24
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,400
And I'll try-- when you unpause
it --slowly work to

25
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,970
the solution.

26
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,920
And you can pause it anywhere.

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,180
You can kind of view all the
intermediary steps as hints.

28
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,400
So the way to think
about it is, well

29
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,640
let's do the easy ones.

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,550
Let's figure out how many ways
can I go from here to each

31
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,070
intermediate cell, and maybe
that'll help us to figure out

32
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,020
how many ways can we get
to this end point.

33
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,540
So let me pick a
suitable color.

34
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,180
How many ways can I get from
this starting point to this

35
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,720
cell right there?

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,010
I can only go one way, right?

37
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,220
I can only go from here,
straight to the right.

38
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,110
So there's only one way.

39
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,740
Let me write that right there.

40
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,150
One way to get there.

41
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,620
And how many ways can I get
to this cell right here?

42
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,610
There's only one way.

43
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,210
I can only go straight down.

44
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,000
Remember, I can't go
to the right, down,

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,900
and then the left.

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,100
Because left is not allowed.

47
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,380
Every step has to give me some
progress to my goal.

48
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,190
So it looks like we've made
a little bit of progress.

49
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:50,210
So how many ways can I get
to this cell right here?

50
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,060
I could go to the right here.

51
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,580
And then I could go one more
step to the right.

52
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,860
And that's pretty much
the only way I

53
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,480
can get there, right?

54
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,060
If I go down, I can't
go back up.

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,510
So there's only one
way to go there.

56
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,400
By the same logic, only
one way to go there.

57
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,280
Just straight out.

58
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,270
One way to go there.

59
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,530
One way to go there.

60
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,710
Similarly, you can kind of
view these as symmetric.

61
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,070
I mean, when you go straight to
the right, this is if you

62
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,220
go straight down.

63
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,680
So this is one way.

64
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,870
Just straight all the way down.

65
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,550
One way.

66
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,050
One way.

67
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,080
One way.

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,470
Fair enough.

69
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,380
Now let's do a slightly
more interesting cell.

70
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,820
How many ways are there to get
to this cell right here?

71
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,930
   

72
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,370
Well, this first time,
let's draw it out.

73
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,920
We could either go down
and to the right.

74
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,310
And we could go right
and down.

75
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,350
Right, so there's two ways
to get to this cell.

76
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,990
That's fair enough.

77
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,870
And this was easy to do to work
out all the ways, because

78
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,860
there aren't that many.

79
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,130
But you might already see
an interesting pattern.

80
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,400
If I have a cell here.

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,055
Let me draw a couple of cells.

82
00:02:48,055 --> 00:02:53,546
   

83
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:57,200
Let me draw it like that.

84
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,590
And draw it like that.

85
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,970
And let's just say this is some
arbitrary cell someplace

86
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,430
in this grid.

87
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,010
It doesn't even have to
be a six by six grid.

88
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,120
It can be an n by n grid.

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,880
We could do this problem
with 100 by 100.

90
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,670
But then the video would take
long to do all of the math.

91
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,210
But let's say I want to figure
out how many ways can I get to

92
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,740
this cell right here?

93
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,550
And let's say I know that
there are n ways

94
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,730
to get to this cell.

95
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,300
And m ways-- not n --m ways
to get to that cell.

96
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,000
So how many ways can
I get there?

97
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,200
Well the only way to get to this
cell-- and I'll do it in

98
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,870
another color --the only way to
get to this cell, based on

99
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,470
the rules I gave you, is either
to go straight down or

100
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,320
go straight to the right.

101
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,575
So you can either go from this
cell, straight down.

102
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:43,080
Or you can go from this cell
and straight to the right.

103
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,070
So how many total ways can
you get to this cell?

104
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,960
Well the only ways you could
have gotten to this cell is by

105
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,410
going down from here.

106
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,420
But there was n ways you could
have gotten there.

107
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,450
So there's n total ways that
you could get to this cell,

108
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,950
and then go to this cell.

109
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,650
And then there's m ways that
you could get to this cell,

110
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,970
and then go to this cell.

111
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,260
So this cell-- or this box --I
keep using the word cell,

112
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,410
maybe because my brain
is fixated on Excel.

113
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,850
There are n plus m ways
to get to it.

114
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,470
And hopefully you understand
that intuition.

115
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,670
Because there's two ways to
get to this cell directly,

116
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,940
from that one and
from that one.

117
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,000
And I'm saying that there's
n ways to get there.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,640
So of all of the ways to get
here, there's n ways to get

119
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,710
here before that.

120
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,100
And same logic for that.

121
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,210
And you saw that right here.

122
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,230
With the two, is one plus one.

123
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,430
So there's two ways
to get there.

124
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,070
And let's see if that logic
holds one more time.

125
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,280
Just because, I don't want
you to just take this

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,860
as a leap of faith.

127
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,110
It should make sense to you.

128
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,740
So how many ways are
there to get here?

129
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,620
So based on what I just told
you, I should just be able to

130
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,330
add two plus one,
and say three.

131
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,120
But let's see if
that works out.

132
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,060
So I could go all the
way to the right.

133
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,160
That's one.

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,990
I could go two.

135
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,850
Then I could go down
and that way.

136
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,550
Three.

137
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,460
And notice, out of all of the
three ways to get here, one of

138
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,980
them comes from this cell.

139
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,720
And two of them comes
from this cell.

140
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,410
So that makes sense,
relative to the

141
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,390
intuition I just gave you.

142
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,415
So let's just fill
out this box.

143
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:13,580
Let's just fill out the box.

144
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,030
This is going to be one plus
two is three as well.

145
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,530
Let's fill out-- let me switch
colors just to make it

146
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,640
interesting.

147
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,640
This is one plus
three is four.

148
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,840
Three plus three is six.

149
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,640
Three plus one is four.

150
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,400
And you can kind of see a
symmetry along this diagonal.

151
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,710
Right?

152
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,700
There's a three and a three.

153
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,130
A four and a four.

154
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,790
And if you've seen the videos
on the binomia coefficients,

155
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,900
or Pascal's triangle, you should
hopefully start seeing

156
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,400
a pattern, or some recognizable
numbers here.

157
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,720
So what's this?

158
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,810
This is five.

159
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,880
And this square has all sorts
of neat things here.

160
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,630
You have all ones.

161
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,960
And you have one, two, three,
four, five, six.

162
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,790
Well, six right?

163
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,570
One plus five.

164
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,030
Let's see, four, five, six.

165
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,710
Six plus four is 10.

166
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,100
Six plus four is 10.

167
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,940
10 plus five is 15.

168
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,140
15 plus six is 21.

169
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,130
10 plus 10 is 20.

170
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,900
10 plus five is 15.

171
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,440
21.

172
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,110
See, this is 35.

173
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,810
35.

174
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,990
70.

175
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:20,240
35 plus 21 is 56.

176
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,490
35 plus 21 is 56.

177
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:31,030
56 plus 70 is 126.

178
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,160
And then 126 plus 126 is 252.

179
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,970
So let me do that in
a special color.

180
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,260
There's 200, right?

181
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,970
yeah, 252 ways from getting
from there to there.

182
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,430
And that was just a neat kind
of pattern problem, to

183
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,180
understand this.

184
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,030
And you could just
fill it out.

185
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,485
And you can actually do
this for any n by m.

186
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:49,710
It doesn't even have
to be n by m.

187
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,290
You could figure out, I could
have said the problem, how

188
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,880
many ways are there to
get to this square?

189
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,740
And you would have solved it.

190
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,770
Once you see that pattern, you
can just do simple addition

191
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,700
and figure it out.

192
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,820
To do it by hand, to figure out
the 252 ways of getting

193
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,090
there would have taken
you forever.

194
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,940
It would have wasted
all of your time.

195
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,150
But there's something
interesting here.

196
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,240
If you did watch the video on
binomial coefficients, you'll

197
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,700
recognize that these are the
binomial coefficients.

198
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,860
Actually let me draw something
for you and maybe you'll

199
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,080
recognize it there.

200
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,940
And this is all bonus relative
to the problem.

201
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,110
You have now solved it.

202
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,180
If your whole goal was just to
solve this problem, and not to

203
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,090
see how it connects to other
mathematics, then you can stop

204
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,750
watching it now.

205
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,130
But now I'll show you something
neat about it.

206
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,390
So, if you wanted to figure out
x plus y to the nth power.

207
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,240
And we do this a lot in the
videos on Pascal's triangle

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,420
and binomial coefficients.

209
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,240
But I want to show you it's
the same exact thing here.

210
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,620
This might actually be even an
easier way for you to do it,

211
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,170
than using Pascal's triangle.

212
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,270
Although it's essentially
the same thing.

213
00:07:48,270 --> 00:08:01,730
If you write one, x, x, x
squared, x to the third, x to

214
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,100
the fourth, x to the fifth.

215
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,430
These are supposed to go
on top of the square.

216
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,170
But I realize I was running
out of space.

217
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:13,330
You write one and y, y squared,
y to the third, y to

218
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,630
the fourth, y to the fifth.

219
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,460
And if I were to say, given
this, what is x plus y, I

220
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,820
don't know, to the
fourth power?

221
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,280
So what you can do is, you say
OK, well, x plus y to the

222
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,380
fourth is going to be, you know,
x to the fourth plus

223
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,150
something, something, something,
a bunch of terms,

224
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,650
all the way to y to
the fourth, and

225
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,640
everything in between.

226
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,409
So as you go here, where you
say, x to the fourth all the

227
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,730
way down to y to the fourth.

228
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,750
So it'll be this diagonal
right here.

229
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,580
So let me draw this diagonal.

230
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,630
So this diagonal right here.

231
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,990
And these will essentially tell
you to the coefficients.

232
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,530
And not only will it tell
you the coefficients.

233
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,430
It will tell you the mix
of the coefficients.

234
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,540
So what do I mean by that?

235
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,230
So let me erase some
stuff here.

236
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,720
This is all bonus to
the actual problem.

237
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,140
We've solved the problem.

238
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,520
So I can erase all of this.

239
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,580
So we want to figure out
x plus y to the fourth.

240
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,910
All we have to do-- and I'll
leave you the play with this

241
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,600
cube a little bit more just to
see all the patterns in it and

242
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,560
what do the numbers do along
each row and each column and

243
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,740
each diagonal?

244
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,240
But if you want to figure out
x plus y to the fourth, or

245
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,050
actually just this is
x to the fourth.

246
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,670
Or you could say one
x to the fourth.

247
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,320
One x to the fourth times one,
which is just one x to the

248
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:41,030
fourth, plus four x to
the third, times y.

249
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,260
Right?

250
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,430
That's just this one
right there.

251
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,015
Then you say, plus six
x squared y squared.

252
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:51,110
   

253
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:57,910
And they we're at plus four
x y to the third.

254
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,910
And then finally plus one
y to the fourth times

255
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,670
just a one or an x.

256
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,000
And you might say, that's
amazing Sal.

257
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,060
How did that work?

258
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,640
And the way to think about it
is, when you multiply this x

259
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,410
plus y to the fourth-- and I
encourage you to try it if

260
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,210
you're bored one day --there's
actually six ways to get an x

261
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,690
squared y squared term.

262
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,240
You'll see that when you
multiply it all out.

263
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,710
And we did that in kind of the
intuition behind the binomial

264
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,760
theorem videos.

265
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,610
But there's six ways to get
there, which is the exact same

266
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,890
problem as the brain teaser
that I gave you before.

267
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,820
How many ways can you
get to this square?

268
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,060
Well, we figured out
there are six ways.

269
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,880
Anyway hope that you enjoyed
that a little bit.

270
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,133
