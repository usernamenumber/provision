1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,907
Let's do an example of

2
00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:06,290
how a housing bubble can lead to wealth destruction.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,920
And I really just want to hit the point home that

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,724
once wealth is destroyed, all legislation can do is

5
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:14,270
redistribute who takes the losses.

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,848
That you can't create wealth, all of a sudden, out of legislation.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,657
You can maybe create incentives for investment etc, etc,

8
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:22,612
but we'll talk about that in a future video.

9
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:25,090
So let's say, in year one, I have a neighborhood and

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,358
Toll Brothers goes out and builds a new development

11
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:29,576
and they build five houses.

12
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,880
Let me draw those five houses.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:42,683
House 1, house 2, house 3, house 4, and house 5.

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,182
And let's say, that this was a normal home buying environment.

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,710
This could have been 1995.

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,430
Let's just say, for the sake of argument, this is 1995.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,410
Although, I want this to be an abstract example,

18
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,830
so we could call that year one.

19
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,000
But in 1995, these people find five new families

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,920
that go buy the house.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:15,622
They pay $100,000 each, for the houses.

22
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:17,719
These were conforming loans,

23
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,580
there wasn't this whole CDO and mortgage-backed security market.

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,820
So essentially, these people have to put 20% down, and

25
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,460
they had good credit scores, and all the rest. So immediately,

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:34,900
they have $20,000 equity and an $80,000 loan.

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,903
It's my code, E for equity.

28
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:43,175
$80,000 loan. I have to write that down. or $80,000 mortgage.

29
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:45,968
They have good credit etc etc.

30
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:48,760
Now, we have this whole securitization,

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,310
lending becomes a lot easier, becomes easier and easier every year

32
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,849
because housing prices go up,

33
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:56,030
so people stop taking risk into consideration.

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,130
And let's say, we get to the year 2005.

35
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,600
This could be an abstract example, it could be year two.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,938
In 2005, all of a sudden everyone is getting access to funding.

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,930
The people who have houses actually don't want to sell the houses

38
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,490
because they're convinced that

39
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,290
their housing prices are going up so fast,

40
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,400
that it's only a matter of time before they're millionaires

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,780
just with the housing wealth, and then they could maybe retire off of it.

42
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,110
But there's so much funding and anyone can get a loan.

43
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,950
And let's say, that these first homeowners,

44
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,737
maybe they have to move,

45
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:32,700
or maybe they just want to move to a cheaper location,

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,656
or maybe their kids have gone to college,

47
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:36,315
so they just want to downsize.

48
00:02:36,315 --> 00:02:37,900
They decide to sell their house.

49
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,770
And because there's so much demand out there,

50
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,310
anyone can get a loan, frankly, the person who's going to be able

51
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,260
to give the highest bid on the house, is a person,

52
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,010
to some degree, who's most reckless or most prudent.

53
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,630
And anyway, I won't go into that.

54
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,780
But let's say, they pay $1 million for the house.

55
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,670
They have no money down, $1 million loan, subprime,

56
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,485
negative amortization, they had no credit rating, etc, etc.

57
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,570
They pay $1 million.

58
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,260
Now, that was the purchase price of the house.

59
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,452
And we could just say, that they have zero equity.

60
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:13,716
and they have a million loan.

61
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:16,240
And of course, this guy's great now.

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,020
He probably did build equity over that 10 years from 1995 to 2005,

63
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,440
but even if he didn't, even if all he did was

64
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,370
pay the interest on this $80,000 loan.

65
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,150
This guy, he had $20,000, now he gets $1,000,000,

66
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,290
pays off the $80,000, so he essentially, gets $920,000

67
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,110
plus the $20,000 had before.

68
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:42,884
So he moves to Costa Rica with $940,000 and lives like a king.

69
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,653
Although, I've heard Costa Rica has also become expensive.

70
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:48,190
But anyway, what happens now in the neighborhood?

71
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,580
These people didn't sell their houses.

72
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,631
They didn't find some subprime individual

73
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,350
that was willing to bid up the house.

74
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,350
Nothing happened, no money changes hands,

75
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,980
but all of a sudden, these people say, well you know what,

76
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,500
our houses are just as nice as this first house that sold.

77
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,340
Maybe it's even better.

78
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,790
So our houses are also worth $1 million.

79
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,909
So we all have this kind of you could say,

80
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,550
paper wealth here of $1 million.

81
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,620
Just from one transaction.

82
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,670
And actually, this is a five house neighborhood,

83
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,839
this could happen in a 500 house neighborhood.

84
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,220
You just to find one person to overpay for a house and then

85
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,480
everyone in the neighborhood, all of a sudden,

86
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,790
feels at their house is worth that much.

87
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,290
And just out of thin air, just by one person getting cheap credit

88
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,165
and overpaying for something, everyone in the neighborhood thinks

89
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:36,512
that they just got $900,000 of wealth, or at least in this example.

90
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:41,260
You never see a nine-fold increase in property prices

91
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,030
but it wasn't crazy to see a twofold increase in a year.

92
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,420
Well, we have seen nine-fold increases over ten years,

93
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,370
it's the example here, it's actually not that crazy.

94
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,390
Anyway, that's all of their notional wealth.

95
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,500
But all these people don't want to sell.

96
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,560
One, they like their house, their kids are still there.

97
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,898
And they say, wow, in ten years my house went

98
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:06,880
from $100,000 to $1 million and in another ten years,

99
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,730
my house is going to go from $1 million
to $10 million.

100
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,830
Why would I sell it; I can then retire off the house.

101
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,129
They don't think, who could buy a $10 million house in ten years.

102
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,540
The only people who could-- well anyway,

103
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,730
I'll do another video on that, I just don't want to run out of time.

104
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,390
But they can still monetize this.

105
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,300
They could say, well when I go to my financial planner,

106
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,213
they said, oh, it's so inefficient for you

107
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:28,890
to have all of that equity sitting in your house.

108
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,830
How much equity do they have?

109
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,490
They had $20,000 before and even if they didn't build any equity

110
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,183
while they paid their mortgage, they now have another $900,000 of equity.

111
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,660
So these people, their financial planner,

112
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,810
and their siblings, and their friends at work say, oh,

113
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,025
your balance sheet is so inefficient,

114
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:52,784
why don't you take some of that equity and invest it or put it to work.

115
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:54,830
So they say, that's a good idea.

116
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,260
I'll go get a home equity loan.

117
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,020
So let's say, this person goes to a bank.

118
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:09,433
A bank says, OK, sure, I'll give you a $500,000 home equity loan,

119
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:14,650
and in exchange, get 8% interest on that loan.

120
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,654
So this is the bank.

121
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:21,630
And the bank thinks it got a great deal.

122
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,750
Because this $500,000 loan is not an unsecured loan.

123
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,670
It's not like this person can't pay,

124
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,508
they just file bankruptcy and

125
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:31,350
there's nothing that the bank can get ahold of.

126
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,170
This home equity loan is secured by the house.

127
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,399
So the bank says, well if this person doesn't pay that $500,000 loan,

128
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,027
if they default, for whatever reason, I get their house.

129
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,600
And their house is worth $1 million.

130
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
And why do I think it's $1 million?

131
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,840
Because a house in the neighborhood sold for $1 million

132
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,768
and frankly, that's how, unfortunately, housing was assessed.

133
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,240
People would just say, oh,

134
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,780
another house in this neighborhood sold for $1 million,

135
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,579
this one must be worth $1 million

136
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:59,670
because it's a very similar or maybe even a better house.

137
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,440
So this banker thinks they have a great deal.

138
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,940
This is better than buying treasuries.

139
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,962
I'm getting 8%, maybe treasuries are giving me 3% or 4%.

140
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,230
And if they default on it, I actually get an asset

141
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,400
that's probably worth more than the loan amount,

142
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,630
and I can auction that off and easily get my $500,000 back.

143
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,732
So the risk managers within the bank think they have a great deal.

144
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:22,300
And they probably sliced and diced these things and

145
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,701
sold it to other people and got it rated as triple-A and all of that.

146
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:27,220
But what happens next?

147
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,460
Well let's say, 2005, in our imaginary universe was

148
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,320
the peak of the credit cycle.

149
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,590
That was the year that credit was the loosest.

150
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,446
And as soon as some of these people

151
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:42,995
who had no jobs and got these $1 million loans,

152
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:47,577
they probably couldn't even pay the mortgage on their loan,

153
00:07:47,577 --> 00:07:49,228
not to speak of continuing it,

154
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:52,810
or even pay the low rate on the original teaser loan.

155
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,168
So maybe, they start to default, credit starts getting tighter,

156
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:59,180
and let's say, this guy actually gets foreclosed.

157
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,380
And so he gives the house back to the bank.

158
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,620
The bank auctions it off and let's say,

159
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:15,739
when the bank auctions it off, it only gets $300,000 for the house.

160
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:17,760
And in the meantime, what did all of these people do with

161
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,370
the $500,000 that they had?

162
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,810
Well their intention was to take these home equity loans

163
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,050
and put that money to work, invest it in some way.

164
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,490
And they say, well what's a better investment

165
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,939
than doing home improvements?

166
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,750
Because we all know a house is the best investment.

167
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,470
So unfortunately, a lot of that $500,000

168
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:43,970
it gets quote-unquote invested in granite countertops,

169
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:55,850
two more bathrooms per house, hardwood floors, and you can imagine.

170
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,920
They wanted to treat themselves too,

171
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,980
so they did a little vacation.

172
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,640
So it was invested quote-unquote
in their house.

173
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,700
Because they said, oh well,

174
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,135
this will increase the value of my house.

175
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:07,768
And oh, as a side benefit, I will really look good,

176
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:10,700
relative to the neighbors and live it up.

177
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,574
I can live beyond, essentially, what my income would predict.

178
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,000
And I've done some videos on investment versus consumption,

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,512
but I'd argue that this wasn't real investment, that $500,000.

180
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:23,599
That this was consumption because

181
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:26,170
it's not making the world more productive in any way;

182
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,339
it's not increasing the total economic pie for the
world,

183
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:31,753
so it's not investment.

184
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:35,589
It may be an investment if it somehow makes your asset

185
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:40,852
more emotionally appealing to some greater fool to pay more for it.

186
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:44,571
You didn't build a factory or you didn't invent some new technology

187
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:46,147
that will make all of us richer,

188
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:47,709
you just poured some money into something

189
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:49,942
that's going to make your lifestyle a little bit better,

190
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:52,160
and maybe the next person who buys your house.

191
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,350
But anyway, this house got foreclosed upon.

192
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,490
It gets auctioned off for $300,000,

193
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,360
maybe this is the year 2006.

194
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,700
Now, all of a sudden, all of these people, probably all of whom

195
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,384
who took these home equity loans, let's say all of them did it.

196
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:10,930
They all say, gee, I'm paying a $500,000 loan.

197
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,100
Actually, I'm paying $500,000 plus my original $80,000 loan,

198
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,980
so, I have $580,000 of debt on an asset

199
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,470
that just sold for $300,000.

200
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,110
So what do you think they're going to do?

201
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,638
And I just realized I'm out of time,

202
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:30,071
so I will continue this in the next video.
