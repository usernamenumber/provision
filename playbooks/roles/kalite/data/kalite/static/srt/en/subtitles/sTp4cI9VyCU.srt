1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:05,992
In the last video, I told you that we would figure out the final velocity of when this thing lands.

2
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:09,164
So, lets do that. I forgot to do that in the last video.

3
00:00:09,164 --> 00:00:13,775
So, lets figure out the final velocity, the vertical and horizontal components of that final velocity,

4
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:16,971
and then we can reconstruct the total final velocity.

5
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:22,670
So the horizontal component is easy, because we already know that

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,541
the horizontal component of the velocity is this value over here.

7
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:29,526
This 30 cos of 80 degreees, and that is not going to change at any point in time.

8
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:35,825
So this is going to be the horizontal component of the projectile's velocity, when it lands.

9
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:39,825
but what we need to do is figure out the vertical component of its velocity.

10
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:42,742
But one thing we did figure out in the last video;

11
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:47,310
We figured out what the time in the air is going to be.

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,275
And we know a way of figuring out our final velocity from the initial velocity,

13
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:54,720
given our time in the air.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,100
We know that a change in velocity

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,526
(only dealing with the vertical component, not the horizontal,

16
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:10,892
because the horizontal velocity is not going to change, as we have assumed that air resistance is negligible)

17
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:19,982
We know that the change in velocity, or the vertical component of the change in velocity,

18
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:27,174
is equal to the vertical component of the acceleration

19
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,274
multiplied by time.

20
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:34,213
Now we know what the change in time is...

21
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:41,003
And what is our, change in velocity?

22
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:47,469
It is our final vertical velocity, minus our initial vertical velocity.

23
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:51,205
And we know what our initial vertical velocity is, we solved for it...

24
00:01:51,205 --> 00:02:00,719
We figured out that our initial vertical velocity was 29.54m/s, thats 30 sin 80 degrees.

25
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:08,301
So this is going to be minus 29.54 meters per second (m/s) is equal to...

26
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:19,421
our acceleration in the vertical direction, as it is accelerating us downward, negative 9.8 m/s squared

27
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:24,914
and our time in the air is 5.67 seconds, so times 5.67 seconds.

28
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:30,892
And so we can solve for the vertical component of our final velocity.

29
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:36,093
Once again, this is the vertical component, not the total one.

30
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,742
I wrote vertical up here so you know this is the vertical component.

31
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,960
So lets solve for this: if you add 29.54 to both sides,

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,609
you get the vertical component of your final velocity,

33
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:52,310
It is not marked up here properly.

34
00:02:52,310 --> 00:03:04,309
Vertical component of final velocity is equal to 29.54m/s minus 9.8 meters per seconds squared

35
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:10,542
times 5.67 seconds, and the seconds cancel out with one of the seconds.

36
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:13,593
so everything is meters per second.

37
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,308
And so ill bring the calculator out again.

38
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:27,059
we have 29.54 minus 9.8, times 5.67.

39
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:36,076
So we get, our change, our final velocity is -26.03 ill say.

40
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:41,593
So this is, negative 26.03 m/s.

41
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:46,076
You might say, oh wait Sal! What does this negative 26.03 m/s mean?

42
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:49,064
Remember, when were dealing in the vertical dimension...

43
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:53,416
Positive means up, and negative means down.

44
00:03:53,416 --> 00:04:00,557
So it means that we are going 26.03 m/s downwards, right when we land.

45
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:06,942
So what is our total velocity when we fall back to that landing?

46
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:18,176
The vertical component of our velocity is negative 29.03 in the downward direction.

47
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:23,992
And the horizontal component of our velocity, we know, hadn't changed the entire time.

48
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:28,209
That we figured it out, was 30 cosine of 80 degrees.

49
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:33,926
Here is 30 cosine of 80 degrees. Ill get the calculator out to caluclate it.

50
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:40,492
30 cosine of 80 degrees, which is equal to 5.21.

51
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:46,742
So this is 5.21 m/s, and these are both in meters per second.

52
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:48,965
So what is the total velocity?

53
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:54,263
Well I can do the heads to tails, and i can shift this guy over.

54
00:04:54,263 --> 00:05:00,260
So that it's tail is at the head of the blue vector. So, it would look like that.

55
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:06,367
The length of this, the magnitude of our vertical component is 29.03.

56
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:09,333
And then we can just use the pythagorean theorem

57
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,753
to figure out the magnitute of the total velocity upon impact.

58
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:17,410
For the length of that, we can just use the pythagorean theorem!

59
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:22,879
So the magnitude of our total velocity, that's this length right here,

60
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:29,441
or our total final velocity, is going to be equal to

61
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:37,258
(let me write it this way), this is just straight from the pythagorean theorem.

62
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:44,708
(The square root of) 5.21 squared, plus 29.03 squared.

63
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:50,450
And we get it as being,

64
00:05:50,450 --> 00:06:03,899
the square root of 5.21 squared plus 29.03 squared....

65
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:12,883
gives us, 29.49 m/s.

66
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:17,817
That is the magnitude of our final velocity, but we also need to figure out its direction.

67
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:24,126
So we need to figure out this angle, and now we are talking about an angle below the horizontal.

68
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:28,264
Or if you wanted to view it in pure terms, it would be a negative angle.

69
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:33,028
It is an angle below the horizontal. So what is this angle right over here?

70
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:36,666
If we view it as a positive angle in the traditional trigonometric way...

71
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,730
We could use any of the trig functions.

72
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,296
Let's use tangent, we could say that the tangent of the angle...

73
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:46,762
is equal to the opposite over the adjacent.

74
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:49,846
29.03 over 5.21

75
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:55,428
Or, that theta is equal to the inverse tangent, or the arc tangent

76
00:06:55,428 --> 00:07:03,430
of 29.03 over 5.21, and that gives us...

77
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:13,699
the inverse tangent of 29.03 divided by 5.21 and we get...

78
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:25,835
79.8 degrees. But it is going to be 79.8 degrees south, or, below the horizontal.

79
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:33,238
Or you could view this as an angle of negative 79.8 degrees above the horizontal.

80
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:35,584
Either one of those work.

81
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:39,254
What is neat about this, is that we have our final velocity vector.

82
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:42,504
The entire vector, and we know what that vector is.

83
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:52,560
It is, 29.49 meters per second, at 79.8 degrees below the horizontal!
