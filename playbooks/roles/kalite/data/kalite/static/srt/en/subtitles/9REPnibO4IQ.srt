1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430
   

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,960
SAL: In the last video we saw
all sorts of different types

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,630
of isotopes of atoms
experiencing radioactive decay

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,060
and turning into other atoms or
releasing different types

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,630
of particles.

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,530
But the question is, when
does an atom or

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,360
nucleus decide to decay?

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,820
Let's say I have a bunch of,
let's say these are all atoms.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,780
I have a bunch of atoms here.

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,970
And let's say we're talking
about the type of decay where

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,550
an atom turns into
another atom.

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,500
So your proton number
is going to change.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,990
Your atomic number is
going to change.

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,490
So it could either be beta
decay, which would release

15
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,970
electrons from the neutrons and
turn them into protons.

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,520
Or maybe positron emission
turning protons into neutrons.

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,890
But that's not what's
relevant here.

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,070
Let's say we have a collection
of atoms. And normally when we

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,650
have any small amount of any
element, we really have huge

20
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,690
amounts of atoms of
that element.

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,540
And we've talked about moles
and, you know, one gram of

22
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:05,370
carbon-12-- I'm sorry, 12
grams-- 12 grams of carbon-12

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,870
has one mole of carbon-12
in it.

24
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,440
One mole of carbon-12.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,310
And what is one mole
of carbon-12?

26
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:19,170
That's 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd
carbon-12 atoms. This is

27
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,680
a ginormous number.

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,820
This is more than we can, than
my head can really grasp

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,110
around how large of
a number this is.

30
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,290
And this is only when we have
12 grams. 12 grams is not a

31
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,560
large mass.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,440
For example, one kilogram
is about two pounds.

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,525
So this is about, what?

34
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,750
I want to say [? 1/50 ?]

35
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,650
of a pound if I'm
doing [? it. ?]

36
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,500
But this is not a lot
of mass right here.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,810
And pounds is obviously force.

38
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,570
You get the idea.

39
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,240
On Earth, well anywhere,
mass is invariant.

40
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,920
This is not a tremendous
amount.

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,140
So with that said, let's go back
to the question of how do

42
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,730
we know if one of these
guys are going to

43
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,870
decay in some way.

44
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,710
And maybe not carbon-12, maybe
we're talking about carbon-14

45
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,240
or something.

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,300
How do we know that they're
going to decay?

47
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,440
And the answer is, you don't.

48
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,590
They all have some probability
of the decaying.

49
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,389
At any given moment, for a
certain type of element or a

50
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:11,360
certain type of isotope of
an element, there's some

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
probability that one
of them will decay.

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,790
That, you know, maybe this guy
will decay this second.

53
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,750
And then nothing happens for a
long time, a long time, and

54
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,600
all of a sudden two
more guys decay.

55
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,530
And so, like everything in
chemistry, and a lot of what

56
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,310
we're starting to deal with in
physics and quantum mechanics,

57
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,920
everything is probabilistic.

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,570
I mean, maybe if we really
got in detail on the

59
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,900
configurations of the nucleus,
maybe we could get a little

60
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,990
bit better in terms of our
probabilities, but we don't

61
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,040
know what's going on inside of
the nucleus, so all we can do

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,630
is ascribe some probabilities
to something reacting.

63
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,040
Now you could say, OK, what's
the probability of any given

64
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,430
molecule reacting
in one second?

65
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,520
Or you could define
it that way.

66
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,320
But we're used to dealing with
things on the macro level, on

67
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,950
dealing with, you know, huge
amounts of atoms. So what we

68
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,220
do is we come up with terms
that help us get our head

69
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,200
around this.

70
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,680
And one of those terms is
the term half-life.

71
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,930
   

72
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,480
And let me erase this
stuff down here.

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,780
So I have a description, and
we're going to hopefully get

74
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,325
an intuition of what
half-life means.

75
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:20,730
So I wrote a decay reaction
right here,

76
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,780
where you have carbon-14.

77
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,180
It decays into nitrogen-14.

78
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,740
And we could just do a
little bit of review.

79
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,100
You go from six protons
to seven protons.

80
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,430
Your mass changes the same.

81
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,870
So one of the neutrons must have
turned into a proton and

82
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,130
that is what happened.

83
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,590
And it does that by releasing
an electron, which is also

84
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,630
call a beta particle.

85
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,130
We could have written this
as minus 1 charge.

86
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,710
Relatively zero mass.

87
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,455
It does have some mass,
but they write zero.

88
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:48,820
This is kind of notation.

89
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,130
So this is beta decay.

90
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,480
Beta decay, this is
just a review.

91
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,070
But the way we think about
half-life is, people have

92
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,260
studied carbon and they said,
look, if I start off with 10

93
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,450
grams-- if I have just a block
of carbon that's 10 grams. If

94
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,840
I wait carbon-14's half-life--
this is a

95
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,300
specific isotope of carbon.

96
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,890
Remember, isotopes, if there's
carbon, can come in 12, with

97
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,970
an atomic mass number of 12, or
with 14, or I mean, there's

98
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,790
different isotopes of
different elements.

99
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,860
And the atomic number
defines the carbon,

100
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,040
because it has six protons.

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,440
Carbon-12 has six protons.

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,090
Carbon-14 has six protons.

103
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,490
But they have a different
number of neutrons.

104
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,440
So when you have the same
element with varying number of

105
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,110
neutrons, that's an isotope.

106
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,080
So the carbon-14 version, or
this isotope of carbon, let's

107
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,940
say we start with 10 grams. If
they say that it's half-life

108
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,930
is 5,740 years, that means that
if on day one we start

109
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,090
off with 10 grams of pure
carbon-14, after 5,740 years,

110
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,200
half of this will
have turned into

111
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,980
nitrogen-14, by beta decay.

112
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,270
And you might say, oh OK, so
maybe-- let's see, let me make

113
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,230
nitrogen magenta, right there--
so you might say, OK,

114
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,660
maybe that half turns
into nitrogen.

115
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,520
And I've actually seen this
drawn this way in some

116
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,200
chemistry classes or physics
classes, and my immediate

117
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,470
question is how does this
half know that it

118
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,690
must turn into nitrogen?

119
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,860
And how does this half know that
it must stay as carbon?

120
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,550
And the answer is
they don't know.

121
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,480
And it really shouldn't
be drawn this way.

122
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,760
So let me redraw it.

123
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,010
So this is our original block
of our carbon-14.

124
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,230
What happens over that
5,740 years is that,

125
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,000
probabilistically, some of these
guys just start turning

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,550
into nitrogen randomly,
at random points.

127
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,340
And over 5,740 years, you
determine that there's a 50%

128
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,000
chance that any one of these
carbon atoms will turn into a

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,950
nitrogen atom.

130
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,600
So that after 5,740 years, the
half-life of carbon, a 50%

131
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,470
chance that any of the
guys that are carbon

132
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,450
will turn to nitrogen.

133
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,890
So if you go back after a
half-life, half of the atoms

134
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,120
will now be nitrogen.

135
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,350
So now you have, after
one half-life-- So

136
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,420
let's ignore this.

137
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,550
So we started with this.

138
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,200
All 10 grams were carbon.

139
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,410
10 grams of c-14.

140
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,110
This is after one half-life.

141
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,400
And now we have five
grams of c-14.

142
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,140
And we have five grams
of nitrogen-14.

143
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,330
Fair enough.

144
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,210
Let's think about what happens
after another half-life.

145
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,470
Well we said that during a
half-life, 5,740 years in the

146
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,280
case of carbon-14-- all
different elements have a

147
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,040
different half-life, if they're
radioactive-- over

148
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,180
5,740 years there's a 50%-- and
if I just look at any one

149
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,810
atom-- there's a 50%
chance it'll decay.

150
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,380
So if we go to another
half-life, if we go another

151
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,330
half-life from there, I had
five grams of carbon-14.

152
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,591
So let me actually copy
and paste this one.

153
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,350
This is what I started with.

154
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,030
   

155
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,115
Now after another half-life--
you can ignore all my little,

156
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:33,390
actually let me erase some
of this up here.

157
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,260
Let me clean it up
a little bit.

158
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,380
After one one half-life,
what happens?

159
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,900
Well I now am left with five
grams of carbon-14.

160
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,230
Those five grams of carbon-14,
every one of those atoms still

161
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:54,150
has, over the next-- whatever
that number was, 5,740 years--

162
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,300
after 5,740 years,
all of those once

163
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,740
again have a 50% chance.

164
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,650
And by the law of large numbers,
half of them will

165
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,840
have converted into
nitrogen-14.

166
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,530
So we'll have even more
conversion into nitrogen-14.

167
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,240
So now half of that five grams.
So now we're only left

168
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,250
with 2.5 grams of c-14.

169
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,690
And how much nitrogen-14?

170
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,320
Well we have another two and
a half went to nitrogen.

171
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,190
So now we have seven and a half
grams of nitrogen-14.

172
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,730
And we could keep going further
into the future, and

173
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:38,539
after every half-life, 5,740
years, we will have half of

174
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,620
the carbon that we started.

175
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,710
But we'll always have an

176
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,630
infinitesimal amount of carbon.

177
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,700
But let me ask you a question.

178
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,600
Let's say I'm just staring
at one carbon atom.

179
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,610
Let's say I just have this
one carbon atom.

180
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,080
You know, I've got its nucleus,
with its c-14.

181
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,780
So it's got its six protons.

182
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

183
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,910
It's got its eight neutrons.

184
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,756
It's got its six electrons.

185
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:04,870
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, whatever.

186
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,800
What's going to happen?

187
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,130
What's going to happen
after one second?

188
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,180
Well, I don't know.

189
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,320
It'll probably still be carbon,
but there's some

190
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,580
probability that after one
second it will have already

191
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,000
turned into nitrogen-14.

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,710
What's going to happen after
one billion years?

193
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,960
Well, after one billion years
I'll say, well you know, it'll

194
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,660
probably have turned into
nitrogen-14 at that point, but

195
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,620
I'm not sure.

196
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,690
This might be the one
ultra-stable nucleus that just

197
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,740
happened to, kind of,
go against the

198
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,960
odds and stay carbon-14.

199
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,390
So after one half-life, if
you're just looking at one

200
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:52,280
atom after 5,740 years, you
don't know whether this turned

201
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,120
into a nitrogen or not.

202
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,690
This exact atom, you just know
that it had a 50% chance of

203
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,950
turning into a nitrogen.

204
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,130
Now, if you look at it over a
huge number of atoms. I mean,

205
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,340
if you start approaching, you
know, Avogadro's number or

206
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,350
anything larger--
I erased that.

207
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,460
Then all of a sudden you can use
the law of large numbers

208
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,850
and say, OK, on average, if each
of those atoms must have

209
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,220
had a 50% chance, and if I have
gazillions of them, half

210
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,530
of them will have turned
into nitrogen.

211
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,520
I don't know which half,
but half of them

212
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,890
will turn into it.

213
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,770
So you might get a question
like, I start with, oh I don't

214
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,860
know, let's say I start with
80 grams of something with,

215
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,580
let's just call it x, and it has
a half-life of two years.

216
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,020
I'm just making up
this compound.

217
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,720
A two-year half-life.

218
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,740
   

219
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,200
And then let's say we go into
a time machine and we look

220
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,670
back at our sample, and let's
say we only have 10 grams of

221
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,760
our sample left.

222
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,000
And we want to know how much
time has passed by.

223
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,360
So 10 grams left of x.

224
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,710
How much time, you know, x is
decaying the whole time, how

225
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,540
much time has passed?

226
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,380
Well let's think about it.

227
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:12,300
We're starting at time, 0 with
80 grams. After two years, how

228
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,400
much are we going
to have left?

229
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,980
We're going to have 40
grams. So t equals 2.

230
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,160
But after two more years, how
many are we going to have?

231
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,540
We're going to have 20 grams.
So this is t equals 3 I'm

232
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,650
sorry, this is t
equals 4 years.

233
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:31,400
And then after two more years,
I'll only have half of that

234
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,940
left again.

235
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,620
So now I'm only going to
have 10 grams left.

236
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,590
And that's where I am.

237
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,390
And this is t equals 6.

238
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,630
So if you know you have
some compound.

239
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,210
You're starting off with 80
grams. You know it has a

240
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,030
two-year half-life.

241
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,340
You get in a time machine.

242
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,130
And then you didn't build
your time machine well.

243
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,080
You don't know how well it
calibrates against time.

244
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,900
You just look at your sample.

245
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,470
You say, oh, I only have
10 grams left.

246
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:59,470
You know that 1, 2, 3 half-lives
have gone by.

247
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,000
And you could also think
about it this way.

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,760
1/2 to the 3rd power, because
every time you have 1/2 of the

249
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,100
original sample-- that's the
number of half-lives-- after

250
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,340
three half-lives you'll have 1/8
of your original sample.

251
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,450
And that's what we have here.

252
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,230
We have 1/8 of 80 grams. And
this is just when you're doing

253
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,140
it with a discreet you know,
when you're right at the

254
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,270
half-life point.

255
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,200
In the next video we're going to
explore what if I asked you

256
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
a question, how many of the
particles, or how many grams

257
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,300
will you have in exactly
10 days?

258
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,420
Or at two and a half years?

259
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,820
And we'll do that in
the next video.
