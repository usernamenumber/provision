1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,176
All the talk today is about are
we going to see inflation or deflation.

2
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:08,510
And before we do that, I think
it's really important to get a microeconomic level
understanding of

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,105
why do prices increase or decrease.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,430
We'll do a little example of
me starting a business and

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,690
when do the prices increase or
decrease in that market?

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:29,447
So let's say I wanted to start
a cupcake factory.

7
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:31,340
And then actually in the process
of this video,

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,730
even though this isn't the intent of
this playlist.

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,986
The intent of this playlist is eventually for
you to be able to go to your econ professor and say,

10
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:42,431
no,
we won't or we will have inflation or deflation for
reasons x, y, and z.

11
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:47,005
But in the process you might
learn a little bit about accounting and starting
a cupcake factory.

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:56,886
So let's say I want to start
a cupcake factory. It costs a million
dollars to build.

13
00:00:56,886 --> 00:01:07,358
And just the economics of the
factory is it costs $500,000 a year to operate.

14
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,587
So that's literally to pay the
electric bills,

15
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:13,250
to have people sitting there ready to make
cupcakes,

16
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,241
and I have accountants and all the rest.
I have to pay people to clean the place.

17
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:26,205
Let's say the economics of the
cupcakes themselves-- The cost per cupcake is $1.

18
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:32,112
Let me do that in red. I'll do all of these in red
because these are-- I'll do that later.

19
00:01:32,123 --> 00:01:38,790
So the cost per cupcake
is a dollar, one dollar cost per cupcake.

20
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,276
And where does that cost? Some of it is the incremental,

21
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:48,910
Let's assume that I had a completely
automated, robotic factory.

22
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,550
Let's say there's very little
labor at my factory.

23
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,540
And this is just the cost of
ingredients: cream, and sugar,

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,384
and butter, and those little
wax paper things that the cupcake is held in,

25
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:03,707
and the
electricity to run my robots,

26
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:11,220
and then overtime to kind of
maintain the robots that make my factory.

27
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:21,272
Let's say I think that I can
charge $2 per cupcake.

28
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:25,367
This is just an exercise and let's think about. Oh and one other thing,

29
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:35,850
my $1
million factory can produce 1 million cupcakes per year.

30
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,350
So this is a couple
of exercises.

31
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,850
Because I'm a businessman, I'm
not just going to plunk down a million dollars

32
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,970
before
I figure out how much money I can make.

33
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,478
Let's think about how much
money we can make in different scenarios.

34
00:02:47,478 --> 00:02:51,655
Let's call this scenario
one, which is kind of the best scenario.

35
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:58,619
So call this the optimistic
optimist-- is that I sell a million cupcakes.

36
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:04,447
So my factory can produce a
million cupcakes and I sell a million cupcakes.

37
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:09,649
If I sell one million cupcakes--
And I'll take a side here

38
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:14,332
because this is
an issue that I want to bring up a lot. I am fully utilized.

39
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,262
My factory can produce one
million cupcakes and, in this scenario, I'm producing
a million cupcakes.

40
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,880
So we would say we're
100% utilized.

41
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,532
How much are you producing
relative to what you can produce? 100%

42
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:29,431
So, if I sell a million
cupcakes, what would be my revenue?

43
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:31,220
And I won't go into the
details of accounting.

44
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,144
Let me make revenue in green
because that's a good thing. So what is my revenue?

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,572
If my background weren't already
black, I would make that in black.

46
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:43,080
That's why people say being in
the black or being in the red.

47
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,061
Because being in the black
means you're positive and being in the red means
you're negative.

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,611
But my background is black
so I'll use green. So we'll say being
in the green.

49
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:50,880
So what would be my revenue?

50
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,460
Well, I'm selling one million
cupcakes and this is my optimistic scenario.

51
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,190
Let's say I actually am able
to charge $2 per cupcake.

52
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,117
Obviously the whole discussion
is: what happens to this price over a bunch of different
scenarios?

53
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:12,688
So I am able to charge $2 per
cupcake, so my revenue is equal to $2 million per year. Right?

54
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:19,268
This is a million cupcakes
per year. What are my cost of goods?

55
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,800
And I'll write the common
acronym in there, COGS.

56
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,911
And this is what you'll see if
you actually look at income statements for public
companies.

57
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,800
You'll see something like cost
of goods or variable costs.

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,103
Usually, actually, cost of goods
or cost of services is what you'll see most often.

59
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:40,914
So if I have a million
cupcakes-- let me do this in red, I said I would
do this in red.

60
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:49,284
So I have a million cupcakes
times-- what's my cost per cupcake?-- times $1
cost per cupcake.

61
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:54,700
So it's $1 million per year.

62
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,120
And so what is my profit just
from selling the cupcakes?

63
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,375
Before I think about how much
does it cost for me, all of the overhead expenses.

64
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,650
Just kind of the money I'm getting from
selling the cupcakes, and

65
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:14,039
that term is called
gross profit.

66
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,364
And that's essentially
how much am I bringing in from the cupcakes?

67
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,510
And then how much are just those
cupcakes costing me?

68
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,079
So I'll do a line here. I'll subtract that from that.

69
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:29,103
So gross profit, I'm
making $1 million. Two minus one.

70
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:33,115
You might say, oh
that's great! You're making a million dollars
on your cupcake factory in this scenario,

71
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:36,147
and
oh no, we're not done yet. This is just the gross profit.

72
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,020
This is just the money directly
from the cupcakes.

73
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,830
I have all of this overhead
expense and often times, on a regular income statement,

74
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:48,682
it
will be called selling, general and administrative, or
overhead costs, or operating costs

75
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,473
or something like that. I'll just call it overhead. I'll make it red because
it's an expense.

76
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:57,436
So this should be
red too: COGS. So I'll call it overhead.

77
00:05:57,436 --> 00:06:01,469
So once again, this is kind of
the offices, the accountants, the bookkeepers.

78
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:06,040
So that's going to be
$500,000 a year.

79
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,150
And then, how much am I making
from the business now?

80
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,268
And this is called
operating profit.

81
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:18,900
How much am I making from
operating the business?

82
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,821
And I won't go into all of
the details of an income statement,

83
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:24,702
but any income
statement you look at will have this operating
profit line.

84
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:27,956
And everything below the
operating profit line, just as an aside,

85
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:31,377
will kind of cover
things not related to the actual operations
of the business.

86
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:37,121
It'll be expenses related to
financing the business if I took a loan for that million
dollars,

87
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:39,041
or it will be expenses related to taxes
and all that.

88
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:43,388
Or we're just assuming
an ideal world that doesn't have taxes.

89
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:46,981
And let's say, assume if I
inherited this million dollars, I didn't finance it.

90
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:51,214
So my operating profit is really
my profit because I don't have to pay taxes on it.

91
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,283
So let's see, I got gross profit
just from selling the cupcakes: a million.

92
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,779
Overhead: the accountants and
the people cleaning the factory and et cetera,
et cetera.

93
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:06,513
That's $500,000 a year. So my operating profit
is $500,000 and that's pretty good.

94
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:09,900
I had a $1 million investment,
one time investment.

95
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,505
And I'm assuming that this
$500,000 a year to operate also maintains my building.

96
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,448
So this kind of $1 million
investment will exist forever, right?

97
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:23,750
And I'm making $500,000 a
year in this scenario.

98
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,210
So that's a 50% return,
right, which is great.

99
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,365
If I told you I had an
investment where I could make 50% a year on your money,

100
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:33,128
you'd say here's my money, here's a check.

101
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,339
But this is, of course, an
optimistic scenario. Let's think of other
scenarios.

102
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:40,758
There's actually a ton of
scenarios because you can keep adjusting how much you sell

103
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:43,228
and
the price you sell it for and come up with different
numbers here.

104
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:47,344
It's actually a fun exercise to
do in Excel and you could do probability distributions
and all that.

105
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:52,090
But I won't worry about that right now. Let's do a pessimistic--
actually let's do this scenario.

106
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,112
What do I have to do just to
make sure that I don't lose money, right?

107
00:07:56,112 --> 00:07:59,010
So to make sure I don't
lose money,

108
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,560
let's kind of do it backwards.

109
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,780
So we're going to do a
break-even analysis.

110
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,245
And trust me, this will
eventually lead to

111
00:08:08,245 --> 00:08:12,960
whether we're going to see inflation or
deflation in this economy.

112
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,191
And I think in the meantime
you might learn a little interesting things about
starting a business.

113
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:26,170
So let's say I just want to know
what has to happen for my operating profit to be zero.

114
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,840
Right? To not be negative, what's the
minimum number of cupcakes

115
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,350
I need to make or what price
I have to charge.

116
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:38,589
So if my operating profit is
zero, we know my overhead.

117
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:40,158
This is fixed. This is a fixed expense.

118
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:41,730
There's nothing I
can do about it.

119
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,410
If you want to have a
cupcake factory,

120
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,702
it will cost you $500,000. And I'll write it as a negative
number

121
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:51,880
because we're going to subtract it from
the gross profit.

122
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:59,158
So what does the gross
profit have to be?

123
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,460
In order for this to come out
to be zero,

124
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,980
the gross profit has to be $500,000.

125
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,581
And so now we can think of a
bunch of scenarios where we end up with $500,000
gross profit.

126
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:21,287
We could, if we sold--
what'd we say? So how can we get to $500,000?

127
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:24,570
So let's say we're selling, I
don't know, instead of selling a million cupcakes

128
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,930
we're only
selling 500,000 cupcakes.

129
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:36,343
Right, this should work out. So then our revenue
will be $500,000.

130
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,310
And let's say I'm still selling
it for $2 a cupcake.

131
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,020
Times $2.

132
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,225
So that would be $1 million
of revenue coming into the door per year.

133
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:52,385
And then my cost of cupcakes,
or my cost of goods sold, is what?

134
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,850
I should be doing this in red,
I'm not being consistent.

135
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,890
My cost of goods sold is what?

136
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,480
We said it was a dollar
per cupcake, right?

137
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,330
So that's 500,000 times $1.

138
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,315
It would be silly to ever sell
a cupcake for less than a dollar, right?

139
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:12,363
Then you're just handing
checks out to your cupcake eaters.

140
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,070
But anyway, in this case, my
cost for goods sold would be $500,000

141
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,930
and everything
would work out.

142
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,180
So this is a break-even
scenario, where I sell 500,000 cupcakes at $2 per cupcake,

143
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,061
with this being the cost of goods.

144
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,738
And then I'll make $500,000
gross profit and then, take out the overhead.

145
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,050
At least I won't make a loss.

146
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,670
This is interesting because this
tells me, if I'm charging $2 per cupcake,

147
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:43,977
I have to sell
at least 500,000 cupcakes to make money.

148
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:50,426
So you might say, oh yeah, so it
would never be rational to sell anything less than
500,000 cupcakes.

149
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:51,960
Otherwise you should not
operate the business.

150
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,194
And what we'll do in future
videos is we'll actually explore situations in which
that does happen.

151
00:10:57,194 --> 00:11:01,631
And in which people start
to kind of cut prices to actually compete.

152
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:04,160
And in the process they'll be
doing very irrational things.

153
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,320
But anyway, I realize I've run
out of time in this video.

154
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,832
I'll see you in the next one
and we'll actually see what happens once I start
my cupcake factory.
