1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,933
what i want to do first is just

2
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:04,899
show you what the angle bisector theorem is

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,140
and then we'll actually

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,667
prove it for ourselves

5
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:11,169
so i just have an arbitrary triangle right over here

6
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:12,562
triangle A, B, C

7
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:14,002
and what im going to do is im going to

8
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:15,906
draw an angle bisector

9
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:18,667
for this angle up here we could have done it with any

10
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,596
of the three angles but i'll just do this one

11
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:22,268
it'll make our proof a little bit easier

12
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:25,533
so im just gonna bisect this angle, angle ABC

13
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:29,652
so lets just say that that's the angle bisector of angle ABC

14
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:34,760
And so this angle right over here is equal to this angle right over here

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,268
And let me call this point down here

16
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:39,047
let me call it point D

17
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:46,159
the angle bisector theorem

18
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,941
tells us that the ratio between the size that aren't this bisector

19
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:54,436
so when i put this angle bisector here it created two smaller triangles

20
00:00:54,436 --> 00:00:55,937
out of that large one

21
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:58,909
the angle bisector theorem tells us that the ratios between the other

22
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:02,346
sides of these two triangles that we now created

23
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:04,250
are going to be the same

24
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,204
so it tells us that the ratio of AB

25
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:19,530
to AD is going to be equal to the ratio of BC to - you could say

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,877
to CD,so the ratio of - i'll color code it - the ratio of -

27
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:32,385
that, which is this, to this, to this

28
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:33,775
is going to be equal

29
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:39,597
to the ratio of this -which is that- to this

30
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:40,541
right over here

31
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,165
to CD - which is that over here

32
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:44,329
so it kind of - once you see the ratio of that to that

33
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:45,767
is going to be the same as the ratio of that to that

34
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:47,346
so that's kind of a cool result

35
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:49,436
but you cant just accept it on -on- faith

36
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:50,922
because its a cool result!

37
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:52,591
you want to prove it to ourselves

38
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,699
and so you could imagine right over here

39
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:56,077
we have some ratio set up

40
00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:58,584
so we're gonna prove it using similar triangles

41
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,163
and unfortunate for us

42
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,253
these two triangles right here -

43
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,600
aren't necessarily similar!

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,854
we cant really

45
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:06,282
we know that these two angles

46
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:07,236
are congruent to each other

47
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:08,525
but we dont know whether this angle

48
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:09,468
is equal to that angle

49
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:09,968
or that

50
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:12,167
we dont know we cant make any statements like that

51
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:14,623
so in order to actually set up this type of a statement

52
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:15,647
we'll have to construct

53
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:17,253
maybe another triangle!

54
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,067
that will be similar to one of these

55
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:19,933
right over here

56
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:23,587
and one way to do it-

57
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:24,776
-would be-

58
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:26,773
to draw another line

59
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,259
and this is a bit of

60
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,349
this proof wasn't obvious to me the first time

61
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,324
that i thought about it

62
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:32,933
so dont worry if its not obvious to you

63
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,900
is that what happens is if we can

64
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,126
continue this bisector - this angle bisector

65
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,128
right over here

66
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:40,292
so lets just continue it

67
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:41,622
it just keeps going

68
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:42,954
on and on and on

69
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,318
and lets also maybe we can construct a similar

70
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:47,327
triangle to this triangle over here

71
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:49,175
if we draw a line that's parallel

72
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:51,764
to AB down here

73
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:53,031
so lets try to do that

74
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:53,867
So i'm just gonna say

75
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,282
well you know - you could always find

76
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:58,585
if C is not on AB you can always find a point

77
00:02:58,585 --> 00:03:00,955
that goes through or a line that goes through C

78
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:02,129
that is parallel

79
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,353
to AB

80
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:04,717
so lets just -by definition- lets just

81
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,434
create another line right over here

82
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,410
and lets say lets call this point

83
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,817
right over here F

84
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:13,631
and lets just pick this line in such a way

85
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,718
that FC is parallel to AB

86
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:20,212
so this is parallel to that

87
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:24,717
- right over there so FC is parallel to AB

88
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:25,957
and we can just construct it that way

89
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,898
and now we have some interesting

90
00:03:27,898 --> 00:03:29,518
things and we did it that way so that we can make

91
00:03:29,518 --> 00:03:32,271
these two triangles would be similar to each other

92
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,501
so lets see that - lets see what happens

93
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:35,941
so before we even think about similarity

94
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:37,705
lets think about some of the angles

95
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:40,339
or what we know about some of the angles here

96
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:43,895
we know that we have alternate interior angles

97
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,770
so just think about these two parallel lines

98
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,589
so i can imagine that AB keeps going like that

99
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:50,660
FC keeps going like that

100
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,641
and line BD right here is a transversal

101
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:56,924
then whatever this angle is

102
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:58,741
this angle is going to be as well

103
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:00,801
for alternate interior angles

104
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:01,646
which we've talked a lot about

105
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:04,224
when we first talked about angles with transverals

106
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,103
and all of that

107
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:06,621
so these two angles are going to be

108
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,676
the same

109
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:09,185
but this angle and this angle are also going to be

110
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,041
the same

111
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,210
because this angle and that angle

112
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:11,805
are the same

113
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:14,595
this is a bisector and because this is a bisector

114
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:16,870
we know that angle ABD is the same

115
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,649
as angle DBC

116
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,831
so whatever this angle is - that angle is

117
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:22,425
and so is this angle

118
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:23,742
and that gives us kind of

119
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:25,522
an interesting result

120
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:26,837
because here we have

121
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:30,954
a situation where if we look at this larger triangle

122
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:34,839
BFC - we have two base angles that are the same

123
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,000
which means this must be an isosceles triangle

124
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,180
so BC - must be the same as FC

125
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,840
so that was kinda cool

126
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,388
we just used the transversal

127
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:47,798
and the alternate interior angles

128
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,207
to show that these are isosceles

129
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:51,437
and that BC and FC are the same thing

130
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:52,815
and that could be useful

131
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:54,254
because we know that

132
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:57,179
we want to - we have a feeling

133
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,236
that this triangle and this triangle

134
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,214
are going to be similar

135
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:01,451
we haven't proven it yet

136
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,693
but how will that help us get something

137
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:04,268
about BC up here?

138
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:06,434
but we just showed that BC and FC

139
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:07,705
are the same thing

140
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:09,609
so this is going to be the same thing

141
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,141
as what we wanna prove it

142
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:12,704
and if we can prove that FC - the ratio

143
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:14,284
of AB to AD is the same thing

144
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:17,867
as the ratio of FC to CD were gonna be there

145
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:21,258
because BC - we just showed - is equal to

146
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:21,988
FC

147
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,066
but lets not start with the theorem

148
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,459
let's actually get to the theorem

149
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,007
so FC is parallel to AB

150
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:31,035
able to set up these - this one - isosceles triangle

151
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:32,364
show these sides are congruent

152
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,175
now lets look at some of the other angles

153
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:35,986
here - and then we'll make ourselves

154
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,338
feel good about it

155
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,405
but we have this -

156
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,748
- if we look at triangle ABD

157
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:41,360
so this triangle right over here

158
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,168
and triangle FDC

159
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:44,098
we already established

160
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:45,350
that they have one

161
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,082
set of angles

162
00:05:46,082 --> 00:05:47,162
that are the same

163
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:48,276
and then they also both

164
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:50,090
- ABD has this angle

165
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,848
right over here

166
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:51,701
which is going to be

167
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:52,598
which is a vertical angle

168
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:53,141
with this one

169
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:53,855
over here

170
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:54,998
so they're congruent

171
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:55,910
and we know if two

172
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,024
tringles have two angles

173
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,401
that are the same

174
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,317
- actually the third ones going

175
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,340
to be the same one as well

176
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,078
or you could say by the

177
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:03,230
angle - angle similarity postulate

178
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,462
these two triangles are similar

179
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:07,300
so let me right that down

180
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,298
you wanna make sure you get the corresponding sides right

181
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,267
we now know by angle - angle

182
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,587
and im gonna start at the green angle

183
00:06:12,587 --> 00:06:16,122
that triangle B - and then the blue angle

184
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:21,262
BDA is similar to triangle

185
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:24,267
so once again lets start with the green angle -

186
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:30,887
- F then go to the blue angle FDC

187
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:32,971
and here we want to eventually get to the

188
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:33,991
angle bisector theorem

189
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:35,846
so we wanna look at the ratio between

190
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:40,913
AB and AD - similar triangles - either you could find

191
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:42,769
the ratio between corresponding sides

192
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,944
are going to be the same

193
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:45,600
on similar triangles

194
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,255
or you could find the ratio between

195
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:49,577
two sides of a similar triangle

196
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,016
and compare them to the ratio of the same

197
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:54,174
two corresponding sides on the other similar triangle

198
00:06:54,174 --> 00:06:55,428
and they should be the same

199
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:56,452
so by similar triangles we know that

200
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:57,936
the ratio of AB

201
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:01,343
and this by the way - was by

202
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:03,452
angle - angle similarity

203
00:07:03,452 --> 00:07:04,858
wanna right that down

204
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:05,572
so now that we know

205
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:06,316
that they're similar

206
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:11,755
we know that the ratio of AB to AD

207
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:13,139
is going to be equal to

208
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,021
and we could even look here

209
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:14,795
for the corresponding sides

210
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:16,255
the ratio of AB

211
00:07:16,255 --> 00:07:17,754
the corresponding side is

212
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:19,252
gonna be CF

213
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,477
its going to equal CF

214
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:25,103
over AD - AD is the same thing

215
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:27,935
as CD - over CD

216
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:29,146
and so we know that the ratio of

217
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:32,571
AB over AD is equal to CF over CD

218
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:34,517
but we just proved to ourselves

219
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:35,972
because this is an isosceles triangle

220
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,716
that CF is the same thing as BC

221
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:39,918
right over here

222
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,694
so CF is the same thing as BC

223
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:43,761
and then we're done!

224
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:45,477
we just proven AB over AD

225
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:47,689
is equal to BC over CD

226
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,052
so there's kinda two things

227
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,396
we have to do here

228
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:52,921
- one - construct this other triangle

229
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:54,604
that allowed us

230
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:56,172
assuming this was parallel

231
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:57,790
that gave us two things

232
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,624
that gave us another angle

233
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:01,126
to show that they're similar

234
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:01,761
and also

235
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:02,690
allowed us to establish

236
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,318
- sorry - I have a - something stuck in my throat -

237
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:11,623
so we're able to

238
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,261
using - constructing this triangle here

239
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,809
we're able to both show its a similar

240
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:16,575
and to construct this larger

241
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:17,940
isosceles triangle to show

242
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,117
look if we can find the ratio between

243
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:20,370
two sides of this triangle

244
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:20,991
and this one

245
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,122
then that's going to be the ratio

246
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:23,709
of this - if we can find

247
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:24,943
the ratio of this side to this side

248
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:26,138
its the same as the ratio

249
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,379
of this side to this side

250
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,725
that's analogues to showing

251
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,400
that the ratio of this side to this side

252
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,072
is the same

253
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:32,370
as BC to CD

254
00:08:32,370 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are done.
