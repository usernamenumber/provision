1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,050
   

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,280
Before I continue, I want to
introduce you to what might be

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,050
an unfamiliar concept, although
if you've taken

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,710
chemistry, you might know a
little bit about it-- it's

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,460
called a mole.

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,030
This isn't the thing that grows
on your face with the

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,950
hair in it, or the animal that
digs in your backyard,

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,990
although those are also
called moles.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,540
We're talking about the
SI unit called a mole.

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,390
A mole is just a number.

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,010
It's like saying a mole of
something means a certain

12
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:34,700
number of something, just like
a dozen-- it's like saying

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:41,120
that a dozen eggs is 12 eggs.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,970
Just like that, a mole would
be 6-- I always forget the

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:53,550
exact number, but it's 6.023,
or something of that nature.

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,700
You could look it up--
I think it's 6.023

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,920
times 10 to the twentieth.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,320
Let me look up the exact number,
just because I think

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,840
that 23 I'm misremembering.

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:24,730
The mole is 6.022 times 10 to
the 23 of something, so it's a

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,870
very number of something.

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,110
Normally, we don't deal in moles
of eggs-- I don't think

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,870
there has been a mole of eggs
ever produced in the history

24
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,390
of the universe.

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,220
10 to the 23 is a very, very,
very large number.

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,240
Where is it useful?

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,280
A mole is useful for counting
atoms, and so what is a mole

28
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,270
of atoms or molecules?

29
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,450
What's that many molecules?

30
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,220
It's 6 followed by roughly 23
0's of molecules-- a very,

31
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,540
very big number.

32
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,810
What's interesting about a mole
is that when I have a

33
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:05,880
mole of something, its mass--
let's say its mass in grams. A

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:15,670
mole of carbon: its mass in
grams is going to be equal

35
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:22,930
to-- so if I have this many
carbon molecules, its mass in

36
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:32,970
grams is x grams. It'll have a
mass of x grams, where x is

37
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:43,616
the atomic mass number of an
atom of carbon, although if I

38
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:45,750
was talking about a mole of a
molecule, I would figure out

39
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,770
the atomic mass of the
entire molecule.

40
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,440
What's an atomic mass number?

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,010
Let me see if I can do a Web
search on a periodic table.

42
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm showing you what I do here,
and it's not fancy.

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,030
Let me go to Google, and let's
look up periodic table, and

44
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,260
let's see if we can
find a good one--

45
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,510
this one looks good.

46
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:34,540
   

47
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,410
If we go to carbon, which is
right here, we see that its

48
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,750
atomic number is 6, and
that's the number of

49
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,000
protons that it has.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,980
   

51
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,500
The atomic mass number-- it's
the mass of the entire atom.

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,890
And just so you know-- we're
delving into a little bit of

53
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,870
chemistry here-- but most of
the mass of an atom is the

54
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,410
protons and the neutrons.

55
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,290
The neutrons and the protons
weigh roughly the same thing,

56
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,120
and then the electrons are
much, much, much smaller.

57
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,110
If you factor in the mass of the
protons and the neutrons,

58
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,090
you pretty much have the
mass of the particle.

59
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,130
Just a little more chemistry
here is that although on

60
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,769
average most of the most of
the atoms have roughly the

61
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,970
same number of protons and
neutrons-- some don't.

62
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,630
Some, you could have a carbon
atom that has seven neutrons,

63
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,910
another one with five, another
one with six, and those are

64
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,260
actually all called isotopes,
and I won't go into all of

65
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,560
that-- they're just
the same atom with

66
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,350
different numbers of neutrons.

67
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:47,260
In general, the atomic mass is
equal to the mass of the

68
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,560
protons and the neutrons, and
they tend to be equal.

69
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,570
So if the atomic number
is 6, the atomic

70
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,400
mass tends to be 12.

71
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,220
So why is this useful?

72
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:09,390
We can say if we have niobium--
let's say I have a

73
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,870
mole of niobium.

74
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,400
If we look here on the periodic
table, it has an

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,840
atomic mass number of 41, and
its average atomic mass-- if

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,770
we were to average all of the
isotopes based on the

77
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,070
weighting of how they exist
in nature-- it's

78
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,920
92.9, so roughly 93.

79
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,860
It's actually a little bit more
than double its atomic

80
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,600
number, but let's say 93.

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,746
If we had a mole of niobium--
if we had 6.022 times 10 to

82
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:48,700
the 23 of niobium, it would
have a mass of 92 grams.

83
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,560
That's pretty easy-- look
at any element.

84
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,570
   

85
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:00,060
Let's say chromium: we see its
atomic mass number is roughly

86
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,860
52, and we see that there.

87
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,530
If I have a mole of it-- if I
have roughly 6 times 10 the 23

88
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,380
three of it, that much will
have a mass of 52 grams.

89
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,800
That's how we think
about a mole.

90
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,930
If I tell you I have a mole of
something, I'm also telling

91
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,550
you how many of that molecule
I have, and I'm also telling

92
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,470
you what the mass of that mole
that quantity will be,

93
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,550
assuming that you
have a periodic

94
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,720
table in front of you.

95
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,030
With that said, and with that
out of the way, let's make

96
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,110
some more progress with
our thermodynamics.

97
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:37,250
   

98
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:43,990
We said in the last several
videos that pressure times

99
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,900
volume is somehow
proportional--

100
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,870
let's call that K.

101
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,530
And this is an arbitrary number,
it's not some special

102
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,995
constant-- to the total kinetic
energy of a system.

103
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:01,560
   

104
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:10,590
We also said that that is
roughly proportional-- that's

105
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:18,540
another constant-- times the
number of molecules we have

106
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,910
times the temperature, because
temperature we viewed as

107
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,960
kinetic energy per molecule.

108
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,640
In general, we could also say
that this is proportional to

109
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,060
this, which is proportional to
this, that pressure times

110
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,100
volume is proportional.

111
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,550
We'll use R, because you'll see
where that's coming from

112
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,730
in a second.

113
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,160
It's proportional, it's equal
to some constant times the

114
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,360
number of molecules n.

115
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,150
Here I just take the absolute
numbers-- if I had five

116
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,990
molecules, I'd put a five here,
but now this n, I'm

117
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,240
counting in moles.

118
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,670
   

119
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,110
If this n is 1, that means that
I have 6.022 times 10 to

120
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,490
the 23 molecules.

121
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:11,480
One mole equals 6.022 times 10
to the 23, so I'm just saying

122
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,590
that this is another way to
write the number of molecules,

123
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,840
and then that's times
temperature.

124
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,200
   

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,910
Then if we rearrange
it-- PV equals nRT.

126
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,340
We have a relationship, that
if I know the pressure, the

127
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,750
volume, and the number of
molecules, I can figure out

128
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,230
the temperature, or if I know
the number of molecules, the

129
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,630
temperature, and the pressure,
I can figure out the volume,

130
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,460
assuming I know what R is.

131
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,799
I'm about to tell you
what that is.

132
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:46,230
R is called the universal gas
constant, and it is R is 8.31

133
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:53,030
joules per mole-Kelvin.

134
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,210
   

135
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,140
That kind of tells you what
you need in this formula.

136
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,260
This should end up being
joules, so if you have

137
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,930
pressure in pascals and volume
in meters cubed, you'll end up

138
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,050
with joules there.

139
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,065
This should be in moles--
this is 8.31 joules per

140
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:15,740
mole-Kelvin.

141
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,080
And then this, as we always
said, should be in Kelvin.

142
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,110
Honestly, if you just memorize
two things in all of

143
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,090
thermodynamics, you'll probably
be able to do 95% of

144
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,950
problems, but you actually
should have the intuition of

145
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,980
how they work.

146
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,560
Just remember that PV over T
is equal to a constant, or

147
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,880
that if you change them, they
relate to each other in that

148
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,860
they all equal a constant, so
P1 times V1 divided by T1 is

149
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,130
equal to P2 times V2
divided by T2.

150
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,310
   

151
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,440
You also should just need to
memorize PV is equal to nRT,

152
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:00,000
where R is equal to 8.31
joules per mole Kelvin.

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,660
I know you might not have a
lot of intuition of this

154
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,580
formula yet, because I haven't
used it, but I'm going to do

155
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,450
that in the next video.

156
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,300
These are literally the two
most important things you

157
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,450
should know in thermodynamics,
and hopefully you have a

158
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,600
little intuition at this point
of what they mean.

159
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,030
See you soon.

160
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,200
