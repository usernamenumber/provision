00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:10,419
When Leonardo is emerging on his own as an artist in Florence in the late 1470s,

2
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:14,319
Florence at that time was full of very important, successful artists

3
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:21,719
Not only is there Verrocchio, but you also have people like Botticelli, Pilipino Lipi and the Pollaiuolo brothers

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,619
And so, Leonardo decides to try his luck elsewhere, outside of Florence

5
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:32,519
and he writes a letter to the Duke of Milan and in the job letter, Leonardo states all of the skills that he has.

6
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:36,518
He's trying to get hired and he's essentially trying to sell himself to the Duke of Milan

7
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:42,735
And what's very interesting about this letter - which actually survives - most of the letter is a list of Leonardo's skills

8
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:46,384
that have absolutely nothing to do with painting or sculpture.

9
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:51,919
The things that Leonardo says he can do include building forts, inventing new weapons, and so on.

10
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:58,885
And then at the very end of the letter he says, "Also, I can execute sculpture in marble, bronze, or clay...and also painting."

11
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:04,519
We think of Leonardo as a great painter and indeed that's what he was, but when we read this letter from Leonardo

12
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,460
he does not prioritize painting, and if anything it comes last in the long list of things that he can do.

13
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,494
For instance, he can invent new weapons systems. And so here's a crossbow machine,

14
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:19,978
where you see men climbing on the wheel and the crossbow would be shooting arrows out.

15
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:25,195
He's interested in saying he can design weapons of war because that's what he thinks the Duke of Milan is going to want.

16
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:28,077
When an artist would be a court artist, when he would be working for someone like a Duke,

17
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:32,377
they were responsible for many, many things. It was not just making paintings and sculptures.

18
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:37,510
They had to design weapons. And here's another one, it's almost like a tank that slices people in half.

19
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,127
He tells other things that he can do for the Duke, including irrigation things.

20
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:45,294
This is a machine that is designed to make water go uphill.

21
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:48,694
He also says that he can draw maps for military purposes,

22
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:54,611
but also for agricultural purposes. This one is from a little bit later, but it shows the same basic idea.

23
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:56,344
This is of a valley in Tuscany.

24
00:01:56,344 --> 00:02:02,795
This is the way that an artist needed to sell himself when he is looking for a job in late 15th century Italy.

25
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:07,627
Now, one other thing that Leonardo talks about in his letter was the idea of making an equestrian monument

26
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,694
for the Duke's illustrious father Franceso Sforza.

27
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:16,994
This was a project that had actually been first given to one of the Pollaiuolo brothers.

28
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:22,300
And here we see the Pollaiuolo design for the Sforza equestrian monument.

29
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,701
And this was to be probably made out of bronze, although it's not entirely certain.

30
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:32,485
And this project was never completed by the Pollaiuolo and so when Leonardo is writing his letter, he says specifically,

31
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,669
"I can carry out this project," because he knows that this is a priority of the Duke.

32
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:42,685
What it illustrates is that a work of art wasn't necessarily linked exclusively to the artist who thought it up,

33
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:51,653
but that it existed as an idea, as a project, for a patron and that various different artists could claim to execute the project,

34
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:53,153
or say that they wanted to finish it.

35
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:57,900
And so here we see Pollaiuolo's drawing and then Leonardo's early drawing for the same project as this.

36
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,826
And you can see that basically it is the same design that Pollaiuolo had, but in a slightly more

37
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:08,826
Leonardo, more energetic kind of style.
