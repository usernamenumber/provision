1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,130
In the last video, we saw that
if a vector field can be

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:12,580
written as the gradient of a
scalar field-- or another way

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,080
we could say it: this would be
equal to the partial of our big

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,060
f with respect to x times i
plus the partial of big f, our

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,100
scalar field with respect to y
times j; and I'm just writing

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,690
it in multiple ways just so you
remember what the gradient is

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,490
--but we saw that if our vector
field is the gradient of

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,780
a scalar field then we
call it conservative.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:47,825
So that tells us that f is a
conservative vector field.

11
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:50,510
   

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,140
And it also tells us, and this
was the big take away from the

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,400
last video, that the line
integral of f between two

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,900
points-- let me draw two points
here; so let me draw my

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,210
coordinates just so we know
we're on the xy plane.

16
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,780
My axes: x-axis, y-axis.

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,820
Let's say I have the point, I
have that point and that point,

18
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,620
and I have two different paths
between those two points.

19
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,190
So I have path 1, that goes
something like that, so

20
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,005
I'll call that c1 and it
goes in that direction.

21
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:30,270
   

22
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,380
And then I have, maybe in
a different shades of

23
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:38,010
green, c2 goes like that.

24
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,010
They both start here
and go to there.

25
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,520
We learned in the last video
that the line integral

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,330
is path independent
between any two points.

27
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:57,930
So in this case the line
integral along c1 of f dot dr

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,560
is going to be equal to the
line integral of c2, over the

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,870
path c2, of f dot dr. The line,
if we have a potential in

30
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,500
a region, and we may be
everywhere, then the line

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,590
integral between any two points
is independent of the path.

32
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,390
That's the neat thing about
a conservative field.

33
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,190
Now what I want to do in this
video is do a little bit of

34
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,680
an extension of the take
away of the last video.

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,710
It's actually a pretty
important extension; it might

36
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,540
already be obvious to you.

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,550
I've already written this
here; I could rearrange

38
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,410
this equation a little bit.

39
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,745
So let me do it.

40
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:35,310
So let me a rearrange this.

41
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,976
I'll just rewrite
this in orange.

42
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:42,730
So the line integral on path c1
dot dr minus-- I'll just go

43
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:48,670
subtract this from both sides
--minus the line integral c2 of

44
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,110
f dot dr is going
to be equal to 0.

45
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,610
All I did is I took this take
away from the last video and

46
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,430
I subtracted this
from both sides.

47
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:04,370
Now we learned several videos
ago that if we're dealing with

48
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,560
a line integral of a vector
field-- not a scalar field

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,690
--with a vector field,
the direction of the

50
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,090
path is important.

51
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:20,370
We learned that the line
integral over, say, c2 of f dot

52
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,580
dr, is equal to the negative of
the line integral of minus c2

53
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,830
of f dot dr where we denoted
minus c2 is the same path as

54
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,740
c2, but just in the
opposite direction.

55
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,370
So for example, minus c2 I
would write like this-- so let

56
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,440
me do it in a different color
--so let's say this is minus

57
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,740
c2, it'd be a path just like
c2-- I'm going to call this

58
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,100
minus c2 --but instead of going
in that direction, I'm now

59
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,380
going to go in that direction.

60
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,980
So ignore the old c2 arrows.

61
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,030
We're now starting from
there and coming back here.

62
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,100
So this is minus c2.

63
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,220
Or we could write, we could
put, the minus on the other

64
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,250
side and we could say that
the negative of the c2 line

65
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:13,770
integral along the path of c2
of f dot dr is equal to the

66
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:19,510
line integral over the reverse
path of f dot dr. All I did is

67
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,630
I switched the negative on
the other side; multiplied

68
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,370
both sides by negative 1.

69
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,900
So let's replace-- in this
equation we have the minus of

70
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,480
the c2 path; we have that right
there, and we have that right

71
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,880
there --so we could just
replace this with

72
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,800
this right there.

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,670
So let me do that.

74
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,670
So I'll write this
first part first.

75
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:43,410
So the integral along the curve
c1 of f dot dr, instead of

76
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:49,200
minus the line integral along
c2, I'm going to say plus the

77
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
integral along minus c2.

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,940
This-- let me switch to the
green --this we've established

79
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,480
is the same thing as this.

80
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,720
The negative of this curve, or
the line integral along this

81
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,950
path, is the same thing as the
line integral, the positive of

82
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,350
the line integral along
the reverse path.

83
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:13,610
So we'll say plus the line
integral of minus c2 of

84
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,270
f dot dr is equal to 0.

85
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,670
Now there's something
interesting.

86
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,550
Let's look at what the
combination of the path

87
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,560
of c1 and minus c2 is.

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,370
c1 starts over here.

89
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,280
Let me get a nice,
vibrant color.

90
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,580
c1 starts over here
at this point.

91
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,540
It moves from this point
along this curve c1 and

92
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,020
ends up at this point.

93
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,840
And then we do the minus c2.

94
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,590
Minus c2 starts at this point
and just goes and comes back

95
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,810
to the original point;
it completes a loop.

96
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,270
So this is a closed
line integral.

97
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,440
So if you combine this,
we could rewrite this.

98
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,660
Remember, this is just a loop.

99
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,365
By reversing this, instead of
having two guys starting here

100
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:58,450
and going there, I now can
start here, go all the way

101
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,660
there, and then come all
the way back on this

102
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,630
reverse path of c2.

103
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,880
So this is equivalent to
a closed line integral.

104
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,150
So that is the same thing as an
integral along a closed path.

105
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,730
I mean, we could call the
closed path, maybe, c1 plus

106
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,200
minus c2, if we wanted to be
particular about

107
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,900
the closed path.

108
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,390
But this could be, I drew c1
and c2 or minus c2 arbitrarily;

109
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,600
this could be any closed path
where our vector field f has a

110
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,000
potential, or where it is the
gradient of a scalar field,

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,960
or where it is conservative.

112
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,620
And so this can be written as
a closed path of c1 plus the

113
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:45,930
reverse of c2 of f dot dr.
That's just a rewriting

114
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,040
of that, and so that's
going to be equal to 0.

115
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,050
And this is our take
away for this video.

116
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,110
This is, you can view
it as a corollary.

117
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,160
It's kind of a low-hanging
conclusion that you can make

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,610
after this conclusion.

119
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,900
So now we know that if we have
a vector field that's the

120
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,570
gradient of a scalar field in
some region, or maybe over the

121
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,440
entire xy plane-- and this is
called the potential of f;

122
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,320
this is a potential function.

123
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,370
Oftentimes it will be the
negative of it, but it's easy

124
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,670
to mess with negatives --but if
we have a vector field that is

125
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,650
the gradient of a scalar field,
we call that vector

126
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,100
field conservative.

127
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,880
That tells us that at any point
in the region where this is

128
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,860
valid, the line integral from
one point to another is

129
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,150
independent of the path; that's
what we got from

130
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,130
the last video.

131
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,890
And because of that, a closed
loop line integral, or a closed

132
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,570
line integral, so if we take
some other place, if we take

133
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:52,915
any other closed line integral
or we take the line integral of

134
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:57,490
the vector field on any closed
loop, it will become 0 because

135
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,740
it is path independent.

136
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,240
So that's the neat take away
here, that if you know that

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,370
this is conservative, if you
ever see something like this:

138
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:10,580
if you see this f dot dr and
someone asks you to evaluate

139
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,840
this given that f is
conservative, or given that f

140
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,710
is the gradient of another
function, or given that f is

141
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,960
path independent, you can now
immediately say, that is going

142
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,170
to be equal to 0, which
simplifies the math a good bit.

143
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,466
