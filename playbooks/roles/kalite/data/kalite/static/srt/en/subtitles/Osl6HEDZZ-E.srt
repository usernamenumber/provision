1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,220
   

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,480
I think it makes sense to keep
doing a few more problems just

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,620
so you really get intimately
comfortable with PV equals

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,950
nRT, or the ideal
gas equation.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:15,240
So we have 98 milliliters
of an unknown gas.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,980
   

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,750
They say weighs in the problem,
but I'll use mass.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,130
Its mass is 0.081 grams. You
shouldn't say weighs 0.081

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,170
grams. This is mass.

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,950
Weight would be in newtons if
we're in the metric system at

11
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,870
standard temperature
and pressure.

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,740
Calculate the molar
mass of the gas.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,670
So they want to know
the mass per mole.

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:49,750
So the molar mass, or
the mass per mole.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,540
Now, we could just substitute
this into PV is equal to nRT.

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,760
We know what standard
temperature and pressure are.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,220
Standard temperature is
273 degrees Kelvin.

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,410
Standard pressure
is 1 atmosphere.

19
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,940
   

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,220
And then, of course, they're
giving us 98 milliliters.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,295
And then you can just solve for
how many moles we have.

22
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:21,730
And actually, maybe
I'll do that.

23
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,210
But the other way to think about
it is that at standard

24
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,010
temperature and pressure, an
ideal gas-- and we did this

25
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:27,900
two videos ago.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,600
We said 1 mole of an ideal gas
at standard temperature and

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,770
pressure will fill up a
volume of 22.4 liters.

28
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,750
And I'm normally not a big fan
of memorizing things, but this

29
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,160
might be something handy to
memorize if you want to get

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,400
through your chemistry test
fast. But you can always

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,180
derive this if you know what
standard temperature and

32
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,720
pressure is by PV equals nRT.

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,390
But if you know that 1 mole is
going to take up that much

34
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:03,650
space, so one mole is to 22.4
liters, as how many moles,

35
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,430
let's say x moles in
this question.

36
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,490
We want to figure out how many
moles of the gas we have and

37
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,140
we know we are at 98
milliliters, so 0.098, so we

38
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,270
set up this proportional
equation and we could figure

39
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,060
out how many moles we're
dealing with.

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,240
If 1 mole takes up 22.4 liters,
then our number of

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,030
moles are going to take up
0.098, and this is an ideal

42
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,900
gas in both circumstances.

43
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:34,250
So we could say 22.4x
is equal to 0.098.

44
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:40,630
And then we have x is equal
to 0.098 divided by 22.4.

45
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,310
And this, of course,
is in moles.

46
00:02:43,310 --> 00:03:05,480
So 0.098 divided by 22.4 is
equal to 0.004375 moles.

47
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,540
And they're telling us that
this amount has a mass of

48
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,520
0.081 grams. So let
me get the number.

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,030
So how many grams are
there per mole?

50
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,390
So we take 0.081 grams and we
just did the math to figure

51
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,950
out that we're dealing
with 0.004375 moles.

52
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,140
So how many grams do
we have per mole?

53
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,610
Let's take the calculator out.

54
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:50,530
So we have 0.081 divided by
0.004375 is equal to 18.51.

55
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:58,840
So it's equals 18.5
grams per mole.

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,460
   

57
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,330
So now this is an interesting
question.

58
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,450
So we figured out the molar mass
of our mystery substance

59
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,680
that took up 98 milliliters and
had a mass of 0.081 grams

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,160
at standard temperature and
pressure, and we figured out

61
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,170
its molar mass, or its mass per
mole, is 18.5 grams. So

62
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,700
any guess as to what molecule
we're dealing with?

63
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,630
18.5 grams.

64
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,990
And probably it's not going to
be exact, but at least in my

65
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,680
brain, water seems to
be a good candidate.

66
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,390
Water is H20.

67
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,370
Maybe I should do it in blue
because it's water.

68
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,030
   

69
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,260
The mass of each
hydrogen is 1.

70
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,700
Remember, hydrogen, at least
in its most standard form,

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,610
doesn't have a neutron, so it's
really just a proton and

72
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,810
and an electron, so it has an
atomic mass of 1 or a molar

73
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,290
mass of 1 gram.

74
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,700
And oxygen has a molar mass of
16 grams. So you have two

75
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,720
hydrogens, so it's 2 plus
16 is equal to 18.

76
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,970
So it looks like our mystery
substance is water.

77
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,939
