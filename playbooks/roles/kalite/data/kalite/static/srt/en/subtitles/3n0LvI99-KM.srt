1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,350
So we're told that quadrilateral ABCD is a square

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,220
which tells us that the 4 sides have equal length,

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,590
and that they are all the interior angles are 90 degrees

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:18,020
We also know that FG,FG is a perpendicular bisector of BC

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,200
so we've already shown that it's perpendicular,

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,450
that this a 90-degree angle, but it also bisects BC

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,070
So this length is equal to that length right over there

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,640
Then they tell us that arc AC, it's a curve on top,

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,770
arc AC is part of circle B

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,060
So this is a circle centered at B

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,810
So this is the center of the circle,

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,280
this is part of part of that circle

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,170
It's really kind of the bottom left corner of that circle

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,230
and then given that information, they want us

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,060
to find what the measure of angle BED is

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,130
So what is BED?

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,730
So it's BED

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,310
So we need to figure out the measure

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,630
of this angle right over here

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,460
And I encourage you to pause it and try it out

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,490
And you might imagine, well I you could pause it

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,560
and try it without any hints

23
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,380
and now I would give you a hint if you if you try it the first time,

24
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,320
and you weren't able to do it,

25
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,900
and you should pause it again after this hint, is,

26
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,260
try to draw some triangles that maybe split up this angle

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,710
into a couple of different angles

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,990
and that might be a little bit easier

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,620
You might be able to use some of what we know about triangles

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,750
Now that said, I will try to solve it

31
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,460
and you should pause at any point

32
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,050
where you think that you know exactly how to do this

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,750
and try to do this yourself

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,590
So the trick is to realize that this is a circle

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,860
and so any any line that goes between B

36
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,330
and any point on this arc

37
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,460
is going to be equal to the radius of the circle

38
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,580
So AB is equal to the radius of the circle

39
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,300
BE is equal to the radius of the circle

40
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,900
And we can keep drawing other things

41
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,520
that are equal to the radius of the circle

42
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,640
BC is equal to the radius of the circle

43
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,050
So let's think about it a little bit

44
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,070
If we were to draw, and a lot of trickier geometry problems

45
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,530
really all revolve around drawing the right lines

46
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,450
or or visualizing the right triangles, and I'll do one right here

47
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,630
that might open up a lot for you in terms of thinking

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,340
about how to do this problem

49
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,940
So let me draw segment EC

50
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,700
and draw that as straight as possible

51
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,010
I can draw a better job of that

52
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,630
So the segment EC

53
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,460
Now something becomes interesting

54
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,420
because what is what is the relationship

55
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,990
between EBG and triangle ECG?

56
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,470
Well they both definitely share, they both share

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,590
this side right over here

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,610
They both share side EG

59
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,440
And then BG is equal to GC

60
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,890
And they both have 90 degree angles

61
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,150
They have 90 degree angle here

62
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,910
and they have 90 degree angle there

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,380
So you see by side angle side

64
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,420
Side angle side, these 2 triangles are going to be congruent

65
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:56,580
So we know that triangle EBG is congruent to triangle ECG

66
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,230
ECG, I should emphasize the C not the E

67
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,650
ECG by side angle side congruency,

68
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,280
by side angel side congruency

69
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,280
And that also tells that all of the corresponding angles

70
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,560
and sides are going to be the same

71
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,090
So, that tells us, that tells us right there

72
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,010
that EC that EC is equal to EB,

73
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,580
EC is equal to EB

74
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,480
So we know that EB, EB is equal to EC,

75
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,800
and what is what also is equal to that length?

76
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,000
Once again, this is the radius of the circle

77
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,030
BE, is one radius of the circle going from the center to the arc

78
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,700
But so is BC

79
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,600
It is also a radius of the circle going from the center to the arc

80
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,780
So this is also equal to, this is also equal to BC

81
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,430
So I could draw this other other 3 things right here

82
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,080
I'm I'm referring to the entire thing

83
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:54,990
not just one of the segments

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,380
All of BC

85
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,070
So what is, what kind of a triangle is this right over here?

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,160
Triangle BEC

87
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,660
Triangle BEC is equilateral

88
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,550
Equilateral

89
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,450
And we know that because all 3 sides are equal

90
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,090
So that tells us that all of its angles are equal

91
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,070
So that tells us that the measure of angle BEC, BEC,

92
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,430
we're not done yet, but it gets us close, is 60 degrees

93
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,260
So the measure of angle BEC right over there is 60 degrees

94
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,800
So that gives us part of the problem

95
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,040
BEC is part of the angle BED

96
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,680
If we can just figure out the measure of angle CED now,

97
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,520
if we can figure out this angle right over here,

98
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,020
we just add that to 60 degrees and we're done

99
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,920
We figured out the entire the entire BED

100
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,570
Let's think about how we can do this right over here

101
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,810
So there's a couple of interesting things

102
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,370
that we already do know

103
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,160
We know that this right over here

104
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,370
is equal to the radius of the circle

105
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,190
And we also know that this length down here,

106
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,120
this is a square

107
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,300
We know that this length down here

108
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,990
is the same as this length up here

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,380
That these are the exact same length,

110
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,020
and this is equal to the radius of the circle

111
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,500
We already put these 3 slashes here

112
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,630
BC is the same as that length, is the same as that length,

113
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,700
so all 4 sides are gonna be the same as that length

114
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,020
because this is a square

115
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,470
So let me write, let me write this down

116
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,920
Because because it's a square, I'll just write it this way

117
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,530
Because it's a square, we know that CD, we know that cd

118
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,960
is equal to BC which is equal to,

119
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,270
and we already established this as equal to CEC

120
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,040
which is equal to EB, which is equal to EC

121
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,700
What's important here is to realize that this and this

122
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,800
are the same length

123
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,000
And the reason why that is interesting

124
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,180
is it let's us know that this is an isosceles triangle

125
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,880
It's an isosceles triangle

126
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,130
So whatever isosceles triangle, if you have your 2 legs of it,

127
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,260
the 2 base angles are going to be congruent

128
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,120
So whatever angle this green angle is,

129
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,960
this angle is going to be as well

130
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,930
So somehow, somehow,

131
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,160
we can figure out this angle right over here

132
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,290
We can subtract that from 180

133
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,470
and then divide by 2 to figure out these 2

134
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,520
because we know that they are the same

135
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,050
So how can we figure out this angle?

136
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,770
Well we know all the angles of these things off up,

137
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,230
we can figure out all the angles of the larger ones up here

138
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,170
We know that this is an equilateral triangle

139
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,250
So this over here has to be 60 degrees as well

140
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,410
That's 60 degrees, and that is also 60 degrees

141
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,530
In fact, I can write it over here,

142
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,570
which is equal to the angle of BCE

143
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:38,600
The measure of angle BCE, BCE

144
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,680
So this is 60 degrees, we know we are dealing with a square

145
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,040
So this whole angle over here is a right angle

146
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,430
What is the measure of angle ECD?

147
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
What is this angle right over here?

148
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,130
I'm using a new color

149
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,990
This angle over here is gonna have to be 30 degrees

150
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,460
So that is going to be 30 degrees

151
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,150
And now, we are ready to solve

152
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,750
If you know, now we are ready to solve for these 2 base angles

153
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,230
If we call this x, if you call this x,

154
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,140
and we know they have to be the same,

155
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,410
we have x + x + 30 degrees,

156
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,710
x + x + 30 degrees is going to be equal to 180 degrees

157
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,320
That is the sum of all the interior angles of a triangle

158
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,080
So you get 2x,

159
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:25,350
2x + 30, + 30 is equal to 180 degrees

160
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,880
Now you can subtract 30 from both sides,

161
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:33,120
and we are left with 2x is equal to 150

162
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,270
Divide both sides by 2, you get x = 75

163
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,540
So we figured that x = 75, and now we are at the home stretch

164
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,300
We have to figure out angle BED

165
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,180
Well, that's going to be angle C,

166
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,820
so x is equal to the measure of angle CED,

167
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:57,330
so BED is CED + CED + BEC

168
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,760
So the 60 degrees + 75 degrees

169
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,070
So it's going to be,

170
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,840
ready for the drum roll?

171
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,860
This is going to be equal to 75 degrees + 60 degrees

172
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,480
which is equal to 135 degrees

173
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,470
And we are done
