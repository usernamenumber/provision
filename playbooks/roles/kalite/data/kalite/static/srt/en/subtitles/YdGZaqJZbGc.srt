1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,470
Let's think about 2 different scenarios

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,402
where I might borrow money from you,

3
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:08,521
So this is me over here, and this is you

4
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:11,225
in the first scenario, I borrow money from you

5
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:13,459
for a relatively short amount of time,

6
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:19,474
so I'm gonna borrow $100 from you

7
00:00:19,474 --> 00:00:25,919
and then in 1 week I will pay that $100 back to you

8
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:29,412
I will pay back the $100, and then I will pay

9
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:33,979
some interest. And we'll calculate the interest

10
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:36,777
on an annual basis, but obviously it will be less than

11
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:38,715
a year's interest because I'm only paying for a week

12
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:41,102
but we can annualize it, it would give us some

13
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:45,835
annual interest. The other scenarios is I borrow for a longer period of time

14
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:48,456
So I'll do the other scenario in pink right over here

15
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:51,688
So let's say I borrow $100. Instead of paying you back

16
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:56,679
in a week, we agree that I can pay you back in 2 years.

17
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:04,710
I'm going to pay you back $100 plus some interest.

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,712
And what I want to think about here is there any reason

19
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:10,938
why on an annual basis, I should have a different interest rate

20
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:14,441
for the short-term borrowing than the long-term borrowing

21
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,069
You might say, "Look, it's the same guy that's borrowing,

22
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:19,869
"...has the same credit rating, has the same kind of legitimacy"

23
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:22,761
and all of that, but you would say, "Well look,

24
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:26,835
"...over here in 1 week, there's less of a chance of something catastrophic happening"

25
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:29,287
There's more predictability here,

26
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:33,002
you have a better sense of what the world 1 week from now

27
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:34,690
is going to look like, than you do 2 years

28
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,818
maybe 2 years from now we enter into a hyper-inflationary environment

29
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:39,719
maybe I get hit by a truck, maybe I lose a job

30
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,216
there's a lot more that can happen in 2 years

31
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:44,587
than can happen in 1 week.

32
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:48,689
And so you say, "Look, I think that this loan right here is riskier"

33
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,584
and it's not always the case that this would happen

34
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:54,472
but many times you'd say look, if lending it for longer it's riskier

35
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:58,518
there's more uncertainty, so on an annual basis

36
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:07,855
I would charge higher interest, on an annual basis.

37
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:10,460
Maybe in this scenario up here, you say

38
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,019
"Look, I'll charge you 5% per year interest"

39
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:16,950
So obviously the interest I would pay after a week

40
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,697
would be some fraction of this, some small fraction of $5 or 5%

41
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:25,517
and over here, since there's more risk, more uncertainty over 2 years

42
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:31,690
I will charge you, or you will charge me I should say, 10% per year.

43
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,714
And it's not always the case, that the longer maturity debt

44
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:37,658
is going to have a higher interest,

45
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,554
although it tends to be the case. If it goes lower

46
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:41,654
we'll talk about it in a future video, it actually shows

47
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,758
that something bad might be happening in the economy

48
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:47,305
or we might somehow be entering into a deflationary period

49
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:49,327
But the whole point of this video is to show you that

50
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:52,623
depending upon how long someone borrows money from someone else,

51
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:56,707
they might want to charge a different amount of interest per year

52
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:59,271
depending on perceived risk,

53
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:03,246
the same thing is true when people lend to corporations

54
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:05,054
or to the Federal Government.

55
00:03:05,054 --> 99:59:59,999
What we're going to see in the next video is how that plays out in the yield curve.
