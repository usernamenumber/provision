1
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:10,280
Around 600 BC lived Thales of Miletus,

2
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,977
widely regarded
as the first Greek philosopher,

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,058
as he was the first to give a purely natural
explanation of the phenomena he observed.

4
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:27,140
A key observation he made was
that certain stones –

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,269
such as amber – when rubbed against fur,

6
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,002
would exhibit a strange property.

7
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:35,624
The amber seemed to emit an invisible force

8
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:37,967
which would attract small fibers.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,244
He assumed this rendered the amber magnetic,

10
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,155
another force he observed
when playing with lodestones,

11
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,800
which are naturally occurring magnets.

12
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,547
Many after him observed
that contact or friction

13
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:56,292
with fur seemed to create an imbalance.

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,023
Something was pulled from the fur

15
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:00,597
and transferred onto other objects.

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,266
Now, not only did this result in
a small attractive or repulsive force,

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,088
but also in the potential
for shocks to occur.

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,688
Once the discharge occurred,
the force disappeared.

19
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:16,533
So the shock was some form of discharge

20
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:20,155
which reversed the imbalance
created by the friction.

21
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,088
Throughout history, we were also
fascinated with lighting bolts –

22
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:30,998
nature's most passionate displays
of power and aggression.

23
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:35,664
Most cultures assumed this was a divine force,
outside the reach of human hands,

24
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,488
and was therefore reserved for the gods.

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,577
Up until the 17th century, our descriptions of it
varied from an invisible, intangible, imponderable agent –

26
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:51,688
or even threads of syrup
which elongate and contract.

27
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,350
And it was Benjamin Franklin who, in 1752,
set out to prove that there was a connection

28
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,689
between lightning and these
tiny shocks due to friction

29
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,187
In a famously dangerous experiment,
done alone with his son,

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,911
he led a kite into a thunderstorm.

31
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,800
And near the the bottom,
where the thread was wet,

32
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,022
he tied an iron key.

33
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:19,000
And after some time, he brought
his knuckle up to the key,

34
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:21,650
and experienced a series of small shocks --

35
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:25,733
identical to the ones created
by contact with fur.

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,377
This showed that, indeed, lightning was simply
the same thing as these household shocks,

37
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,644
but on a massive scale.

38
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:37,706
And at this time, people had begun
to divide materials into two categories.

39
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:43,341
One were objects which would allow
or accept discharge such as gold or copper

40
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,377
which we call 'electrical conductors.'

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,288
And interestingly, these materials are also
generally good at conducting heat.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,866
Number 2 were objects which would
not allow this discharge –

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,866
such as rubber – or electrical 'insulators'.

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,133
These materials also seem to
insulate the transfer of heat.

45
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:09,666
And we also began trying to measure
this force that Thales had encountered.

46
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:13,890
One way to do this was to suspend
a piece of spongy plant,

47
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:16,470
called a pith ball, by a thread.

48
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:20,644
And when we rubbed an insulator against fur
and brought it near the pith ball,

49
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,666
it would pull on it,
causing a deflection.

50
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:34,822
If we added more objects,
we noticed this deflection increased

51
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,666
due to a greater pulling force.

52
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:46,711
We also noticed that the shape
of insulators made a difference.

53
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,488
Large, thin insulators seemed
to exhibit a much stronger force.

54
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:02,926
And amazingly, it was found that conductors
such as copper wire

55
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:06,600
would transmit this pulling
effect over a distance.

56
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,475
This was demonstrated
by running a long wire

57
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:12,366
between the pith ball
and the charged insulator.

58
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,043
When the object was brought near the wire,

59
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:20,339
it pulled through the wire

60
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,555
and deflected the pith ball instantly.

61
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:26,525
When we later touch the wire with our finger,

62
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,000
a discharge occurs and the pulling stops
and the ball is released.

63
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:33,406
Immediately, people began speculating

64
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:37,580
that this could be the future
of optical telegraphs.

65
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:42,010
And in 1774, French inventor
George-Louis Le Sage,

66
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:45,560
was one of the first on record
to actually set up this idea.

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,866
He sent messages through
an array of 26 wires –

68
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:52,200
each wire representing
a letter of the alphabet.

69
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,511
When a discharge occurred at one end,
the pith ball would move at the other.

70
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:58,420
The trouble with this telegraph

71
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,511
was that it only extended between
the 2 rooms of his house.

72
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,955
The power of the deflection was small
and difficult to work with.

73
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,311
Though at the time, people were investigating
techniques for generating larger charge differences,

74
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,888
in order to amplify the force involved.

75
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:17,420
One improvement, popularized
by Alessandro Volta 1 year later,

76
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:21,650
was an easy way of generating
discharges on demand.

77
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:24,720
It was based on the idea
that a charged insulator

78
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:29,488
could induce or transfer a charge
onto a nearby conducting plate.

79
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:33,066
One needed to merely bring
the metal plate close to the insulator

80
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:36,555
which would pull on the charge
distribution in the metal plate,

81
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,622
resulting in an imbalance,
or electrical 'tension', in the metal plate.

82
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:44,577
Then one could bring their finger
to the plate, and a discharge would occur.

83
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:48,111
Then the plate is pulled away,
using an insulating handle,

84
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,266
and an excess charge would remain
trapped in the plate.

85
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:57,422
The plate could then be discharged at will,
simply by touching it to a conductor such as a finger.

86
00:05:57,555 --> 00:06:03,155
And amazingly, this process can be repeated many times
without recharging the insulating plate.

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,666
We could then generate
many small discharges at will.

88
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:10,671
And by now, Benjamin Franklin
was focused on finding out how to trap –

89
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:13,020
or store up these discharges.

90
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,733
At this time, he still assumed that electricity
was some sort of invisible fluid,

91
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,044
since he knew it could
travel through water.

92
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:25,794
So he assumed that water inside an insulator
could hold electricity.

93
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:30,432
What we now call the 'Leyden jar'
was a glass jar with water inside,

94
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,688
and a metal probe running out the top.

95
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:36,741
Franklin also wrapped the outside
in a conductive metal.

96
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,422
When he brought a charged conductor
towards the top probe,

97
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:46,370
a discharge would occur
and stay trapped in the jar.

98
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,933
More importantly, was that the jar
could be charged multiple times.

99
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:54,420
Each spark would amplify
the charge separation –

100
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:57,090
or electrical tension – inside the jar.

101
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:59,890
A good analogy is
to think of the jar as a balloon,

102
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,270
and each discharge as a short jolt of water.

103
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,910
And after hundreds of iterations,

104
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:08,180
the tension becomes massive.

105
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:19,070
And to release the charge, he simply touched
the outside conductor to the top probe.

106
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:24,596
A large discharge occurred.

107
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,177
Franklin improved the design over time,

108
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,355
eventually realizing that the charge
was not stored in the water – but the glass.

109
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:36,662
The water was merely a conductive path
from the probe to the jar.

110
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:39,533
Today, we would call
the Leyden jar a 'capacitor'

111
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:41,506
or 'charge-storing device.'

112
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,700
And when he chained many jars together,

113
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:48,950
he found he could increase the capacity even more
and release deadly bolts of electricity.

114
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:53,169
And over the years, people focused on
more effective ways of building up charge –

115
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,980
using friction machines –

116
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,466
which could then be stored in capacitors

117
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,977
and released as spectacular displays
of man-made lightning.

118
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:24,666
And over the next 50 years,

119
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:30,434
people tried to design systems
for sending sparks across greater distances,

120
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:34,080
using longer wires
and more powerful discharges.

121
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:40,317
However, sending electrostatic discharges
as a communication method

122
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:47,099
seemed clumsy, archaic, and was no improvement
over the existing optical telegraphs of the day.

123
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,511
They were widely ignored
by government and industry.

124
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,822
Though the tides were rising.

125
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,620
An electric revolution
was just around the corner.
