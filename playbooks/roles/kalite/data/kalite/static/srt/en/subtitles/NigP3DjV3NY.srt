00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,399
[piano music]

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,539
We're on the second floor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:14,715
and we're looking at a painting by Degas: "The Dance Class".

4
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:19,963
This is a painting that was, according to the wall text, originally intended

5
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:23,632
for the first Impressionist Exhibition in 1874

6
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:26,372
but not actually shown until two years later.

7
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:31,408
Thinking about that very first Impressionist Exhibition,

8
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:34,098
the first moment when this scoop of artists decided

9
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:36,792
"we're not going to show at the Salon,

10
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:39,224
we're going to create our own exhibition space",

11
00:00:39,224 --> 00:00:43,374
and how incredibly normal that seems to us today.

12
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:44,396
But it was radical...

13
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:47,879
Completely radical... to not show in the official exhibition.

14
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,826
Didn't they actually borrow the photographer's studio, Nadar,

15
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:52,987
on the Boulevard des Capucines?

16
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:56,656
They did, but there was real concern that not enough people would come to see it,

17
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,303
they wouldn't become known, they wouldn't become famous,

18
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:01,811
no one would buy their work, how would they eat...

19
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:06,733
Because if they showed their work at the official exhibition at the Salon...

20
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,662
Everybody would.

21
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:09,566
But I think we know who the Impressionists are.

22
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,891
They were fairly successful.

23
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:13,513
They did the right thing in the end.

24
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:17,043
There were some really hilarious... some positive reviews and some really

25
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:21,547
scathingly sarcastic reviews of that first Impressionist exhibition.

26
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:24,195
This is a pretty outrageous painting.

27
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:26,377
It doesn't look so outrageous to us now, does it?

28
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,910
No, it looks beautiful to us.

29
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,885
It's like a snapshot.

30
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:33,622
This woman in the center whose body comes out of the two heads

31
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:35,712
of these other two standing women.

32
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:37,894
She seems to have her fingers in her mouth.

33
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:42,120
It's interesting that despite the fact that we assume right off

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,792
that the ballerinas are beautiful and graceful,

35
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:46,811
many of the ballerinas, if not all of them,

36
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,854
with the exception of the one who's performing,

37
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:52,012
are really rendered in a very ungainly way.

38
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:55,402
Actually she looks pretty ungainly herself.

39
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:58,607
You can see what's happening. This is a little narrative here.

40
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:00,929
You have the dancers waiting their turn,

41
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:03,251
the dance master, the male with the staff,

42
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:05,665
and the one dancer who's moving across the floor

43
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:07,430
and the young women who have finished.

44
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:13,142
And the mirror they're practising in front of,

45
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:17,693
that gives us a sense of the window that must be outside of the painting

46
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:18,901
on the right side...

47
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:21,130
It's illuminating. You can see the city through it...

48
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:26,099
And this is really all about this new urban world, this culture of pleasure.

49
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,839
The city of performance and leisure.

50
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:32,972
These women who are in the back, just hanging out

51
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:35,758
and sitting around, with their hands on their hips...

52
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:38,498
Those might actually be the escorts, right?

53
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:40,588
Because older ones not in tutus are their mothers.

54
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:45,761
The ballerinas were the movie stars of today.

55
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:50,400
Even if with that little bit of that risquÃ© element involved.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,834
The notion of the ungainliness is so clear when you look for it.

57
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:58,782
Look at the dancer who is in the very foreground, just at the back of the music stand.

58
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:00,779
She looks as if she's hiking her tutu.

59
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:05,108
And the woman behind her, fixing something about her tutu...

60
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:08,859
You're right. And the other one has her fingers in her mouth,

61
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:10,113
she's biting her nails.

62
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:12,156
And we can't see the bottom of her body at all.

63
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:15,872
Her torso seems to grow out of these three heads,

64
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:18,937
of these three figures in the front.

65
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:23,255
Another figure on the left looks out at something

66
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:24,881
outside of the picture.

67
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:28,364
This is not a self-contained, clear narrative,

68
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:31,708
which is exactly what would have been presented at the Salon.

69
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,937
It completely breaks all the compositional rules...

70
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:36,161
And narrative...

71
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,672
There's something intensely modern about this notion of an image that

72
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:45,666
seems so momentary and so unchoreographed.

73
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:50,031
But, of course, we know that it was graphed by Degas

74
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,231
and carefully planned in structure...

75
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:55,300
A perfect metaphor for the subject.

76
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:59,835
The way that the perspective of the room is exaggerated,

77
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:06,522
this very asymmetrical thing that Degas does very often. The whole bottom right at the corner is empty.

78
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:07,683
And look at what that does.

79
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:10,516
You have this incredible velocity of the perspective,

80
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,281
especially in terms of the ceiling line.

81
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:15,253
But then you're right, the bottom right is completely empty

82
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:20,234
and it's doing a kind of East-Asian or Japanese... asymmetry.

83
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:23,258
Not only asymmetry but also creating a kind of flat plain.

84
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:24,558
Absolutely.

85
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:29,481
In a sense very much at odds with the velocity of this tension that develops

86
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,617
between the two-dimensionality of the bottom right

87
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:35,362
and the hyper three-dimensionality of the upper left.

88
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:39,871
There's this other issue. We are here viewing something

89
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,791
that is very intimate and very spontaneous.

90
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:45,716
That people wouldn't be allowed to see...

91
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:48,595
Or we do have the privilege of the dance master.

92
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:55,903
We're really about at his eye level and we are another sort of viewer... we have that...

93
00:04:55,903 --> 00:05:00,176
Insiders... It's like having backstage tickets.

94
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,988
Except that they don't notice us.

95
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:03,612
No, they don't notice us at all.
