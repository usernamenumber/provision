00:00:00,964 --> 00:00:02,267
What I want to do in this video is

2
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:03,898
explore what happens when we get to

3
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:06,195
really, really, really small scales.

4
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:07,575
Before we even think about it,

5
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,800
I want to familiarize ourselves

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,533
with the units here.

7
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:15,504
So, we're all familiar with what a meter looks like

8
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:18,506
(the average adult male is a little under 2 meters).

9
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:21,711
If you were to divide a meter into a thousand units,

10
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:22,872
you would get a millimeter.

11
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:24,961
I think we probably know what a millimeter is

12
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,355
if you've ever looked at a meter stick

13
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:29,791
it's the smallest measurement on that meter stick,

14
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,299
so it's already pretty hard to look at.

15
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,067
Now if you were to divide each of those millimeters into a thousand sections,

16
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,471
you'd get a micrometer,

17
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,400
or another way to think about a micrometer

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,231
is [that] it's one millionth of a meter,

19
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,400
so this is kind of beyond

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,000
what we're capable of really perceiving.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,200
If you were to take each of those micrometers

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,667
and divide them into a thousand sections,

23
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,287
you would get a nanometer,

24
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,877
so now we're one billionth of a meter.

25
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:59,000
[If] you divide that by a thousand,

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,200
a picometer, so a picometer is

27
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,133
one thousand billionth of a meter,

28
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,133
or you could say a trillionth of a meter.

29
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,733
You divide one of those by a thousand

30
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,056
and you would get a femtometer,

31
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:16,195
so these are unimaginably small things.

32
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:17,779
Now once you're familiar with the units,

33
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:20,595
let's explore what types of things we can

34
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:22,929
expect to find at these different scales.

35
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:24,154
And I'll start over here,

36
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:26,164
and I've written them on the left as well,

37
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:28,400
but it's more compelling when you see the pictures.

38
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:31,133
We'll start over here with the bee

39
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:34,979
and I've arbitrarily picked something of this scale,

40
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,298
there's many, many, many, [an] almost infinite

41
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,595
number of things I could've picked at this scale.

42
00:01:39,595 --> 00:01:42,610
But the average bee is about 2 centimeters long

43
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,862
(this bee right over here)

44
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:47,800
it's about, give or take, one hundredth
