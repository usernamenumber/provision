99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
PROBLEM: “The circle, x^2 + y^2 - 8x = 0,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the hyperbola, (x^2/9) – (y^2/4) = 1,

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
intersect at the points a and b.”

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In Problem 46, they tell us the equation –

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or they want to find the equation of the circle

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with ab as its diameter.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let’s think about –

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's visualize the circle and the hyperbola.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The equation of the circle, x^2 + y^2 - 8x = 0 …

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(Let me write it this way.)

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This can be rewritten as x^2 - 8x + y^2 = 0.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can add 16 to both sides.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I’m doing that to complete the square for the x term.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So plus 16/

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This over here becomes (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, the circle’s going to look something like this.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's my x axis.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's my y axis.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's center is at 4, 0.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4, 0.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And It's radius is 4.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its radius squared is 16.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So its radius is 4.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me go 1, 2, 3, 4.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1, 2, 3, 4.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me go up four:

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1, 2, 3, 4.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, all of these points –

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that point, that point, that point, and that point –

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are all going to be on the circle.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(Let me draw that a little bit neater.)

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That point, that point, and that point

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are all going to be on our circle.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So my circle’s going to look something like this.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's not drawn as neatly as it could be,

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but I think you get the general idea.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is our circle.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then they have a hyperbola,

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x^2/9 – y^2/4 = 1

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This hyperbola is going to open to the left and the right,

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
since our x term is positive.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's going to look something like this.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can actually figure out the assymptote.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Actually, let me just do that.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me solve for y.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you get –

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you – you would get –

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me write it this way.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
-y^2/4 = -x^2/9 + 1.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I just subtracted x^2/9 from both sides.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we would get –

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let’s multiply both sides by negative 4.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You get y^2 = (4/9)x^2 - 4.

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or y is equal to …

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And now this will just be the positive part over here.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But I’m doing that so that we can understand its asymptotes.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
y is equal to the square root of (4/9)x^2 – 4.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, as x gets larger, and larger, and larger,

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this term right here is going to stop mattering so much.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So as x approaches infinity –

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As x approaches infinity, this is going to approach

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the square root of 4 over 9x^2.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This constant’s not going to matter much.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, it's going to approach –

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This thing right over here is going to be (2/3)x.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's going to –

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you imagine a slope –

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let’s see.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2/3rds.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you go –

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you run 3, you rise 2.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's going to –

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The asymptote is going to look like that.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It’s going to approach that line over there.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And, it's going to be symmetric – so it's also going to approach –

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So three and two.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it’s also going to approach that line over there.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And, if we want to see where it intersects the x-axis, you just set x –

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
– you just set y = 0.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You get x^2/9 = 1.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So x = +/- 3.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the positive intersection is going to be over there.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So our hyperbola on the right side’s going to look something like –

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
something like that.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's also going to show up on the left side.

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But that's less interesting,

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because it’s not doing anything with the circle.

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, they told us that the hyperbola and the circle

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
intersect at the points a and b.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this, right here, is the point a.

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This, right here, is the point b.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In this question, we want the equation of the circle with

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ab as its diameter.

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So ab – with ab – with ab as the diameter.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(I could have drawn that a little bit straighter.)

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the equation of that circle right over there.

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So essentially, we just need to figure out,

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
“Where does this hyperbola intersect this circle?”

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, if we can –

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The easiest way to do this is to –

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we have two constraints here.

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's solve for y^2 for the circle,

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we can substitute that in for y^2, right here,

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and see what x values they intersect at.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we want the x value out here.

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, something that looks like this value

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the one we want to use.

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then we can figure out the y value.

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The y value is going to be the radius of our circle.

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The x value comma 0 will be the center.

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we'll have our equation.

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's do that.

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this up here, we have –

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(Let me do it in yellow.)

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we subtract x^2 and -8x from both sides,

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the equation of the circle can be rewritten as y^2 is equal to –

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I’m going to add 8x to both sides.

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it’s 8x …

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then subtract negative x^2 from –

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or subtract export from both sides et

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
8x - x^2.

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I really just moved that and that

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over to the right hand side of the equation.

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now I can take this and substitute for y^2

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the equation of the hyperbola.

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the hyperbola’s is equation is x^2/9 - y^2/4 = 1.

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But instead of writing a y^2 over there,

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we know that it has to satisfy this equation, as well.

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So for y^2, I’m going to put in 8x - x^2.

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let's see if we can solve –

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's see if we can't solve this right here.

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is just a straight up quadratic equation,

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
although it might not look like it just yet.

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let’s simplify this.

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this tells us that x^2/9 – 8x/4 –

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So -2x …

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
… plus x^2/ 4 … plus x^2/4.

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(I just distributed, essentially,

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the -1/4th over both of these terms.)

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
… is equal to 1.

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let's see, we can multiply the whole thing times 36,

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to get rid of these fractions, because that’s 4 × 9.

144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 36 ÷ 9 = 4.

145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is 4x^2-36 × 2 (is 72).

146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
72x …

147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
… plus 36/4 is 9 …

148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
… plus nine 9x^2 = 36

149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These two terms right here, we can add them.

150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We get 13x^2 -72x.

151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we could subtract 36 from both sides

152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So [continuing] -36 = 0.

153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So now we just have a straight-up quadratic equation.

154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We just have to find the x's – find the roots.

155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let’s use the quadratic formula here.

156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So x is going to be equal to negative b.

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's negative negative 72.

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that’s 72 ... plus or minus the square root of 72^2.

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(I’ll just write that.)

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
72 × 72 – 4 × a × c.

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
c is -36.

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that negative, you could just put it out here,

163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you just put the 36 out back.

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then all of that – all of that over 2 × a.

165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then all of that –

166
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All of that over all of that that over 26.

167
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the hard part is really to simplify this.

168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it looks like we have some interesting stuff going on.

169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me rewrite this part over here.

170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 72 –

171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me write it over here.

172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
72 × 72 is the same thing as –

173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the same thing as (2 × 36)(2 × 36), right?

174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Each of those are 72.

175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That’s the same thing as 72 × 72.

176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then, we’re adding to that 4 × 36 × 13.

177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4 × 36 × 13.

178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're taking the square root of this whole thing.

179
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I’m just doing the work out here, so we don't

180
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
waste this real estate over here.

181
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now. We can factor out a 4 ×36.

182
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is 4, and this is a 36.

183
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is equal to –

184
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I know it’s getting –

185
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(Let me write it a little bit neater.)

186
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is equal to the square root of –

187
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We can take 4 × 36 …

188
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And actually, a 4 × 36 is one 144.

189
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I’ll just right 4 × 36 right here.

190
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4 × 36.

191
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now over here, we used both 2’s and a 36,

192
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have a 36 left.

193
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We used this 4 × 36.

194
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have +13.

195
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this becomes the square root of 4 times –

196
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4 × 36 = 144.

197
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
36 + 13 = 49.

198
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we're lucky that it actually worked out

199
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to two perfect squares.

200
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is the square root of 144 times the square root of 49,

201
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is 12 × 7.

202
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or, this is equal to 84.

203
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this over here – this business over here –

204
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
simplifies to 72 +/- 84.

205
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This whole thing over here simplifies to 84.

206
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All of that over 26.

207
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now if we subtract 84 …

208
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if we were to subtract 84, we would get something over here

209
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that doesn't make sense in this context.

210
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're looking for something –

211
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a positive x value.

212
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's only consider – let's only consider –

213
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's only consider the +84, and see what we get.

214
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the first thing to do –

215
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Actually, let me just divide the numerator

216
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the denominator by 2.

217
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, this is the same thing as (36 + 42)/13.

218
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this is the same thing as 78 ÷ 13.

219
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it looks like 78 is divisible by 13.

220
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
78 ÷ 13 = 6.

221
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is equal to 6.

222
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the x coordinate here is 6.

223
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's right there.

224
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's 6.

225
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We don't know what the y coordinate is, so let's do that.

226
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's pretty easy to solve.

227
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We could substitute x = 6 into any of these equations.

228
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This one is probably easier right over here.

229
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we get y^2 = 8 × 6 ... is 48 …

230
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus 48 – 36, which is equal to 12.

231
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so y is equal to the square root of 12.

232
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We could simplify that radical if we wanted.

233
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we know the point now.

234
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It’s 6 comma the square root –

235
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sorry.

236
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This point over here is 6, 0 – but the actual intersect –

237
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The center is 6, 0.

238
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But the actual intersection point is going to be 6 …

239
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
… is going to be 6 comma positive square root of 12

240
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(And I should say this is a positive

241
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or negative square root of 12.)

242
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this over here is going to be 6,

243
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative square root of 12.

244
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This right here is 6, 0.

245
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the center of our circle.

246
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what's the equation of this new circle going to be?

247
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What's the equation of this new circle going to be?

248
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we know its center.

249
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It’s center is at 6, 0.

250
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It’s center is at 6, 0.

251
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me write it down here.

252
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its center is at 6, 0.

253
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it's going to be (x-6)^2 + (y-0)^2 =

254
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the radius squared (r^2).

255
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now what’s the radius?

256
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The radius is this height right over here.

257
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or it's just equal to the y value at the intersection.

258
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It’s the square root of 12.

259
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now this is going to be the radius squared

260
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The square root of 12^2 = 12.

261
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the equation is going to be x - 6.

262
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let’s see what form they have right here.

263
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they actually multiple everything out.

264
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let’s just do that.

265
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is going to be x^2 - 12x + 36 + y^2 = 12.

266
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we could subtract 12 from both sides –

267
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
subtract 12 from both sides.

268
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we get x^2 - 12x + 24 + y^2 = 0.

269
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let’s see which of the choices –

270
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let’s see which of the choices match that.

271
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me copy it.

272
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then let me paste it up here.

273
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me paste it up here.

274
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it looks like we have an x^2, positive y^2,

275
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
-12x, and then a +24.

276
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
-12x, +24.

277
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it looks like our answer is A.

278
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Did I do that right?

279
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x^2 - 12x + 24 …

280
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yep.

281
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Our answer is A.
