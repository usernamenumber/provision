99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So our goal in this video is to take the antiderivative of this

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this fairly crazy looking expression

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or another way to say it is to find the indefinite integral of this

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
crazy looking expression. And the key realization right

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over here is that this expression is made up of a bunch of terms.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the indefinite integral of the entire expression

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be equal to the indefinite integral
