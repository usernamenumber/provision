00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,610
Welcome to the video on
completing the square.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,440
What's completing the square?

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,740
Well, it's a way to solve
a quadratic equation.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,700
And so before I--actually, let me just write
down a quadratic equation, and

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,570
then I will show you how
to complete the square.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,460
And then we'll do another
example, and then maybe we'll talk

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,650
a little bit about why it's
called completing the square.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:27,770
So let's say I have this
equation: x squared plus 16x

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,600
minus 57 is equal to 0.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,130
So what are the tools in our
toolkit right now that we

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,970
could use to solve this?

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,570
Well, we could try
to factor it out.

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,770
We could say, what two numbers
add up to 16, and then when you

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,060
multiply them they're minus 57?

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,450
And you'd have to think
about it a little bit.

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,360
And you might get whole
numbers, but you're not even

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,050
sure if there are two whole
numbers that work

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,540
out like that.

19
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,630
This problem there are.

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,510
But, you know, sometimes the
solution is a decimal number

21
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,190
and you don't know it.

22
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,150
So the only time you can really
factor is if you're sure that

23
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,000
you could factor this into
kind of integer expressions.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,620
You know, x plus some integer
or x minus some integer

25
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,920
times, you know, x plus
some other integer.

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,990
Or likewise.

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,240
The other option is to do
the quadratic equation.

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,420
And what we're going to see is
actually the quadratic equation

29
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,510
is just essentially a shortcut
to completing the square.

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,410
The quadratic equation is
actually proven using

31
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,420
completing the square.

32
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,420
So what is completing
the square?

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,340
So what do we do?

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,080
Well, before we move into this
video let's see what happens

35
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,930
if I square an expression.

36
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,220
Let me do it in this down here.

37
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:40,250
What is x plus a, squared?

38
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:50,940
Well that equals x squared
plus 2ax plus a squared.

39
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,680
Right?

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,420
So if you ever see something in
this form, you know that it's

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,740
x plus something squared.

42
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,040
So wouldn't it be neat if we
could manipulate this equation

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,900
so we can write it as x plus a
squared equals something,

44
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,140
and then we could just
take the square root?

45
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,580
And what we're going to do
is, actually, do just that.

46
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,090
And that is completing
the square.

47
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,010
So let me show you an example.

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,515
I think an example will
make it a little clearer.

49
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:17,620
Let me box this away.

50
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,310
This is what you
need to remember.

51
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,130
This is the whole rationale
behind competing the squares--

52
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,650
to get an equation into this
form, onto one side of the

53
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,940
equation, and just have a
number on the other side, so

54
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,210
you could take the square
root of both sides.

55
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,000
So let's see.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,970
First of all, let's just check
to make sure this isn't

57
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,020
a perfect square.

58
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,700
If this were, this coefficient
would be equivalent to the 2a.

59
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,470
Right?

60
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,440
So a would be 8, and
then this would be 64.

61
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,270
This is clearly not 64, so
this right here is not

62
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,840
a squared expression.

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,680
So what can we do?

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,990
Well let me get rid of the
57 by adding 57 to both

65
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,200
sides of this equation.

66
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:07,550
So I would get x squared
plus 16x is equal to 57.

67
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,470
All I did is I added 57 to
both sides of this equation.

68
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,300
Now, what could I add here so
that this, the left-hand side

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,480
of this equation, becomes a
square of some expression

70
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,820
like x plus a?

71
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,790
If you just follow this pattern
down here, we have x squared

72
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:37,880
plus 2ax-- so you could view
this right here as 2ax.

73
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,090
Right?

74
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,900
That's 2ax.

75
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,520
And then we need to add
an a squared to it.

76
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,040
Right?

77
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,300
Plus a squared.

78
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,010
And then we would
have the form here.

79
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,510
But we know from basic algebra
that anything you do to one

80
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,080
side of an equation you
have to do to another.

81
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,230
So we added an a squared
here, so let's add an a

82
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,840
squared here as well.

83
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,350
And now you could essentially
rewrite this as a square

84
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,260
of some expression.

85
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,210
But before that we have to
figure out what a was?

86
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,520
Well how do we do that?

87
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,740
Well, what is a?

88
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,720
If this expression right
here is 2ax, what is a?

89
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,380
Well 2a is going to equal
16, so a is equal to 8.

90
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,020
And you could usually do
that just by inspection;

91
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,630
do it in your head.

92
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,930
But if you wanted to see it
done algebraically you could

93
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,690
actually write 2ax
is equal to 16x.

94
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,090
And then divide both sides
by 2x, and you get a is

95
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,430
equal to 16x over 2x.

96
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,950
And assuming that x doesn't
equal 0 this evaluates to 8.

97
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,130
So a is 8.

98
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,430
So if a is 8 we could rewrite
that expression-- I'll switch

99
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:49,030
colors arbitrarily-- as x
squared plus 16x

100
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,470
plus a squared.

101
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,180
Well, it's 64, because a is 8.

102
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,170
Is equal to 57 plus 64.

103
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,720
Right?

104
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,600
I went through a fairly tedious
explanation here, but all we've

105
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,890
really done to get from there
to there is we added 57 to both

106
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,870
sides of this equation to kind
of get it on the right-hand

107
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,320
side, and then we added 64 to
both sides of this equation.

108
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,830
And why did I add 64 to both
sides of this equation?

109
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,070
So that the left-hand side
expression takes this form.

110
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,200
Now that the left-hand side
expression takes this form

111
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,030
I can rewrite it as what?

112
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,170
x plus a, squared.

113
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,620
I can rewrite it in this form.

114
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,550
And we know that a is 8, so it
becomes x plus 8, squared,

115
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,730
is equal to-- and
what's 57 plus 64?

116
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,090
It's 121.

117
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,270
Now we have what looks like a
fairly straightforward-- it's

118
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,960
still a quadratic equation,
actually, because if you

119
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,350
were to expand this side
you'd get a quadratic.

120
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,065
But we can solve this without
using the quadratic equation

121
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:54,610
or without having to factor.

122
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,390
We can just take the square
root of both sides of this.

123
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,550
And if we take the square root
of both sides what do we get?

124
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,610
We get-- once again,
arbitrarily switching colors--

125
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,230
that x plus 8 is equal to, and
remember this, the plus or

126
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,880
minus square root of 121.

127
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,590
And what's the
square root of 121?

128
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,960
Well it's 11, right?

129
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,630
So then we come here.

130
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,800
Let me box this away.

131
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,620
This was just an aside.

132
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,830
So we get x plus 8 is equal
to plus or minus 11.

133
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,420
And so x is equal to-- subtract
8 from both sides-- minus

134
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,860
8 plus or minus 11.

135
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:41,590
And so x could equal-- so
minus 8 plus 11 is 3.

136
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,970
Right?

137
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,160
Let me make sure I
did that right.

138
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,310
x is equal to minus
8 plus or minus 11.

139
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,140
Yes.

140
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,350
That's right.

141
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,270
So x could be equal to 3.

142
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,960
And then if I took minus
8 minus 11, x could

143
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:10,416
also equal minus 19.

144
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,350
All right.

145
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,200
And let's see if
that makes sense.

146
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,680
So in theory this should be
able to be factored as x

147
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,770
minus 3 times x plus
19 is equal to 0.

148
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,030
Right?

149
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,160
Because these are the two
solutions of this equation.

150
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,190
And that works out, right?

151
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,340
Minus 3 times 19 is minus 57.

152
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,920
And minus 3 plus
19 is plus 16x.

153
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,120
We could have just immediately
factored it this way, but if

154
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,030
that wasn't obvious to us--
because, you know, at least

155
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,600
19 is kind of a strange
number-- we could do it

156
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,800
completing the square.

157
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,690
And so why is it called
completing the square?

158
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,920
Because you get it in this form
and then you have to add this

159
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,950
64 here to kind of complete the
square-- to turn this

160
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,020
left-hand expression into
a squared expression.

161
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,770
Let's do one more.

162
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,920
And I'll do less explanation
and more just chugging through

163
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,105
the problem, and that actually
might make it seem simpler.

164
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,080
But this is going to
be a hairier problem.

165
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:19,930
So let's say I have 6x squared
minus 7x minus 3 is equal to 0.

166
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,980
You could try to factor it,
but personally I don't

167
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,260
enjoy factoring things
when I have a coefficient.

168
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,590
And you can say, oh well why
don't we divide both sides

169
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,970
of this equation by 6?

170
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,960
But then you'd get a fraction
here and a fraction here.

171
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,580
And that's even worse to
factor just by inspection.

172
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,190
You could do the
quadratic equation.

173
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,310
And maybe I'll show you in a
future video, the quadratic

174
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,500
equation-- and I think I've
already done one where I proved

175
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,630
the quadratic equation.

176
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,380
But the quadratic
equation is essentially

177
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,170
completing the square.

178
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,090
It's kind of a shortcut.

179
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,280
It's just kind of
remembering the formula.

180
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,320
But let's complete the square
here, because that's what the

181
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
point of this video was.

182
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,650
So let's add the 3 to both
sides of that equation.

183
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,300
We could do-- well,
let's add the 3 first.

184
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:04,820
So you get 6 x squared
minus 7x is equal to 3.

185
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,770
I added 3 to both sides.

186
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,470
And some teachers will leave
the minus 3 here, and then try

187
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,050
to figure out what to add
to it and all of that.

188
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,170
But I like to get it out of the
way so that I can figure out

189
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,080
very clearly what number
I should put here.

190
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,230
But I also don't
like the 6 here.

191
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,550
It just complicates things.

192
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:25,990
I like to have it x plus a
squared, not some square root

193
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,450
coefficient on the x term.

194
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,530
So let's divide both sides of
this equation by 6, and you get

195
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:39,730
x squared minus 7/6 x is equal
to-- 3 divided by 6

196
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,566
is equal to 1/2.

197
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,190
And we could have made
that our first step.

198
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,450
We could have divided by 6
right at that first step.

199
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,250
Anyway, now let's try to
complete the square.

200
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,800
So we have x squared-- I'm just
going to open up some space--

201
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:59,530
minus 7/6 x plus something is
going to be equal to 1/2.

202
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,400
And so we have to add something
here so that this left-hand

203
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,290
expression becomes a
squared expression.

204
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,620
So how do we do that?

205
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,770
Well essentially we look at
this coefficient, and keep

206
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,610
in mind this is not just
7/6 it's minus 7/6.

207
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,460
You take 1/2 of it, and
then you square it.

208
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,610
Right?

209
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,690
Let me do it.

210
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,290
x plus a, squared, is
equal to x squared plus

211
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,820
2ax plus a squared.

212
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,070
Right?

213
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,750
This is what you have to
remember all the time.

214
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,560
That's all completing the
square is based off of.

215
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,980
So what did I say just now?

216
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,260
Well, this term is going
to be 1/2 of this

217
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,190
coefficient squared.

218
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,190
And how do we know that?

219
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,880
Because a is going to be 1/2 of
this coefficient if you just

220
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,850
do a little bit of
pattern matching.

221
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,760
So what's 1/2 of
this coefficient?

222
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,050
1/2 of minus 7/6 is minus 7/12.

223
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,640
So if you want you could
write a equals minus

224
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,770
7/12 for our example.

225
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,770
And I just multiplied
this by 1/2.

226
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,980
Right?

227
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,660
So what do I add to both sides?

228
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,030
I add a squared.

229
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,930
So what's 7/12 squared?

230
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,220
Well that's going to be 49/144.

231
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,000
If I did it to the left-hand
side I have to do it to

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,630
the right-hand side.

233
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,240
Plus 49/144.

234
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,120
And now how can I simplify
this left-hand side?

235
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,880
What's our next step?

236
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,470
Well we now know it
is a perfect square.

237
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,550
In fact, we know what a
is. a is minus 7/12.

238
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,200
And so we know that this
left-hand side of this equation

239
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:43,390
is x minus a-- or x plus a,
but a is a negative number.

240
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,980
So x plus a, and a is
negative, squared.

241
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,350
And if you want you can
multiply this out and confirm

242
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,130
that it truly equals this.

243
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,920
And that is going to be equal
to-- let's get a common

244
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,360
denominator, 144.

245
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,070
So 72 plus 49 equals 121.

246
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,300
121/144.

247
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,210
So we have x minus 7/12,
all of that squared

248
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,180
is equal to 121/144.

249
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,300
So what do we do now?

250
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,570
Well now we just take
the square root of both

251
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,700
sides of this equation.

252
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,140
And I'm trying to
free up some space.

253
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,215
Switch to green.

254
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:25,320
Let me partition this off.

255
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:33,310
And we get x minus 7/12 is
equal to the plus or minus

256
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:33,940
square root of that.

257
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,120
So plus or minus 11/12.

258
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,390
Right?

259
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,660
Square root of 121 is 11.

260
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,420
Square root of 144 is 12.

261
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,480
So then we could add 7/12 to
both sides of this equation,

262
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:53,100
and we get x is equal to
7/12 plus or minus 11/12.

263
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,660
Well that equals 7
plus or minus 11/12.

264
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,050
So what are the two options?

265
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,930
7 plus 11 is 18, over 12.

266
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,210
So x could equal 18/12, is 3/2.

267
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,010
Or, what's 7 minus 11?

268
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,760
That's minus 4/12.

269
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,370
So it's minus 1/3.

270
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,630
There you have it.

271
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,940
That is completing the square.

272
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,220
Hopefully you found that
reasonably insightful.

273
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,340
And if you want to prove the
quadratic equation, all you

274
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,320
have to do is instead of having
numbers here, write a x squared

275
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,820
plus bx plus c equals 0.

276
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,130
And then complete the square
using the a, b, and c's

277
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,060
instead of numbers.

278
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,180
And you will end up with
the quadratic equation

279
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,110
by this point.

280
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,510
And I think I did
that in a video.

281
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,600
Let me know if I didn't
and I'll do it for you.

282
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,540
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
