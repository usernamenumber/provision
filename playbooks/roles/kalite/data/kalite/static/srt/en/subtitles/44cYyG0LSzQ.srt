3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:08,342
   

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,980
In this video, I want to give
you a general idea of what a

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,970
bond is and why a company might
even issue them in the

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,680
first place.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,310
And just at a very high level,
a bond is essentially a way

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,270
for someone to participate in
lending to a compny, so you're

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,520
a partial lender.

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,850
   

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,790
And just to make that more
concrete, let's imagine some

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,050
type of company that has
$10 million in assets.

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,150
So these are its assets
right there.

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,040
   

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,445
And it has $10 million
in assets.

16
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:46,990
And let's say just for the sake
of simplicity it has no

17
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,080
liabilities.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,850
So all of that value, all of
that $10 million, is what is

19
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,280
owned by the owners or by the
equity, this owner's equity.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,440
So this is $10 million
in equity.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,790
And if we had, let's say,
a million shares.

22
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,440
I'll write it down.

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,150
If we have a million shares
and if we believe this $10

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,230
million number, that implies
that each share is

25
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,550
worth $10 per share.

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,380
Now let's say this company
is doing really well

27
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,400
and it wants to expand.

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,230
It wants to increase its assets
by $5 million so it can

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,580
go out and buy a $5
million factory.

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,940
So it wants-- let me draw it
right here-- it wants another

31
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,620
$5 million in assets that it
needs to build that factory,

32
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,450
or essentially a $5
million factory.

33
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,650
And the question is, how
does it finance it?

34
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,800
Well, one way is that they could
just issue more equity.

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,630
If they're able to get a price
of $10 per share, they could

36
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:55,610
issue another 500,000 shares
at $10 per share.

37
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,250
And then that would

38
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,370
essentially produce $5 million.

39
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,230
So this is scenario one.

40
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,230
They issue 500,000 shares
at $10 dollars a share.

41
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,970
They now have 1.5
million shares.

42
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,640
But these new owners gave them
collectively $5 million.

43
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,470
So the equity would grow
by $5 million.

44
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,250
We now have 1.5 million
shares.

45
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,830
So this would now be 1.5 million
shares, not 1 million.

46
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,890
And that new money from these
new shareholders would go into

47
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,430
the asset side, and then we
would use that to actually buy

48
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,720
the factory.

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,450
What I just described is
essentially issuing equity or

50
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:45,630
financing via equity or
by issuing stock.

51
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,180
Now the other way to do it
is to borrow the money.

52
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,770
So let me re-draw
this company.

53
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,310
I'll leave this up here just
so we can compare the two.

54
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,870
So once again we have $10
million of assets.

55
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,640
   

56
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,650
We have $10 million of equity
to start off with.

57
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,370
   

58
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,370
And instead of issuing stock to
get the $5 million, we're

59
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,440
going to borrow the money.

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,610
So we're essentially
issuing debt.

61
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,750
We could go to a bank
and say, hey, bank,

62
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,400
can I borrow $5 million?

63
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,980
So we would have $5 million
in liability.

64
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,480
It would be debt. $5
million of debt.

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,700
And the bank would give us $5
million of cash that we can

66
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,430
then go use to buy
our factory.

67
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,340
So in either situation, the
asset side of our balance

68
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,100
sheet looks identical,
or the assets of

69
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,380
the company are identical.

70
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,320
We had our $10 million
in assets and

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,680
now we have a factory.

72
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,470
But in the first situation, I
was able to raise that money

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,460
by increasing the number of
shareholders, by increasing

74
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,060
the number of people that I have
to split the profits of

75
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,730
this company with.

76
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,710
In this situation, I was able
to raise the money by

77
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,060
borrowing it.

78
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,660
So the people that I'm borrowing
this money from--

79
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:17,700
this is borrowed money-- they
don't get a cut of the profits

80
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,470
of this company.

81
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,870
What they do is they get paid
interest on their money that

82
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,080
they're lending to us before
these guys get

83
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,210
any profits at all.

84
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,500
In fact, that interest is
considered an expense.

85
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,600
So these guys get interest.

86
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,520
And even if this company does
super, super well and becomes

87
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,390
very, very profitable, these
guys only get their interest.

88
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,870
Likewise, if the company does
really bad and these guys

89
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,540
suffer, as long as the company
doesn't go bankrupt, these

90
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,750
guys are still going to get
their interest. So they're

91
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,850
going to be a lot safer.

92
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,040
They don't get as much of the
reward as the new equity

93
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,120
holders would, but they also
don't get as much of the risk.

94
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,000
Now this is just straight-up
debt.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,570
And you could just get this
from any bank, if they're

96
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,140
willing to.

97
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,090
If they said, oh you're a good
safe company, we're willing to

98
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,670
let you $5 million.

99
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,100
But let's say that no bank
wants to individually

100
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,940
take on that risk.

101
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,910
So you say, hey why, instead of
borrowing $5 million from

102
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,920
one entity, why don't I borrow
it from 5,000 entities?

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,820
So what I can do instead of
borrowing it from one entity,

104
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,350
I could issue these
certificates.

105
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,640
I could issue bonds.

106
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,030
And that's the topic
of this video.

107
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,090
So I issue these certificates.

108
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,580
They have a face value
of $1,000.

109
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,190
This is my face value.

110
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,330
Or sometimes you'll hear the
notion of par value.

111
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,020
   

112
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,910
And I'll say what interest
I'm going to pay on it.

113
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:54,095
So let's say I say it has
a 10% annual coupon.

114
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:57,220
And even though this is the
interest, I'm essentially

115
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,290
going to pay $100 a year.

116
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,590
It's called a coupon because
when bonds were first issued,

117
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,630
they would actually throw these
little coupons on the

118
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,820
bond itself and the owner of the
certificate could rip off

119
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,470
or cut off one of these coupons
and then go to the

120
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,060
person borrowing, or the entity
borrowing the money,

121
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,770
and get their actual
interest payment.

122
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,970
So that's why it's actually
called coupons, but they don't

123
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,990
actually attach those
coupons anymore.

124
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,240
And it has some maturity date.

125
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,790
The date that not only will I
pay your interest back, but

126
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,810
I'll pay the entire principal
back, the entire face value.

127
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:35,130
So let's say the maturity
is in 2 years.

128
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,770
So in this situation, in order
to raise $5 million, I'm going

129
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,870
to have to issue 5,000 of these
cause 5,000 times 1,000

130
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,120
is 5 million.

131
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,920
   

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,910
So if you wanted to lend $1,000
to this company so that

133
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,220
they could expand.

134
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,850
And if you think 10% is a good
interest rate and it's a safe

135
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,170
company, you would essentially
buy one of these bonds.

136
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,860
Maybe you buy it for $1,000.

137
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,070
And when you buy that bond for
$1,000, you are essentially

138
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,060
lending this company
that $1,000.

139
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,630
And if you did that 5,000 times
or if that happened

140
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,520
5,000 times amongst a bunch of
different people, this company

141
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,020
would be able to raise
its $5 million.

142
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,580
Now just to be clear how the
actual payments work, the

143
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,660
coupons tend to get
paid semiannually.

144
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,020
So let me draw a little
timeline here.

145
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,700
And this tends to be the
case in the U.S.

146
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,710
and in Western Europe.

147
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:38,970
If this is today, this
is in 6 months.

148
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,820
This is in 12 months
or 1 year.

149
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,970
This is in 18 months.

150
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,090
And this is in 24 months.

151
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,800
And I'm only going up to 24
months cause I said this bond

152
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,960
matures in 24 months.

153
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,770
So if you hold this bond, this
certificate, what do you get?

154
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:04,640
Well it's going to pay you 10%
annually, so $100 a year.

155
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,130
But they actually pay the
coupon semiannually.

156
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,180
So you get $100 a year,
but you get half

157
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,690
of it every 6 months.

158
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,650
So you're going to get
$50 after 6 months.

159
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,010
You're going to get $50 after 12
months, or after another 6

160
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,470
months, you're going to
get another $50 here.

161
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,770
You're going to get
a final $50 there.

162
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,380
And they're also going to have
to pay you back the original

163
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,320
amount of the loan.

164
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,150
They're also going to have
to pay you the $1,000.

165
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,860
So that last payment is going
to be the coupon of $50 plus

166
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,049
the $1,000.

167
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,640
And so you will have essentially
been getting this

168
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,409
10% annual interest.

169
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,559
Now, when the company does this,
they'll probably have to

170
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,864
issue some type of new bond,
because all of a sudden they

171
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:44,200
have to pay all of these people
this huge lump sum of

172
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,250
money, if they haven't been
able to earn it from the

173
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,780
factories yet.

174
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,312
And we could talk about that
in a future video.
