1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,060
Let's say I have a cliff.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,340
Let's make this cliff, I
don't know, let's say

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,280
it's 50 meters high.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,940
And on this cliff,
I have a car.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,780
And this car is not just
sitting on the cliff,

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,686
it's driving off of it.

7
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,310
A very dramatic problem.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,860
So let's see, I have
this car here.

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,760
And it's driving off of this
cliff at 5 meters per second.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,040
And I want to know, what is
the path of this car as it

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,110
falls off of the cliff?

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,590
So let's set up a little
coordinate axis here.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,480
So let's say that this is
the y-axis right there.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,520
And then this will
be my x-axis.

15
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:56,590
So this is y, this is x.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,290
Let's say that this is the
point-- well, we know that this

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,780
is a 50 meter high cliff.

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,760
Maybe y equals 0 is sea level.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,280
So this would be 50 right here.

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,460
And let's say that this point
right here on the cliff,

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,820
that's at x is equal to 10.

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,840
So this point right
here's the point 10, 50.

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,770
And let's say the car's right
at this point, right about

24
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,200
to drive off the cliff.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,840
And time is equal to 0.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,420
So this is that
time equal to 0.

27
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,890
So t for time.

28
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,830
Time is equal to zero.

29
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,620
So my question is, what
happens to this car as

30
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,810
it drives off the cliff?

31
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,870
So this is a bit of a physics
problem, and I won't go

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,100
deep into the physics.

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,240
And I won't prove some
of the equations.

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,370
And I encourage you to
watch the kinematics

35
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,930
videos, the projectile motion
videos, if you want to know

36
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,360
where the equations come from.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
But the point here is just to
get the equations and see

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
what the graph looks like.

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:59,430
So if I want to know x as a
function of time-- a suitably

40
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,440
vibrant color-- so x as a
function of time is

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,430
going to be what?

42
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,005
Well, we're going to assume
that we're on a planet

43
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:08,080
that has no air.

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,180
We're in a vacuum.

45
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,270
So if we start off in the x
direction at 5 meters per

46
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,260
second to the right, we won't
be decelerated by air or

47
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,730
friction or anything else.

48
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,870
Newton's laws of motion:
an object in motion stays

49
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,330
in motion, unless it's
affected by a net force.

50
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,690
And there won't be any net
force in the x direction.

51
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,600
It's just going to keep
moving to the right at

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,050
5 meters per second.

53
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,810
And position, or distance,
is just equal to

54
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,270
velocity times time.

55
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,840
Our velocity is 5 times time.

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,190
And, of course, it didn't
start at x is equal to 0.

57
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,390
This is at time equals 0.

58
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,200
So it started at x
is equal to 10.

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,090
So you want to know-- it's
kind of x of 0, where it

60
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,360
started off, so plus 10.

61
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,070
And this should be a little
intuitive for you, right?

62
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,180
At time is equal to 0, this
term cancels out, where

63
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,590
x is equal to 10.

64
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,670
That makes sense.

65
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,050
At time is equal to 1, we
should be a little bit-- we'll

66
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,900
be 5 meters further out,
so on and so forth.

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,440
Fair enough.

68
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,490
That's x as a function
of the parameter time.

69
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,660
As you probably realize, that
this is a video on parametric

70
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,920
equations, not physics.

71
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,900
So it's nice to early on
say the word parameter.

72
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,295
Parameter.

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,600
And time tends to be the
parameter when people talk

74
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,840
about parametric equations.

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,780
Although it could be anything.

76
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,310
It could be radius or angle
or who knows what else?

77
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,970
So let's figure out what y
is as a function of time.

78
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,900
So y as a function of time,
it's going to be equal to

79
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,450
the initial y position,
or y of 0, which is 50.

80
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,340
We're 50 meters up in the air.

81
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,230
Plus our initial velocity
in the y direction.

82
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,272
And we don't actually have
any initial velocity

83
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:56,990
in the y direction.

84
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,430
The car isn't jumping,
or isn't diving.

85
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,340
It's just moving
horizontally to the right.

86
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,180
And the cliff is supporting it.

87
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,070
So it has no y velocity.

88
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,460
But if you were curious,
it would be the y

89
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,490
velocity times time.

90
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,820
But since there's no y velocity
times time, at least initially,

91
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,510
I'll put nothing there.

92
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,110
Plus the acceleration
of gravity times

93
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,720
time squared over 2.

94
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,370
We want to figure out the sine.

95
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,080
And just so you know, I mean,
it's nice to touch on the

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,940
physics a little bit, just so
you know where these formulas

97
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,750
come from and you know the
motivation behind why you would

98
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,920
even use a parametric equation.

99
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,580
Gravity goes downwards in this
example, and downwards in

100
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,430
this example is in the
minus y direction.

101
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,050
y is decreasing.

102
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,370
And the real-- and you know,
it's not exact-- but gravity is

103
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,370
normally 9.8 meters per second
squared in most textbooks.

104
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,560
But for the sake of simplifying
this, we'll say that it's

105
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,250
approximately 10 meters
per second squared.

106
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,690
That's how fast everything
will be accelerated

107
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,790
downward on this planet.

108
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,580
Since it has no air, let's
assume it's a planet with

109
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,510
a little bit more
mass than earth.

110
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,170
And since it's going downwards,
its direction is negative.

111
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,180
So in our formula up here, it's
our initial position-- we had

112
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,630
no velocity times time, so I
won't put that there-- minus 10

113
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,600
meters per second squared
times t squared over 2.

114
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,310
And you can watch the
projectile motion videos to

115
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,640
figure out how I got these
formulas right there.

116
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,760
But that's not the
point of this.

117
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,450
The point of this is to graph
what happens to the cars and

118
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,610
learn a little bit about
parametric equations.

119
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,170
So what is the path of this car
as it falls off the cliff?

120
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,450
Let's make a table here.

121
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,980
So x and y are a function of
this third parameter, t.

122
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,050
So we're going to set t at
different values and we're

123
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,700
going to figure out what
x and y are equal to.

124
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,460
And I'm just going to
arbitrarily pick some t's.

125
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,030
T is equal to 0.

126
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,560
T is equal to 1, 2, and 3.

127
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,970
At time is equal
to 0, what is x?

128
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,750
x of 0-- this is 0-- x
is equal to 10 meters.

129
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,850
At time is equal
to 1, what is x?

130
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,110
And this is x of 1, right?

131
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,560
If I wanted to write
that notation.

132
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,185
So 5 times 1 is 5,
plus 10 is 15.

133
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,920
x of 2?

134
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,770
5 times 2 plus 10, that's 20.

135
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,480
And it makes sense.

136
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,625
Every second we're getting 5
meters more to the right.

137
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,420
Or x is increasing by 5 meters.

138
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,890
So when t is equal to
3, 15 plus 10 is 25.

139
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,800
Easy enough.

140
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,720
The y is a little bit
more complicated.

141
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,590
And just to simplify this, it's
the same thing as 5, right?

142
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,520
10 divided by 2.

143
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,150
So 50 minus 5t squared.

144
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,210
So time is equal to 0,
this term cancels out.

145
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,310
We just have 50 meters
up in the air.

146
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,940
At time is equal to 1, 1
squared is 1 times 5, is five.

147
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:00,190
50 minus 5 is 45 five
meters in the air.

148
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,970
Is that right?

149
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,910
Right, yeah, time 1, 50.

150
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,730
Right.

151
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,880
And then at time is equal
to 2, 2 squared is 4.

152
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,100
4 times 5 is 20.

153
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,980
50 minus 20 is 30.

154
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,270
And then finally, at time is
equal to 3-- and I just say

155
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,530
finally because that's the
last number we picked--

156
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,570
time is equal to 3.

157
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,200
3 squared is 9.

158
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,280
9 times 5 is 45.

159
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,170
50 minus 45 is 5.

160
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,810
So let's plot these points.

161
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,380
So the time is equal to 0.

162
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,530
That's what we got right there.

163
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,050
At time is equal to 1,
we're at x is equal to 15.

164
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,090
That's roughly, you see this
is 5, 10, 15-- let me do

165
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,380
all of them-- 15, 20, 25.

166
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,830
And then the y-axis-- let me
label that while we're at

167
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:53,890
it-- this is roughly
10, 20, 30, 40, 50.

168
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,770
So at time is equal to
0, we're at 10, 50.

169
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,040
That's that point right there.

170
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,700
At time is equal to
1, we're at 15, 45.

171
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,200
So x is 15, y is 45, which
is right about there.

172
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,550
So this is t is equal to 1.

173
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:15,070
At time is equal to 2, or
at the coordinate 20, 30,

174
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,890
it's right about there.

175
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,480
So this is at time
is equal to 2.

176
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,170
And then at time is equal
to 3, we're at 25, 5.

177
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,240
So we're right there.

178
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,240
And if we kept going on,
at some point we're

179
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,950
going to hit the ground.

180
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,860
And you can figure out,
actually-- set this equal to 0

181
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,600
and you figure out the exact
time you hit the ground.

182
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,720
Actually, let's do that.

183
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,470
If this is equal to 0, 50,
you get t is equal to

184
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,470
the square root of 10.

185
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,500
Which is a little
over 3 seconds.

186
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,830
Which makes sense, right?

187
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,220
A little over 3 seconds, we're
going to be hitting the ground.

188
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,940
But anyway, what's the
path of this car?

189
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,420
Well, it's going to look
something like this.

190
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,690
Ooh, it starts getting
accelerated downwards,

191
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,510
and then plunk!

192
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,830
It hits the ground at 3
point something seconds.

193
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,820
Now what was interesting here
is that by setting the

194
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,600
parameter, not only did we
get the curve-- right?

195
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,710
We got this curve, which is
kind of half of a parabola,

196
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,800
half of a downward shaping
parabola-- and we could

197
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,150
actually eliminate the t,
and just get the equation

198
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,960
for that parabola.

199
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,480
And we'll do that
in future videos.

200
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,360
But what was interesting,
by making it a parametric

201
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,310
equation, we know the
direction of the car.

202
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,430
If you just saw this graph
without the car and everything

203
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,800
else I drew, you wouldn't know
which way the car was falling.

204
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,920
But now we know that as
t is increasing, we're

205
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,850
going in that direction.

206
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,870
So we can draw
some arrows here.

207
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,600
So because it's a parametric
equation, we can

208
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
draw some arrows.

209
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,590
And then the most important
thing is we know exactly where

210
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,910
the car is at any time t.

211
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,600
You can substitute t is equal
to 1.25 seconds and you'll know

212
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,520
exactly where the car is.

213
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,850
So you can plot these points
and you can kind of get a sense

214
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,250
that as time goes on, we're
getting accelerated downwards.

215
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,950
And that's why, for every
second further, especially

216
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,070
the y distance gets
further and further apart.

217
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,590
Anyway, I just wanted to
give you this example.

218
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,240
Although this was a good
physics problem, the intention

219
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,245
wasn't to teach you physics.

220
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:07,100
The intention is to give you
the motivation behind why

221
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,190
parametric equations
even exist.

222
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,390
These two things are
parametric equations.

223
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:22,000
We defined x and y as a
function of a third parameter,

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,910
t, instead of defining y in
terms of x or x in terms of

225
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,250
y like we've done every
other time since then.

226
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,240
And this is super useful.

227
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,030
I mean, you could imagine when
you have really hard physics

228
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,410
problems where you want to
figure out the three

229
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,630
dimensional position of
something, then you'll have x

230
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,420
as a function of t, y as a
function of t, z as

231
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,400
a function of t.

232
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,450
All sorts of interesting
problems come out of using

233
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,020
parametric equations,
not just in physics.

234
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,980
But anyway, I thought
a good place to start

235
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,720
is the motivation.

236
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,380
Because the first time I
learned parametric equations I

237
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,500
was like, why mess up my nice
and simple world of x's and

238
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,630
y's by introducing a
third parameter, t?

239
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,550
This is why.

240
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,240
Because you can figure
out the path of things.

241
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,760
You can figure out the
direction of something as it

242
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,120
moves along a curve, and you
can figure out its exact

243
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,110
position at any, in
this case, time.
