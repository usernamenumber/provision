1
00:00:01,045 --> 00:00:05,000
since we've been talking how stars formed and the evolution of stars

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,638
i thought it was about time that we looked at some cool pictures of stars

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,214
forming or stars themselves, or evolution of stars.

4
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:23,600
so this right here is from the Eagle Nebula,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,883
Just so you know, the word Nebula is kind of a general word for any interstellar cloud of gas or dust

6
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:34,133
so when we're talking about the Eagle nebula, we're actually talking about a huge nebula

7
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,733
and actually, it's a nebula that expands.

8
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:44,400
and so that you have a sense, this is just one of the pillars of the "Pillars of creation"

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,133
This is just a small part of the actual Eagle Nebula

10
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:52,467
And just this pillar right over here, just this pillar here

11
00:00:52,467 --> 00:01:01,400
so that you have a sense of how large it is, just this pillar itself is 7 light years

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,551
it is 7 light years talls

13
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:06,467
so this is an enormous amount of distance

14
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:11,425
remember, the distance from earth to the nearest star was about 4 light years

15
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,839
it would take voyager, if it were pointed in the right direction

16
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:17,333
moving at 60 thousand kilometers per hour

17
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:21,333
it would take Voyager 80 thousand years to go 4 light years

18
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,822
just this pillar is 7 light years

19
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:29,333
but i wanted to show you this because these type of nebulae, the plural of nebula

20
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,160
are where stars can form.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,400
so this right here, you actually see, is actually a breeding ground for the birth of new stars

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,933
this gas is condensing, just like we talked about a couple of videos ago. Until it gets to that critical

23
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:45,333
temperature, the critical density, where you can actually get

24
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:49,267
fusion of hydrogen

25
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:53,933
so this is just a huge interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas

26
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:59,200
and over here you can see its just this breeding ground for stars

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,159
and we don't even, we think that this structure doesn't even exist anymore

28
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,400
because remember, this thing is very very far away from us

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,267
in fact is, just so you have the number, this thing is 7000 light years away

30
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:17,416
7000 light years away

31
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:23,867
which means that what we are seeing now, the photons that are reaching our eyes or telescopes right now

32
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:28,492
left this region of space 7000 years ago

33
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:31,133
so we're seeing it as it was 7000 years ago

34
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:36,533
so a lot of this gas, a lot of this hydrogen, may have already condensed into many many more stars

35
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:39,800
so the structure might not be the way it looks right now

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,267
and actually there was another

37
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:45,867
super nova that happened that might have blown away a lot of this stuff

38
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:49,000
and we won't even be able to see the effects of this super nova

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,085
for another thousand years

40
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:53,600
but anyway, this is just a pretty amazing photograph in my opinion

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
especially, and its beautiful at any scale

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,067
and it's even more mindblowing when you think that this is 7, this is a structure

43
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:02,200
that is 7 light years tall

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,667
and this is really just part of the Eagle Nebula

45
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,921
one of the pillars of creation

46
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:13,236
this right here is a star field, and this is as we're looking towards the center of our galaxy

47
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:13,933
the milkyway

48
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,162
this is the Sagittarius star field

49
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:20,267
the neat thing here you see is such a diversity in stars

50
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:24,916
this is also kind of mind numbing because every one of these stars, are inside of our galaxy

51
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,933
this is looking towards the center of our galaxy

52
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:32,333
this isn't one of those where we're looking beyond our galaxy or looking at clusters of galaxies

53
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,000
this is just stars here

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,153
but the thing here is that you see a huge variety, you see some stars that are

55
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:40,467
shining red, right over here

56
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,819
and obviously, the apparent size, you cannot completely tell

57
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:46,933
because the different stars are at different distances and at difference intensities

58
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:52,933
but the redder stars, these are stars in their red giant phase

59
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,400
or they're probably at their red giant phase

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,333
i haven't done specific research on these stars

61
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,957
but that's what we suspect

62
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:00,467
those are in their red giant phase

63
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:04,933
the ones that are kind of in the yellowish white part of the spectrum

64
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:07,133
these are stars that are probably in their main sequence

65
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:10,892
probably not too different than own sun

66
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:16,348
the ones that are in the yellowish white, closer to orange-yellowish-white part of the spectrum

67
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:22,641
and the ones that look a little more bluish, or a little bit more greenish

68
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:24,986
these are burning super fast

69
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:27,867
let me see if i can find, this one looks a little big bluish to me,

70
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:34,800
these are burning super super fast, and so

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,218
the super massive stars, they burn kind of fast and furious and then just die out

72
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,000
but the smaller stars, the ones with less mass

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,020
they burn slower over a much much longer period of time

74
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,017
so the ones that are burning fast

75
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:56,101
are emitting a lot of energy at the smaller wavelength part of the light spectrum

76
00:04:56,101 --> 00:05:00,267
that's why they look bluer or greener and these are going to be more massive stars

77
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,438
the ones that look white or bluer or greener

78
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:04,933
while the redder ones

79
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:09,800
the redder ones are less massive stars that are kind of in their super giant phase

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,000
and so they are at this point cooler than the main sequence stars

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,333
this right here, this right here is the cat's eye nebula

82
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,933
and the word nebula, this is actually a planetary nebula

83
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:27,680
this one here is a planetary nebula

84
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,019
and it's called a nebula because it is kind of this gas that's kinda floating out in space

85
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,067
but it's at a completely different kind of scale than this Eagle nebula

86
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:41,200
that we drew over here

87
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
so when people talk about nebulas, they normally talking about something like the eagle nebula

88
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,467
these huge masses of interstella gas

89
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:51,318
when people talk about planetary nebulas; this is actually still a huge radius

90
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,267
but no where near 7 light years

91
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:59,538
but this is the bi-product of a star shedding all of its outer material

92
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:03,400
so at the center of this, we see kind of a mature star here

93
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,133
and it's shed of kind of its outer layers

94
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,174
and it did that in its red giant phase

95
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:12,733
so the core would keep flaring up, having these hot explosions

96
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:18,485
and every time you have one of these hot explosions, you had more and more of its outer layers getting

97
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:21,156
pushed off, pushed off into space

98
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:23,467
forming this planetary nebula

99
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,267
so this as we see it right now

100
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:29,467
its still not yet a white dwarf, it is still an active star

101
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:35,867
fusion is still occurring in this star, but it is well on its way onto becoming a a white dwarf

102
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:37,502
once all its fuel runs out

103
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:42,200
it's past its red giant phase, it's thrown all of this material into space and it's on its way onto becoming

104
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,333
a white dwarf

105
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,600
anyway hopefully you enjoyed that

106
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,267
i actually find all of these images to be pretty captivating

107
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,800
especially the star field one

108
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,502
because this just inside of our galaxy

109
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:55,933
hopefully it gives more appreciation for how many stars there are

110
00:06:55,933 --> 99:59:59,999
i mean this is just a small fraction of the 200 to 400 billion stars inside the milky way
