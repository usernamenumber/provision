1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,206
I just want to follow up on the last video

2
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:05,596
Where we threw balls up in the air and saw how long they stayed up in the air

3
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:08,568
and we used that to figure out how fast we inicialy threw the ball

4
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:10,612
and how high they went in the air

5
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:12,841
and in the last video we did it with specific numbers

6
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:14,420
and in this video I just want to see if we can derive

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,485
some interesting formulas so we can do the computations

8
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:20,132
really fast in our brains while we're playing this game

9
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:23,150
on some type of a field and we don't necessarily have, have any,

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,590
any paper around

11
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,934
so lets say that the ball is in the air for delta T

12
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:30,952
delta T is equal to time in the air

13
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:34,267
time in the air

14
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,407
then we know that the time up is going to be half that

15
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:38,893
which is the same thing as the time down

16
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:42,600
the time up is going to be equal to delta T

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,420
we'll do that the same color

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,739
is going to be equal to the time in the air divided by two

19
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,943
so how, What was our initial velocity?

20
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:55,751
Well all we have to do is remind ourselves that the change in velocity

21
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:59,606
the change in velocity which is the same thing as the final velocity minus

22
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:01,603
the initial velocity

23
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,006
so the final velocity, remember, we're just talking about

24
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:07,090
half of the path of this ball so the time that get's released

25
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,312
and it goes and its, and it's going as kind of it's

26
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:11,754
maximum upward velocity it goes slower and slower and slower

27
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:16,610
all the way until it's stationary for just a moment then starts going down

28
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,621
again, remember the acceleration is costed downwards

29
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,333
this entire time so what is the final velocity if we just

30
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,959
consider half of this time well the time is zero so

31
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,234
it's going to be zero minus our

32
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:32,493
inicial velocity, minus our inicial velocity

33
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,296
when it was taking off

34
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:36,200
thats our change in velocity

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,352
this is our change in velocity, this is our change in velocity

36
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:44,234
is going to be equal to the acceleration of gravity

37
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:46,231
the acceleration of gravity

38
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,668
now negative nine point eight meters per second square

39
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:51,990
or the acceleration due to gravity

40
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,476
when an object is in freefall

41
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:54,544
to be technicaly correct times,

42
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:58,770
times, times the time we are going up

43
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,275
so times delta T up witch is the same thing

44
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:05,036
I won't even write it delta T up

45
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:08,012
is the same thing as our total time in the air

46
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:15,256
our total time in the air, divided by two and so we get we get, negative

47
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:22,098
the initial velocity, is equal to this thing divided be two is going to be

48
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:24,823
four point nine meters per second square

49
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:26,680
we still have our negative out in front

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,120
times our delta T, times our delta T, and remember this is our total time

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,204
in the air, not just the time up, this is our total time in the air

52
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:38,012
and then we multiply both sides times the negative and we get

53
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:44,593
our initial velocity, is just going to be equal to four point nine, four point nine

54
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:49,808
meters per second square times the total time, the total time

55
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:53,533
that we are in the air, or you could say, the or you could say

56
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:58,167
it's the, it's going to be nine point eight meters per second square times half

57
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,600
of the time that we're in the air, either of those will get you the same

58
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,832
calculation, so lets figure out our total distance,

59
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:11,170
or the distance that we travel in that first in the time of, so that will give us the peek distance, remember that distance

60
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,267
or should i say displacement in this situation, displacement is equal to

61
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:23,393
average velocity, average velocity times the change in time, the change in time that we care

62
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:28,074
about is the time of, so that is our delta T over two, our total time

63
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:33,740
our total time divided by two, this is our, this is our time of

64
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,520
time of, and whats our average velocity? well the average velocity

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,696
if we assume constant acceleration is your initial velocity plus your final velocity

66
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:52,083
over two, its really just the mean of the two things. well we know what our initial

67
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:56,170
velocity is our initial velocity is this thing over here, so this thing is

68
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,533
this thing over here, our final velocity, remember we're just talking about

69
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:03,183
the first half of the time the ball's in the air so it's final velocity

70
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:08,755
is zero we're talking when it gets to this peak point over here

71
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:13,817
its from two videos ago, that peak point right over there, so our average

72
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:19,856
velocity is just going to be, our average velocity is just going to be, this stuff divided by two

73
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:26,133
so it's going to be four point nine meters per second square, times delta T

74
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:34,901
times delta T over, over two, so this right here this is our average velocity

75
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:40,009
velocity average so lets stick that back over here

76
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,588
so our maximum displacement

77
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:47,300
our maximum displacement is going to be our average velocity, so that is going to be

78
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:55,583
four point nine meters per second square times delta T, times delta T, all of that over two

79
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:59,537
and then we multiply that again times the total times the time of,

80
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:06,271
so times delta T over two again, this is the same thing, and these are the same thing

81
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:10,033
and then we can simplify it, our maximum displacement is equal to

82
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:18,703
four point nine meters per second squared times delta T squared, times delta T squared

83
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:24,592
all of that over, all of that over four and then we can just divide four point nine

84
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:31,233
divided by four, four point nine divided by four is, what is it, it's one point

85
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:37,409
one point two, one point two, two, five I believe, let me just get my calculator out

86
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,267
I don't want to do that in my head, get this far and make a careless mistake

87
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:45,490
four point nine divided by four is one point two two five

88
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:53,245
so this is, so our maximum displacement is going to be one point two two five times our total

89
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:58,586
time in the air, total time in the air squared, witch is a pretty, witch is a pretty

90
00:05:58,586 --> 00:06:02,580
straight forward, witch is a pretty straight forward calculation

91
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:09,917
so this is, this is our max displacement, kind of how far do we, how high are we getting

92
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:16,186
displaced, right when, right when that ball is stationary, or is, is , is no net velocity

93
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:21,341
just for a moment and starts decelerating downwards, so we can use that is a ball is in the air

94
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:25,846
for five seconds we can verify our computation from the last video

95
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:31,790
it would, our max velocity is one point two two five times five squared

96
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,690
which is twenty five, will give us thirty point six two five, that's what we got in the last video

97
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:43,210
if the balls in the air for, i don't know two point three seconds, so its one point two, two, five

98
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,931
times two point three squared, then that means that it went

99
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:53,631
six point four, eight meters in the air, so anyway I just wanted to give you a, a simply expression

100
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:57,982
that gives you, that gives you the maximum displacement from the ground,

101
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:04,159
assuming air resistance is negligible as a function of the total time in the air

102
00:07:04,159 --> 99:59:59,999
and I don't know, I find that pretty fun and it's, it's a neat game to play
