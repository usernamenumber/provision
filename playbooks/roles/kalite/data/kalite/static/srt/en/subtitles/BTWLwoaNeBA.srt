00:00:00,783 --> 00:00:03,389
In the last video I gave a little bit of a

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,243
hand wavey explanation about why S-Waves

3
00:00:06,243 --> 00:00:09,365
don't travel in liquid or air.

4
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:10,409
What I want to do in this video

5
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:12,459
is give you a little bit more intuitive understanding

6
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:14,867
of that, it'd really go down to the molecular level.

7
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:18,361
So let's draw a solid.

8
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:22,547
And it has nice covalent bonds, strong bonds

9
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:24,446
between the different molecules.

10
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:27,212
And the bonds are drawn by these lines in between.

11
00:00:27,212 --> 00:00:29,580
So if I were to hit this solid

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,568
with this really small hammer,

13
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:33,377
just hit it at a molecular level

14
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:37,944
If I were to hit these molecules hard enough

15
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:41,612
that they move but not so hard that it breaks the bonds

16
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:45,111
then what it's going to look like is

17
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:49,372
this row of molecules are going to move to the left

18
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:51,873
That row of molecules moving to the left.

19
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:55,670
And the row above it won't fully move to the left just yet

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,894
but it will start to get pulled.

21
00:00:57,894 --> 00:01:01,301
Let me just draw all of the bonds.

22
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:03,495
Because these are strong bonds that we have

23
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:07,384
in a solid, actually they could be

24
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:11,044
ionic bonds as well, because they are strong bonds

25
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:13,242
that we have in this solid,

26
00:01:13,242 --> 00:01:16,169
they will essentially be pulled in the direction

27
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:21,442
the top row will be pulled in the direction of the bottom row

28
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:23,752
They'll start moving in that direction

29
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:26,476
and then the bottom row will recoil back

30
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:28,472
and then you fast forward a little bit

31
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:33,416
Then the top row will have moved to the left

32
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:38,190
Now the bottom row will start to move back

33
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:43,009
And then the bottom row will start to move back

34
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,447
especially because, remember, it's bonded to

35
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:48,072
other things down here.

36
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:49,685
It's bonded to more of the solids down here

37
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:51,278
so it'll move back and you can see this

38
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:55,148
tranverse wave, this S Wave, propagating.

39
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,435
Essentially right over here the peak of the S Wave

40
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:00,847
is here, now it has moved up.

41
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:02,859
Now let's think about the exact

42
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,222
same situation with the liquids.

43
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:05,595
In liquids you don't have these strong

44
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:07,879
ionic or covalent bonds between the

45
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,410
different molecules.

46
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,276
You just have these weak kind of bonds

47
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:13,515
usually formed due to polarity

48
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:17,983
so in a liquid, water's a good example,

49
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:20,752
you just have these weaker bonds formed

50
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:24,506
because water is a polar molecule

51
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:28,311
so the halfway polar sides or halfway positive sides

52
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:30,934
are somewhat attracted to the halfway negative sides

53
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,414
so they flow past each other

54
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:36,683
But if I were to hit these water molecules right here

55
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:39,390
with my hammer, what would happen?

56
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,458
Well they're definitely going to start

57
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,637
moving to the left.

58
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:44,499
This one's going to bump into that one

59
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:45,560
which is going to bump into that one...

60
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,380
They're going to move to the left

61
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,564
But these molecules aren't

62
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:55,279
going to move with them

63
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:57,107
You can view it as going to break

64
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:58,441
that very weak bond due to polarity

65
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:00,931
they're going to move away from each other

66
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,235
Let me draw these top molecules in green.

67
00:03:03,235 --> 00:03:07,577
They're essentially just going to flow past each other

68
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:09,598
And this guy might have had weak bonds

69
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:11,435
with stuff below it too.

70
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:15,343
I should draw it as dotted lines

71
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:19,694
But because of the impact here

72
00:03:19,694 --> 00:03:20,858
these guys are just going to flow

73
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:22,933
they're actually going to compress in this direction

74
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:25,197
You're going to have a P Wave, a compression wave

75
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:28,243
where this one bumps into that one and goes back

76
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:29,627
and this one bumps into that one and goes back

77
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:30,976
and this one bumps into that one

78
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:34,772
but the bonds aren't strong enough

79
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,930
and it's even more the case with air

80
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,540
But the bonds aren't strong enough for

81
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,975
these blue guys to take these green guys

82
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:42,213
for a ride. And these bonds are also not

83
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:46,359
strong enough for the adjacent molecules

84
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,611
to help these blue guys to retract

85
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:51,477
to their original position.

86
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:54,114
So when I talked about elasticity in the last video

87
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:55,199
that's what I was talking about.

88
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,492
The bonds aren't strong enough to cause

89
00:03:57,492 --> 00:03:59,638
things that have deformed to move back to

90
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:00,662
where they are.

91
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:02,452
And also the bonds aren't strong enough to

92
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:04,529
allow things that are deformed to pull other things

93
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:07,140
with it.

94
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,246
And that's why in general S Waves only

95
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:11,844
travel in solid and they won't travel

96
00:04:11,844 --> 99:59:59,999
in liquid or air.
