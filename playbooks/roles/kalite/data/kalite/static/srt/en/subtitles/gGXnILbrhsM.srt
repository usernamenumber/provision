1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,070
Let's see if we can use our
knowledge of Green's theorem

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,200
to solve some actual
line integrals.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,950
And actually, before I show an
example, I want to make one

5
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,960
clarification on
Green's theorem.

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,310
All of the examples that I did
is I had a region like this,

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,970
and the inside of the region
was to the left of

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,820
what we traversed.

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,940
So all my examples I went
counterclockwise and so our

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,800
region was to the left of-- if
you imagined walking along the

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,120
path in that direction, it
was always to our left.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,910
And that's the situation which
Green's theorem would apply.

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,880
So if you were to take a line
integral along this path, a

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,010
closed line integral, maybe we
could even specify

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:39,520
it like that.

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,900
You'll see that in some
textbooks-- along the curve c

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:50,620
of f dot dr. This is what
equals the double integral over

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:58,680
this region r of the partial of
q with respect to x minus

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,670
the partial of p with
respect to y d area.

20
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,520
And just as reminder, now this
q and p are coming from the

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,430
components of f in
the situation.

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:16,600
f would be written as f of xy
is equal to P of xy time the i

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,290
component plus Q of xy
times the j component.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,010
So this is a situation where
the inside of the region is

25
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,180
to the left of the direction
that we're taking the path.

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,200
If it was in the reverse,
then we would put a

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,550
minus sign right here.

28
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,110
If this arrow went the other
way, we'd put a minus sign and

29
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,730
we can do that because we know
that when we're taking line

30
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,540
integrals through vector
fields, if we were reverse

31
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,500
the direction it becomes
the negative of that.

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,370
We showed that, I think,
4 or 5 videos ago.

33
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,320
With that said, it was
convenient to write

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,590
Green's theorem up here.

35
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,060
Let's actually solve a problem.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,820
Let's say I have the line
integral and let's say

37
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,140
we're over a curve.

38
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,845
I'll define the
curve in a second.

39
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:01,540
But let's say that the integral
we're trying to solve is x

40
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:13,230
squared minus y squared
dx plus 2xy dy.

41
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,870
And then our curve-- they're
giving us the boundary.

42
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,430
The boundary is the region.

43
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,420
I'll do it in a
different color.

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:37,820
So the curve is boundary of the
region given by all of the

45
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,710
points x,y such that x is a
greater than or equal to 0,

46
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,590
less than or equal to 1.

47
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,210
And then y is greater than
or equal to 2x squared and

48
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,700
less than or equal to 2x.

49
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,520
So let's draw this region that
we're dealing with right now.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,450
So let me draw my x-axis
or my y-axis, sorry.

51
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,210
My y-axis and then my
x-axis right there.

52
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,360
And let's see. x goes from
0 to 1, so if we make--

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,910
that's obviously 0.

54
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,950
Let's say that that is x
is equal to 1, so that's

55
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,600
all the x values.

56
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,640
And y varies, it's above
2x squared and below 2x.

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,120
Normally, if you get to large
enough numbers, 2x squared is

58
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,530
larger, but if you're below 1
this is actually going to

59
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,660
be smaller than that.

60
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,880
So the upper boundary is
2x, so there's 1 comma 2.

61
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,240
This is a line y is equal to
2x, so that is the line y is--

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,770
let me draw a straighter
line than that.

63
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,270
The line y is equal to 2x
looks something like that.

64
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,060
That right there is
y is equal to 2x.

65
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,710
Maybe I'll do that in yellow.

66
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,520
And then the bottom curve right
here is y is going to be

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,110
greater than 2x squared.

68
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,250
It might look
something like this.

69
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,830
And of course, the region that
they're talking about is this,

70
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,620
but we're saying that the curve
is the boundary of this region

71
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,200
and we're going to go in I
counterclockwise direction.

72
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,300
I have to specify that.

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,410
   

74
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,400
So our curve, we could start at
any point really, but we're

75
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,900
going to go like that.

76
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,740
Then get to that point and then
come back down along that

77
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,950
top curve just like that.

78
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,090
And so this met the condition
that the inside of the region

79
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,340
is always going to be our left,
so we can just do the straight

80
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,660
up Green's theorem, we don't
have to do the negative of it.

81
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,140
And let's define our region.

82
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,530
Let's just do our region.

83
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,820
This integral right here is
going to go-- I'll just do it

84
00:04:46,820 --> 00:05:01,940
the way-- y varies from y is
equal to 2x squared to

85
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,290
2y is equal to 2x.

86
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,380
And so maybe we'll integrate
with respect to y first.

87
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,245
And then x, I'll
do the outside.

88
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,850
   

89
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,780
The boundary of x
goes from 0 to 1.

90
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,940
So they set us up well to
do an indefinite integral.

91
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,930
Now we just have to figure
out what goes over

92
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,490
here-- Green's theorem.

93
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,800
   

94
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,660
Our f would look like
this in this situation.

95
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:37,300
f is f of xy is going to be
equal to x squared minus

96
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,940
y squared i plus 2xy j.

97
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,190
We've seen this in
multiple videos.

98
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,090
You take the dot product of
this with dr, you're going to

99
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,250
get this thing right here.

100
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,690
So this expression right
here is our P of x y.

101
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,070
And this expression right
here is our Q of xy.

102
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,640
   

103
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,060
So inside of here we're just
going to apply Green's

104
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,320
theorem straight up.

105
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:12,080
So the partial of Q with
respect to x-- so take

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,240
the derivative of this
with respect to x.

107
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,390
We're just going to
end up with the 2y.

108
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,050
   

109
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,270
And then from that we're going
to subtract the partial

110
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,750
of P with respect to y.

111
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,300
So if you take the derivative
of this with respect to y that

112
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,260
becomes 0 and then, here you
have-- the derivative with

113
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,900
respect to y here is minus 2y.

114
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,790
   

115
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,900
Just like that.

116
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,360
And so this simplifies
to 2y minus minus 2y.

117
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,470
That's 2y plus plus 2y.

118
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,950
I'm just subtracting
a negative.

119
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,190
Or this inside, and just
to save space, this

120
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,890
inside-- that's just 4y.

121
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,320
I don't want to have to
rewrite the boundaries.

122
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,050
   

123
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,940
That right there is
the same thing as 4y.

124
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,310
The partial of Q with respect
to y, 2y minus the partial

125
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,860
of P with respect to y.

126
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,680
Which is minus 2y.

127
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,510
You subtract a negative
you get a positive.

128
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,500
You have 4y.

129
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,780
Let's take the antiderivative
of the inside with respect

130
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,350
to y and we're going
to get 2y squared.

131
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,410
Let me do it a
little bit lower.

132
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:29,620
We're going to get 2y squared
if you take the partial with

133
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,100
respect to y you're
going to get 4y.

134
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:42,000
We're going to evaluate that
from y is equal to 2x squared

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,550
to y is equal to 2x.

136
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,150
And then of course, we
still have the outside

137
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,632
integral still there.

138
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:51,520
x goes from 0 to 1 dx.

139
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
This thing is going to be equal
to the integral from 0 to 1 and

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,750
then we evaluate
it first at 2x.

141
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,100
So you put a 2x in here,
2x squared is 4x squared.

142
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,960
2 squared, x squared, so
4x squared times 2 is

143
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,500
going to be 8x squared.

144
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,790
Minus-- put this guy in there.

145
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,600
2x squared squared is
2x to the fourth.

146
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,130
4x to the fourth times
2 is 8x to the fourth.

147
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,210
Did I do that right?

148
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,350
2x squared-- going to
put it there for y,

149
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,690
substitute y with it.

150
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,760
That squared is 4
X to the fourth.

151
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,430
Times 2 is 8x x to the fourth.

152
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,040
Very good.

153
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,770
All right.

154
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,550
Now dx.

155
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,850
Now this is just a
straightforward

156
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,600
one-dimensional integral.

157
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,400
This is going to be equal
to-- I'll just do it here.

158
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,720
This is going to be equal to
the antiderivative of 8x

159
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,485
squared is 8/3 x to the third.

160
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:53,920
   

161
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,740
And then the antiderivative
of 8x to the fourth is

162
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,950
minus 8/5 x to the fifth.

163
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,503
Then we're going to have to
evaluate that from 0 to 1, or

164
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:09,590
we can put a little line there.

165
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,195
When you put 1 in there
you get-- I'll do it

166
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:13,450
in a different color.

167
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,890
We get 8/5 times 1 to
the third, which is 8/5

168
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,550
minus 8/5 minus 8/5.

169
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,335
And then we're going to have
minus-- when you put 0 in

170
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:27,490
here you're just going
to get a bunch of 0's.

171
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,170
Oh sorry, I made a mistake.

172
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,210
It would have been a blunder.

173
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:31,760
It's 8/3.

174
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,310
   

175
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,640
8/3 times 1 to the third minus
8/5 times 1 to the fifth,

176
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,780
so that's minus 8/5.

177
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,705
And then, when you subtract the
0, you evaluate 0 here. you're

178
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:45,850
just going to get a bunch of
0's so you don't have

179
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,670
to do anything else.

180
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,470
So now we just have to
subtract these two fractions.

181
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,990
So let's get a common
denominator of 15.

182
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,540
8/3 is the same thing if
we multiply the numerator

183
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,690
and denominator by 5.

184
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,820
That is 40/15.

185
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,020
And then if we multiply this
numerator and denominator by

186
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,320
3, that's going to be 24/15.

187
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:15,710
So minus 24/15 and we get
it being equal to 16/15.

188
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:22,390
And so using Green's theorem we
were able to find the answer

189
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,100
to this integral up here.

190
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,780
It's equal to 16/15.

191
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,960
Hopefully you found
that useful.

192
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,790
I'll do one more example
in the next video.

193
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,866
