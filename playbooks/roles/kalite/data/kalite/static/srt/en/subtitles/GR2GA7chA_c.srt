1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,480
In the last video we learned
a little bit about

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,130
photosynthesis.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,800
And we know in very general
terms, it's the process where

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,580
we start off with photons and
water and carbon dioxide, and

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,219
we use that energy in the
photons to fix the carbon.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,680
And now, this idea of carbon
fixation is essentially taking

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,390
carbon in the gaseous form, in
this case carbon dioxide, and

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,530
fixing it into a solid
structure.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,200
And that solid structure we fix
it into is a carbohydrate.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,390
The first end-product of
photosynthesis was this

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,830
3-carbon chain, this
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,880
But then you can use that to
build up glucose or any other

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,040
carbohydrate.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,630
So, with that said, let's try to
dig a little bit deeper and

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,710
understand what's actually going
on in these stages of

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,430
photosynthesis.

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,920
Remember, we said there's
two stages.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,020
The light-dependent reactions
and then you have the light

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,160
independent reactions.

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,370
I don't like using the word
dark reaction because it

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,600
actually occurs while
the sun is outside.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,100
It's actually occurring
simultaneously

23
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,300
with the light reactions.

24
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,160
It just doesn't need the
photons from the sun.

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,270
But let's focus first on the
light-dependent reactions.

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,660
The part that actually uses
photons from the sun.

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,900
Or actually, I guess, even
photons from the heat lamp

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,100
that you might have in
your greenhouse.

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,500
And uses those photons in
conjunction with water to

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:35,360
produce ATP and reduce
NADP plus to NADPH.

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,070
Remember, reduction is gaining
electrons or hydrogen atoms.

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,030
And it's the same thing,
because when you gain a

33
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,270
hydrogen atom, including its
electron, since hydrogen is

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,170
not too electronegative, you
get to hog its electron.

35
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,820
So this is both gaining a
hydrogen and gaining electron.

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,800
But let's study it a
little bit more.

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,660
So before we dig a little
deeper, I think it's good to

38
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,750
know a little bit about the
anatomy of a plant.

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,510
So let me draw some
plant cells.

40
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,530
So plant cells actually have
cell walls, so I can draw them

41
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,310
a little bit rigid.

42
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,830
So let's say that these are
plant cells right here.

43
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,290
Each of these squares, each of
these quadrilaterals is a

44
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,280
plant cell.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,890
And then in these plant cells
you have these organelles

46
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,880
called chloroplasts.

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,973
Remember organelles are
like organs of a cell.

48
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:24,230
They are subunits,

49
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,000
membrane-bound subunits of cells.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,300
And of course, these cells have
nucleuses and DNA and all

51
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,440
of the other things you normally
associate with cells.

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
But I'm not going to
draw them here.

53
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm just going to draw
the chloroplasts.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,970
And your average plant cell--
and there are other types of

55
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,680
living organisms that perform
photosynthesis, but we'll

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,590
focus on plants.

57
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,950
Because that's what we tend
to associate it with.

58
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,530
Each plant cell will contain
10 to 50 chloroplasts.

59
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,370
I make them green on purpose
because the chloroplasts

60
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,700
contain chlorophyll.

61
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,560
Which to our eyes,
appear green.

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,730
But remember, they're green
because they reflect green

63
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,090
light and they absorb red
and blue and other

64
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,040
wavelengths of light.

65
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,860
That's why it looks green.

66
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,600
Because it's reflecting.

67
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,480
But it's absorbing all the
other wavelengths.

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,590
But anyway, we'll talk more
about that in detail.

69
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,090
But you'll have 10 to 50 of
these chloroplasts right here.

70
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,930
And then let's zoom in on one
chloroplast. So if we zoom in

71
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,320
on one chloroplast. So
let me be very clear.

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,330
This thing right here
is a plant cell.

73
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,880
That is a plant cell.

74
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,420
And then each of these green
things right here is an

75
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:38,540
organelle called the
chloroplast. And let's zoom in

76
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,990
on the chloroplast itself.

77
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,200
If we zoom in on one
chloroplast, it has a

78
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,580
membrane like that.

79
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,170
And then the fluid inside of the
chloroplast, inside of its

80
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,610
membrane, so this fluid
right here.

81
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,360
All of this fluid.

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,430
That's called the stroma.

83
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,000
The stroma of the chloroplast.
And then within the

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,520
chloroplast itself, you have
these little stacks of these

85
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,530
folded membranes, These
little folded stacks.

86
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,459
Let me see if I can
do justice here.

87
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:22,510
So maybe that's one, two,
doing these stacks.

88
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,070
Each of these membrane-bound--
you can almost view them as

89
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,570
pancakes-- let me draw
a couple more.

90
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,970
Maybe we have some over here,
just so you-- maybe you have

91
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,650
some over here, maybe
some over here.

92
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,790
So each of these flattish
looking pancakes right here,

93
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,220
these are called thylakoids.

94
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,320
So this right here
is a thylakoid.

95
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,570
That is a thylakoid.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,090
The thylakoid has a membrane.

97
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,660
And this membrane is especially
important.

98
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,460
We're going to zoom in
on that in a second.

99
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,540
So it has a membrane, I'll color
that in a little bit.

100
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,720
The inside of the thylakoid, so
the space, the fluid inside

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,620
of the thylakoid, right
there that area.

102
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,220
This light green color
right there.

103
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,360
That's called the thylakoid
space or the thylakoid lumen.

104
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,530
And just to get all of our
terminology out of the way, a

105
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,090
stack of several thylakoids
just like that,

106
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,630
that is called a grana.

107
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,020
That's a stack of thylakoids.

108
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,840
That is a grana.

109
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,190
And this is an organelle.

110
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,170
And evolutionary biologists,
they believe that organelles

111
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,250
were once independent
organisms that then,

112
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,090
essentially, teamed up with
other organisms and started

113
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,350
living inside of their cells.

114
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,450
So there's actually, they
have their own DNA.

115
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,460
So mitochondria is another
example of an organelle that

116
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,480
people believe that one time
mitochondria, or the ancestors

117
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,960
of mitochondria, were
independent organisms. That

118
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,320
then teamed up with other cells
and said, hey, if I

119
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,230
produce your energy maybe
you'll give me

120
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,510
some food or whatnot.

121
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,150
And so they started
evolving together.

122
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,740
And they turned into
one organism.

123
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,460
Which makes you wonder what we
might evolve-- well anyway,

124
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,330
that's a separate thing.

125
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,510
So there's actually ribosomes
out here.

126
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,450
That's good to think about.

127
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,280
Just realize that at one point
in the evolutionary past, this

128
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,510
organelle's ancestor
might have been

129
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,370
an independent organism.

130
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,690
But anyway, enough about
that speculation.

131
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:29,760
Let's zoom in again on one of
these thylakoid membranes.

132
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,010
So I'm going to zoom in.

133
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,260
Let me make a box.

134
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,070
Let me zoom in right there.

135
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,990
So that's going to be
my zoom-in box.

136
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,770
So let me make it really big.

137
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,340
Just like this.

138
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,560
So this is my zoom-in box.

139
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,190
So that little box is the same
thing as this whole box.

140
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,180
So we're zoomed in on the
thylakoid membrane.

141
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,510
So this is the thylakoid
membrane right there.

142
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,810
That's actually a phospho-bilipd
layer.

143
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,020
It has your hydrophilic,
hydrophobic tails.

144
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,660
I mean, I could draw it
like that if you like.

145
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,810
The important thing from the
photosynthesis point of view

146
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,550
is that it's this membrane.

147
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,290
And on the outside of the
membrane, right here on the

148
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,940
outside, you have the fluid
that fills up the entire

149
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,540
chloroplast. So here you
have the stroma.

150
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,210
And then this space right here,
this is the inside of

151
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,620
your thylakoid.

152
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,780
So this is the lumen.

153
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,880
So if I were to color it
pink, right there.

154
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,020
This is your lumen.

155
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,780
Your thylakoid space.

156
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,390
And in this membrane, and this
might look a little bit

157
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,190
familiar if you think about
mitochondria and the electron

158
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,040
transport chain.

159
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,940
What I'm going to describe in
this video actually is an

160
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,770
electron transport chain.

161
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,260
Many people might not consider
it the electron transport

162
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,610
chain, but it's the same idea.

163
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,660
Same general idea.

164
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,280
So on this membrane you have
these proteins and these

165
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,235
complexes of proteins
and molecules

166
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:55,470
that span this membrane.

167
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,140
So let me draw a
couple of them.

168
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,596
So maybe I'll call this
one, photosystem II.

169
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:04,500
And I'm calling it that because
that's what it is.

170
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,820
Photosystem II.

171
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,310
You have maybe another
complex.

172
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,570
And these are hugely
complicated.

173
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,040
I'll do a sneak peek of
what photosystem II

174
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,670
actually looks like.

175
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,180
This is actually what
photosystem II looks like.

176
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,890
So, as you can see, it
truly is a complex.

177
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,460
These cylindrical things,
these are proteins.

178
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,580
These green things are
chlorophyll molecules.

179
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,020
I mean, there's all sorts
of things going here.

180
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,090
And they're all jumbled
together.

181
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,300
I think a complex probably
is the best word.

182
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,320
It's a bunch of proteins, a
bunch of molecules just

183
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,460
jumbled together to perform a
very particular function.

184
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,440
We're going to describe
that in a few seconds.

185
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,580
So that's what photosystem
II looks like.

186
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,850
Then you also have
photosystem I.

187
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,510
And then you have other
molecules, other complexes.

188
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,130
You have the cytochrome B6F
complex and I'll draw this in

189
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,120
a different color right here.

190
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,340
I don't want to get too
much into the weeds.

191
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,030
Because the most important thing
is just to understand.

192
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,790
So you have other protein
complexes, protein molecular

193
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,150
complexes here that also
span the membrane.

194
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,840
But the general idea-- I'll tell
you the general idea and

195
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,850
then we'll go into the
specifics-- of what happens

196
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:23,360
during the light reaction, or
the light dependent reaction,

197
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,950
is you have some photons.

198
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,150
Photons from the sun.

199
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,470
They've traveled 93
million miles.

200
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,320
so you have some photons that
go here and they excite

201
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,950
electrons in a chlorophyll
molecule, in a

202
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,770
chlorophyll A molecule.

203
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,920
And actually in photosystem II--
well, I won't go into the

204
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,720
details just yet-- but they
excite a chlorophyll molecule

205
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,060
so those electrons enter into
a high energy state.

206
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,160
Maybe I shouldn't draw
it like that.

207
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,690
They enter into a high
energy state.

208
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,080
And then as they go from
molecule to molecule they keep

209
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,760
going down in energy state.

210
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,780
But as they go down in energy
state, you have hydrogen

211
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,470
atoms, or actually I should say
hydrogen protons without

212
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,070
the electrons.

213
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,380
So you have all of these
hydrogen protons.

214
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,580
Hydrogen protons get pumped
into the lumen.

215
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,730
They get pumped into the lumen
and so you might remember this

216
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,210
from the electron
transport chain.

217
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,570
In the electron transport chain,
as electrons went from

218
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,160
a high potential, a high energy
state, to a low energy

219
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,110
state, that energy
was used to pump

220
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,240
hydrogens through a membrane.

221
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,290
And in that case it was in the
mitochondria, here the

222
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,750
membrane is the thylakoid
membrane.

223
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,750
But either case, you're creating
this gradient where--

224
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,650
because of the energy from,
essentially the photons-- the

225
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,330
electrons enter a high energy
state, they keep going into a

226
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,370
lower energy state.

227
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,870
And then they actually go to
photosystem I and they get hit

228
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,910
by another photon.

229
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,640
Well, that's a simplification,
but that's how you

230
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,190
can think of it.

231
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,350
Enter another high energy
state, then they go to a

232
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,905
lower, lower and lower
energy state.

233
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:59,540
But the whole time, that energy
from the electrons

234
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,760
going from a high energy state
to a low energy state is used

235
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,120
to pump hydrogen protons
into the lumen.

236
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,400
So you have this huge

237
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,440
concentration of hydrogen protons.

238
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,680
And just like what we saw in the
electron transport chain,

239
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,980
that concentration is then-- of
hydrogen protons-- is then

240
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,970
used to drive ATP synthase.

241
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,320
So the exact same-- let me see
if I can draw that ATP

242
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,310
synthase here.

243
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,880
You might remember ATP
synthase looks

244
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,160
something like this.

245
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,500
Where literally, so here you
have a huge concentration of

246
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,850
hydrogen protons.

247
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,010
So they'll want to
go back into the

248
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,230
stroma from the lumen.

249
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,900
And they do.

250
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,670
And they go through
the ATP synthase.

251
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,200
Let me do it in a new color.

252
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,820
So these hydrogen protons are
going to make their way back.

253
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,210
Go back down the gradient.

254
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,900
And as they go down the
gradient, they literally--

255
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,710
it's like an engine.

256
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,710
And I go into detail on this
when I talk about respiration.

257
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,020
And that turns, literally
mechanically turns, this top

258
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,850
part-- the way I drew it--
of the ATP synthase.

259
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,760
And it puts ADP and phosphate
groups together.

260
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,560
It puts ADP plus phosphate
groups

261
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,260
together to produce ATP.

262
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,740
So that's the general,
very high overview.

263
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,110
And I'm going to go into more
detail in a second.

264
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,500
But this process that I just
described is called

265
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,200
photophosphorylation.

266
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,450
Let me do it in a nice color.

267
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,850
Why is it called that?

268
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,390
Well, because we're
using photons.

269
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,460
That's the photo part.

270
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,270
We're using light.

271
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,190
We're using photons to excite
electrons in chlorophyll.

272
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,430
As those electrons get passed
from one molecule, from one

273
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,960
electron acceptor to another,
they enter into lower and

274
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,480
lower energy states.

275
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,170
As they go into lower energy
states, that's used to drive,

276
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,270
literally, pumps that allow
hydrogen protons to go from

277
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,240
the stroma to the lumen.

278
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,900
Then the hydrogen protons
want to go back.

279
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,100
They want to-- I guess you could
call it-- chemiosmosis.

280
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,770
They want to go back into the
stroma and then that drives

281
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,180
ATP synthase.

282
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,940
Right here, this is
ATP synthase.

283
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,270
ATP synthase to essentially
jam together ADPs and

284
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,810
phosphate groups
to produce ATP.

285
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,450
Now, when I originally talked
about the light reactions and

286
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,010
dark reactions I said, well the
light reactions have two

287
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,050
byproducts.

288
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,770
It has ATP and it also has--
actually it has three.

289
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,620
It has ATP, and it
also has NADPH.

290
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,340
NADP is reduced.

291
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,800
It gains these electrons
and these hydrogens.

292
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,060
So where does that show up?

293
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,670
Well, if we're talking about
non-cyclic oxidative

294
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,300
photophosphorylation, or
non-cyclic light reactions,

295
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,960
the final electron acceptor.

296
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,330
So after that electron keeps
entering lower and lower

297
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,445
energy states, the
final electron

298
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:12,090
acceptor is NADP plus.

299
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,340
So once it accepts the electrons
and a hydrogen

300
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,450
proton with it, it
becomes NADPH.

301
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,590
Now, I also said that part of
this process, water-- and this

302
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,010
is actually a very interesting
thing-- water gets oxidized to

303
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,270
molecular oxygen.

304
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,980
So where does that happen?

305
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,060
So when I said, up here in
photosystem I, that we have a

306
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:43,220
chlorophyll molecule that has
an electron excited, and it

307
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,510
goes into a higher
energy state.

308
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,410
And then that electron
essentially gets passed from

309
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,470
one guy to the next, that begs
the question, what can we use

310
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,550
to replace that electron?

311
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,340
And it turns out that we use,
we literally use, the

312
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,690
electrons in water.

313
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:03,870
So over here you literally
have H2O.

314
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,000
And H2O donates the hydrogens
and the electrons with it.

315
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,860
So you can kind of imagine it
donates two hydrogen protons

316
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,930
and two electrons to replace the
electron that got excited

317
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,860
by the photons.

318
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,780
Because that electron got passed
all the way over to

319
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,010
photosystem I and eventually
ends up in NADPH.

320
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,630
So, you're literally stripping
electrons off of water.

321
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,650
And when you strip off the
electrons and the hydrogens,

322
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,470
you're just left with
molecular oxygen.

323
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,300
Now, the reason why I want to
really focus on this is that

324
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,970
there's something profound
happening here.

325
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,500
Or at least on a chemistry
level,

326
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,600
something profound is happening.

327
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,510
You're oxidizing water.

328
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,480
And in the entire biological
kingdom, the only place where

329
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,290
we know something that is strong
enough of an oxidizing

330
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,400
agent to oxidize water, to
literally take away electrons

331
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,210
from water.

332
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,640
Which means you're
really taking

333
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,680
electrons away from oxygen.

334
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,830
So you're oxidizing oxygen.

335
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,120
The only place that we know
that an oxidation agent is

336
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,560
strong enough to do this
is in photosystem II.

337
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,560
So it's a very profound idea,
that normally electrons are

338
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,960
very happy in water.

339
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,660
They're very happy circulating
around oxygens.

340
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,310
Oxygen is a very electronegative
atom.

341
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,830
That's why we even call it
oxidizing, because oxygen is

342
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,230
very good at oxidizing things.

343
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,360
But all of a sudden we've
found something that can

344
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,480
oxidize oxygen, that can strip
electrons off of oxygen and

345
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,680
then give those electrons
to the chlorophyll.

346
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,140
The electron gets excited
by photons.

347
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,980
Then those photons enter
lower and lower and

348
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,940
lower energy states.

349
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,245
Get excited again in photosystem
I by another set

350
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:42,870
of photons and then enter lower
and lower and lower

351
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,750
energy states.

352
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,500
And then finally,
end up at NADPH.

353
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,140
And the whole time it entered
lower and lower energy states,

354
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,170
that energy was being used to
pump hydrogen across this

355
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,350
membrane from the
stroma to lumen.

356
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,250
And then that gradient is used
to actually produce ATP.

357
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,500
So in the next video I'm going
to give a little bit more

358
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,050
context about what this means
in terms of energy states of

359
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,040
electrons and what's at a higher
or lower energy state.

360
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,338
But this is essentially
all that's happening.

361
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:14,450
Electrons get excited.

362
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,859
Those electrons eventually
end up at NADPH.

363
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,650
And as the electron gets excited
and goes into lower

364
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,160
and lower energy states,
it pumps

365
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,290
hydrogen across the gradient.

366
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,900
And then that gradient is used
to drive ATP synthase, to

367
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,110
generate ATP.

368
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,270
And then that original electron
that got excited, it

369
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,480
had to be replaced.

370
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,200
And that replaced electron is
actually stripped off of H2O.

371
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,680
So the hydrogen protons and
the electrons of H2O are

372
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,300
stripped away and you're just
left with molecular oxygen.

373
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,070
And just to get a nice
appreciation of the complexity

374
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,970
of all of this-- I showed you
this earlier in the video--

375
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,250
but this is literally a-- I mean
this isn't a picture of

376
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,010
photosystem II.

377
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,830
You actually don't have
cylinders like this.

378
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,110
But these cylinders represent
proteins.

379
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,490
Right here, these green kind
of scaffold-like molecules,

380
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,390
that's chlorophyll A.

381
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:15,390
And what literally happens, is
you have photons hitting--

382
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,535
actually it doesn't always have
to hit chlorophyll A.

383
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:20,290
It can also hit what's called
antenna molecules.

384
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,550
So antenna molecules are other
types of chlorophyll, and

385
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,980
actually other types
of molecules.

386
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:31,510
And so a photon, or a set of
photons, comes here and maybe

387
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,440
it excites some electrons,
it doesn't have to be in

388
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,870
chlorophyll A.

389
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,220
It could be in some of these
other types of chlorophyll.

390
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,200
Or in some of these other I
guess you could call them,

391
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,670
pigment molecules that will
absorb these photons.

392
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,500
And then their electrons
get excited.

393
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,690
And you can almost imagine
it as a vibration.

394
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,870
But when you're talking about
things on the quantum level,

395
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,230
vibrations really don't
make sense.

396
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,410
But it's a good analogy.

397
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,970
They kind of vibrate their
way to chlorophyll A.

398
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,535
And this is called
resonance energy.

399
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,440
They vibrate their way,
eventually, to chlorophyll A.

400
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,950
And then in chlorophyll A, you
have the electron get excited.

401
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,620
The primary electron acceptor
is actually this molecule

402
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,460
right here.

403
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,470
Pheophytin.

404
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,100
Some people call it pheo.

405
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,380
And then from there, it keeps
getting passed on from one

406
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,200
molecule to another.

407
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,690
I'll talk a little bit more
about that in the next video.

408
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,730
But this is fascinating.

409
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,390
Look how complicated this is.

410
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,210
In order to essentially excite
electrons and then use those

411
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,060
electrons to start the
process of pumping

412
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,200
hydrogens across a membrane.

413
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,300
And this is an interesting
place right here.

414
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,950
This is the water
oxidation site.

415
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,370
So I got very excited about the
idea of oxidizing water.

416
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,140
And so this is actually where
it occurs in the photosystem

417
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,240
II complex.

418
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,220
And you actually have this very
complicated mechanism.

419
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,880
Because it's no joke to actually
strip away electrons

420
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,110
and hydrogens from an actual
water molecule.

421
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,010
I'll leave you there.

422
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,870
And in the next video I'll talk
a little bit more about

423
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,890
these energy states.

424
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,380
And I'll fill in a little bit of
the gaps about what some of

425
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,990
these other molecules that act
as hydrogen acceptors.

426
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,470
Or you can also view
them as electron

427
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,350
acceptors along the way.
