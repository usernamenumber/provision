1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,610
We now know how to name
aldehydes and ketones, and

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,845
what I want to do in this video
is show a mechanism for

4
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:06,710
actually creating one.

5
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,230
In particular, we're going
to create a ketone.

6
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,060
So let's say we've got ourselves
some benzene, and in

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,020
the first step of this reaction,
the benzene is just

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,219
going to sit and watch.

9
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,870
We've got some benzene
and we've got

10
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,260
some of acetyl chloride.

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,530
So it looks almost like an
aldehyde or a ketone, but

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,630
instead of having a carbon chain
or a hydrogen, we're

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,790
going to have a chlorine
atom right over there.

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,350
So this is acetyl chloride,

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,660
sometimes called acyl chloride.

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,670
This is acetyl chloride, and
we're going to have an

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,420
aluminum chloride catalyst. And
a catalyst means that it

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,110
participates in the reaction,
but it enters the reaction and

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,000
it exits the reaction as
the same molecule.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,890
So it just catalyzes it.

21
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,040
It doesn't disappear.

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,130
It just changes halfway,
but then goes back

23
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,590
to what it was before.

24
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,820
So we have some aluminum
chloride and it's bonded to

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,630
one, two, three chlorines.

26
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,260
Now, the first step of this
reaction is to turn this

27
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,420
acetyl chloride into a good
electrophile, turn it into

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,270
something that's really good at
nabbing electrons, so good

29
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,310
that it can break the
aromaticity of the benzene

30
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,960
ring and essentially add itself
to the benzene ring.

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,200
This is actually the same
mechanism we saw with

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,510
electrophilic aromatic
substitution.

33
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,130
I always have trouble
remembering the name, but I

34
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,910
always imagine it's
electrophilic substitution.

35
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,230
Either way, but it's a very
similar mechanism.

36
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,730
And actually, what we're going
to show in this video is

37
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,670
called Friedel-Crafts acylation,
because this right

38
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:44,710
here is called an acyl group and
we're essentially going to

39
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,200
acylate the benzene ring.

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,360
We're going to add this
group right here

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,750
to the benzene ring.

42
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,340
So enough of what's
going to happen.

43
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,480
Let's actually see it happen.

44
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,340
So the first thing to realize,
this aluminum chloride, the

45
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,350
aluminum in it is electron
deficient.

46
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,470
And at first, if you just look
at the Periodic Table, you

47
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,100
have these chlorines over here,
pretty electronegative.

48
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,860
Aluminum is in the same row, but
chlorine's way more to the

49
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,110
right, so it's more
electronegative, so the

50
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,340
chlorines are going to hog the
electrons in this molecule.

51
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,586
The chlorines are going to hog
electrons, so the aluminum is

52
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,640
going to have a partial
positive charge.

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,650
Chlorines will have slightly
partial negative charge.

54
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,930
On top of that, you see aluminum
is a Group 3 element,

55
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,040
one, two, three, so it has
three valence electrons.

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,790
You see that right here, one,
two, three, nowhere close to

57
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,730
the magic number of eight.

58
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,990
Even when it covalently bonds
with these chlorines, it can

59
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,790
only pretend like it
has six electrons.

60
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,630
It can kind of pretend like it
has these chlorine electrons

61
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,830
over here, but that only
gets it to six.

62
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,760
So it would really like to have
more electrons to get

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,620
closer to that magic
eight number.

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,840
So what you can imagine is a
situation where this chlorine

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,170
on the acetyl chloride, it's
already hogging this green

66
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,300
electron from this carbon.

67
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,160
It was already doing that.

68
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,920
It's more electronegative, so
this thing over here will

69
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,200
actually be given
to the aluminum.

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,550
And so it will then have a
bond with the chloride.

71
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,160
So if that happened, what does
our reaction look like?

72
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,690
So if that happened, what does
everything look like?

73
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,850
Our aluminum, our aluminum
chloride, or what was formerly

74
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,520
aluminum chloride, now just
gained an electron, and with

75
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,030
it, it is now bonded to
another chlorine.

76
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,890
So it is now bonded to another
chlorine, and since it gains

77
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,700
an electron-- let me
make it very clear.

78
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,400
This is an L.

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,870
My penmanship is
deteriorating.

80
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,830
That's an L.

81
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,660
And since this aluminum gained
an electron, it now has a

82
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,260
negative charge.

83
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,700
And normally, a negatively
charged thing isn't that

84
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,980
stable, but these guys are
electronegative, so they might

85
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,850
hog a lot of that
negative charge.

86
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,110
And on top of it, aluminum
can now pretend like

87
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,600
it has eight electrons.

88
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,200
It has one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

89
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,830
When you covalently bond to
someone, you can kind of

90
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,630
pretend like you have their
electrons as well.

91
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,120
So now you have this anion
that was formed from the

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,480
aluminum chloride, and now
the acetyl chloride

93
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,580
will look like this.

94
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,570
Scroll down a little bit.

95
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,350
Let me make it clear.

96
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,754
We're in the next step
of the reaction.

97
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:21,730
   

98
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,250
What was formerly the acetyl
chloride has now lost the

99
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,200
chloride, so it's now really
just an acyl group.

100
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,070
So you have the carbonyl bonded
to a CH3, a methyl,

101
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,150
just like that.

102
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,520
This guy lost his electrons,
so now he

103
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,180
has a positive charge.

104
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,240
And this is actually
not that stable.

105
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,850
you're going to see it's
actually highly reactive.

106
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,200
It's a very good electrophile.

107
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,810
It wants to steal other
people's electrons.

108
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,640
But it can exist for a short
amount of time, especially

109
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,200
because it is resident
stabilized.

110
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,190
You say, how is it resident
stabilized?

111
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,070
Well, this oxygen over here has
two electron pairs that I

112
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,580
didn't draw before.

113
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,680
And let me draw the second
one in a different color.

114
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,620
It has two electron
pairs like that.

115
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,230
So you can imagine
the situation.

116
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,570
This carbon is already-- he has
a positive charge, and his

117
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,590
oxygen is more electronegative.

118
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,880
It's already hogging
his electrons.

119
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,280
Maybe he wants to give
back a little bit.

120
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,190
Say, hey, this is positive.

121
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,910
All of the electrons are
hanging out here.

122
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,440
They'd be attracted to the
positive, and you could

123
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,440
imagine one of these
electrons being

124
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,970
given back to the carbon.

125
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:31,870
And if that happened then we
have another residence form

126
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,770
that looks like this.

127
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,295
So this was our original
molecule.

128
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:36,820
   

129
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,010
That's our original, or
what it looked like.

130
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,390
We still have this double bond
right over there or that pair

131
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:43,950
of electrons.

132
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,960
Now, this pair of electrons
now forms another bond.

133
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,540
This electron here is now
on the oxygen end.

134
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,720
This electron over here is now
on the carbon end, and now

135
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,500
they have a triple bond.

136
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,540
And what happened?

137
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,870
This positive carbon gained an
electron, so it's now neutral.

138
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,180
And the neutral oxygen
lost an electron,

139
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,140
so it is now positive.

140
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,260
And you could imagine, this
is not a very stable-- you

141
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,430
wouldn't see this just floating
around by itself, but

142
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,625
it does stabilize this
entire configuration.

143
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,950
It stabilizes this molecule.

144
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,580
So you can show that these
are alternate residently

145
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,700
stabilized structures
right there.

146
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,720
But as I said, these aren't
super stable.

147
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,180
This guy really, really,
really wants to react.

148
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,050
And now this is where benzene
comes into the mix.

149
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,030
And actually, let me draw a
little dividing line here,

150
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,410
just so we know that
this was a separate

151
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,330
stage of our reaction.

152
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,500
So that was the first stage.

153
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,590
Then we go over here and now
benzene comes into the mix.

154
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,520
The benzene was floating
around.

155
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,340
So we have our benzene floating

156
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,140
around, just like that.

157
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,790
And then I'm going to draw
one of the hydrogens

158
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,760
on one of the carbons.

159
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,510
All of these carbons have
hydrogens on them.

160
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,420
I just won't draw them all.

161
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,320
It just make things
complicated.

162
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,050
But this guy we said is a really
good electrophile, and

163
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,640
you have to be a really good
electrophile to attract

164
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,870
electrons from a benzene ring,
to break it's aromaticity.

165
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,630
But if it bumps into this guy in
just the right way, at just

166
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,620
the right angle, you could
imagine that this electron on

167
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,200
this carbon right here gets
swiped by the acyl group.

168
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,970
   

169
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,830
So then what do we have?

170
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,840
So now I will go back
in this direction.

171
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,075
So you have what was
a benzene ring.

172
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:36,050
   

173
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,420
We can draw the double
bonds here and here.

174
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,920
   

175
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,320
And we, of course, have
this hydrogen.

176
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,680
But now this bond, which was
a double bond there, is now

177
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,070
bonded to the acyl group.

178
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,900
So it has that blue electron
that the acyl group nabbed.

179
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,960
And let me draw the
acyl group.

180
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,250
And I'll flip it over so that
we have the methyl on the

181
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,020
right-hand side.

182
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,930
So it's carbonyl bonded
to a CH3.

183
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,050
It was positive.

184
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,420
It now gained an electron.

185
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,510
It is now neutral.

186
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,350
This carbon over here lost
an electron, so it is now

187
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,950
positive, so it is now
positively charged.

188
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,050
Now, we mentioned the aluminum
chloride is a catalyst, so it

189
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,610
won't just sit around
there as the anion.

190
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,730
It has to go back to being
aluminum chloride, so let's

191
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,730
bring the aluminum chloride
back into the scene.

192
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,200
So we have our aluminum
chloride.

193
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,080
Let me copy and paste it.

194
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,150
So we have our aluminum chloride
here, and so you can

195
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,830
imagine that the benzene ring
wants to go back to being

196
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:54,910
aromatic, so this electron right
here on the hydrogen

197
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,630
might really want to go back
to this carbon right over

198
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,540
here, this carbocation.

199
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,790
At the same time, if this anion
now passes the hydrogen

200
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,960
at just the right angle at the
right time while this guy's

201
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,310
attracted to this carbon, this
chlorine can give this green

202
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,350
electron to the hydrogen
nucleus, which is

203
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,620
really just a proton.

204
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,940
And then the hydrogen's electron
can be taken up by

205
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,000
what was this carbocation.

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,780
And then what do we have?

207
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:30,070
Then we have a situation where
our benzene ring is reformed.

208
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,970
We have the aromaticity again.

209
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,630
We have that double bond, that
double bond, and now we have

210
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,980
this double bond again, although
now it's using the

211
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,350
electron from the hydrogen.

212
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,940
And now we've substituted this
hydrogen with essentially this

213
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,740
acyl group right over here.

214
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,600
So we have a carbon double
bonded to an oxygen bonded to

215
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,860
a methyl group.

216
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,885
And now the aluminum, or this
anion, lost its electron, so

217
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:05,790
it goes back to just being
straight-up aluminum chloride.

218
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,100
It goes back to just being
straight-up neutral,

219
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,130
electron-deficient aluminum
chloride.

220
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,480
And we're done.

221
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,050
We've just acylized this benzene
ring, and that's why

222
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:32,245
this mechanism is called
Friedel-Crafts acylation.

223
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:35,220
   

224
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,460
And Friedel is actually a former
president of MIT, and I

225
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,680
did some reading on this.

226
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,120
Apparently, he did not have a
PhD, but because he discovered

227
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,450
Friedel-Crafts acylation and
this Friedel-Crafts alkylation

228
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,380
as well, they said, hey, you
know, this guy's a smart dude.

229
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,710
Let's make him the
president of MIT.

230
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,620
But I just wanted to show you
that this is a reaction for

231
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,710
creating a ketone.

232
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,500
So this ketone that we've
created is acetophenone, which

233
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,740
we've seen before, which we've
learned is a common name for

234
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,940
this molecule that we learned
in the first ketone video.

235
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,940
And I'll write it in purple.

236
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,190
Acetophenone.

237
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,010
   

238
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,610
And we're done!

239
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:17,734
