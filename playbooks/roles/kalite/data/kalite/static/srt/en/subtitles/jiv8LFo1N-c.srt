1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,052
so the first thing we need to do is take our wire

2
00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:09,163
we've already stripped a quarter of an inch of insulation off the end

3
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:12,035
and we're going to put our spade connector on it

4
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:16,627
squeeze it tight and make sure that we have that crimped joint

5
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:21,799
working for us alright, so now we're going to connect that

6
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:26,702
to the pole in our motor before we do we'll trim it off

7
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:30,079
looks like we need about 4 inches and we have about a 1/4 inch exposed

8
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:36,109
and we'll take that 1/4 inch and we'll wrap it around the motor there

9
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:37,410
the little contact there to the motor

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,433
we wanna make sure that we loop it through that connection

11
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,530
and we're gonna take a little bit of solder

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,848
and we're gonna solder it to that connection

13
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:46,182
make sure that wire is held in place

14
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:50,372
alright, so we did the exact same thing to the other side, connected the motor

15
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:54,618
to the pole on the switch on the other side the same way so that they're symmetrical

16
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:56,451
so now we're gonna take another piece

17
00:00:56,451 --> 00:01:00,619
of wire that's about 4 inches long and we're stripping the ends off

18
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:04,644
of actually two pieces of wire there and we're gonna loop it through

19
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:08,142
loop one of them through the other motor and crimp it in place

20
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:11,795
make sure its wrapped around pretty tightly there

21
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:15,290
and solder it in place so that it stays where it needs to go

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,919
and the other side of the wire we're gonna twist with the wire we just cut

23
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:22,189
twist it together and we're gonna wrap

24
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:26,877
that in around on the other connection on the motor on the other side

25
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:30,715
so we'll have another wire there

26
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:36,871
and so once thats looped through our motor

27
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:40,372
the contact on our motor we'll solder that in place

28
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:44,187
okay, so now we can be sure that those two wires that are connected

29
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,036
to our motors are not gonna come loose so we should have 3 extra wires

30
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:51,533
at this point and we've got a bunch of other parts

31
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:54,337
still left but we're gonna start to connect our switches

32
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:59,234
so the first thing we're gonna do is well, we'll do our led switches

33
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:03,297
and we're gonna just twist together the leads of the two resistors

34
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:05,763
that we've selected and we'll loop those around

35
00:02:05,763 --> 00:02:08,857
connect them to one of our contacts on our sliding switch

36
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:12,215
now this is a single pole double throw switch

37
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,966
and we don't really need a double throw switch

38
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:17,048
we only need a single throw so we went ahead and bent one of the contacts

39
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:20,703
out of the way 'cause we don't need it so we're gonna solder the resistors down

40
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:23,713
to one side of the switch and what's important is that you can

41
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:27,376
if you do use a single pole double throw switch

42
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,709
with the 3 contacts you need to solder to two contacts

43
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,325
and the two contacts you should solder to should

44
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:35,700
be right next to each other

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,623
if you solder to the two outside contacts it wont work appropriately

46
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:45,212
so we're gonna take the 20 gauge hook up wire that we had connected before and

47
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:49,704
we're twisting it on to the other contact and this is the hook up wire from

48
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:55,255
the one that's connected to the positive terminal on the battery there

49
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:59,170
and now we're gonna get our switch and we're

50
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,314
getting it lined up and we're gonna put some hot glue down there's about

51
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:07,115
a nickel sized bunch of hot glue that we just put down

52
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:10,672
and we're holding it in place, the holding of the switch in place.

53
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:12,214
it takes a while for the hot glue to dry

54
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:16,310
alright, so now we have our switch in

55
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,994
we're gonna try to route our wire so they're a little bit more out of our way

56
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:25,332
and that's good. now we're goint to at this point

57
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:28,789
we're gonna take our other switch and we're gonna connect it but

58
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:30,795
before we do that we need to put a little bit of solder

59
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:34,696
on our battery connection in the back here.

60
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:37,223
and this is going to allow us to take the 3 volts

61
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:40,165
from our batteries cuz the batteries are connected in series

62
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:44,087
and drop it down to 1.5 volts

63
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,768
because our motors are gonna run a little slower

64
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,511
on 1.5 volts, so that's good for us.

65
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:52,585
because they run really fast already

66
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:56,715
okay so we're crimping that connect our wire on to our

67
00:03:56,715 --> 00:04:01,785
switch and again we just wanna make sure that

68
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:04,462
the loop on the wire is fits really tightly around

69
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:07,826
the post on our switch and we're soldering that on place

70
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:10,288
making sure that it's got a nice good connection and

71
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:16,448
so this is the other wire, this is the wire

72
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:18,950
from our motor that we're gonna connect to the

73
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,202
this will be the on/off switch

74
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:24,221
the previous switch was the i should say

75
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,790
the switch for the leds. and sometimes its hard

76
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,911
to get the wires to stay in place, you can see they're

77
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:30,590
bouncing around for me there. alright now

78
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,011
that that solder is in place

79
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:36,862
now my switch has what it needs to do it's job.

80
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,751
alright, so i'm gonna put down a little bit of hot glue

81
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:42,828
and make sure that switch is held in place

82
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:45,036
right there, and now we're gonna take the

83
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:46,964
other end of the wire was a little bit long

84
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:48,450
i'm gonna strip off just a little bit

85
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,047
and we are going to solder that wire to the

86
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:57,985
exposed contact on the battery there and then again

87
00:04:57,985 --> 00:05:02,955
that's gonna allow us to run the motors at a

88
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:05,956
little bit lower speed cuz we're using a lower voltage.

89
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:09,684
alright, lets see if we can get this to work and

90
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,829
it takes a little bit doing on this and

91
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,065
one thing you gotta be really careful of

92
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:16,461
is that the if you hold the soldering iron on

93
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:20,790
that part too long it will overheat the plastic and around

94
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,896
the connections, it's really important you don't do that

95
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:27,347
i used to i always like to put a little bit of hot glue

96
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:29,408
on top of that and then when the hot glue hardens

97
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:31,282
it helps to kepp the wires from pulling out.

98
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:33,371
in the next video we're gonna make our antennas

99
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,521
and connect 'em to the single pole double throw switches

100
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:37,965
in the front of the bot so that spout can turn around

101
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:41,000
when he bumps into something.
