1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,667
An ecologist surveys the age of about 100 trees

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:05,322
in a local forest.

3
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:07,757
He uses a box and whiskers plot

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:10,090
to map his data, shown below.

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,816
What is the range of tree ages that he surved?

6
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:17,000
What is the median age of a tree in the forest?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,004
So first of all, let's just...

8
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:19,066
let's make sure we understand

9
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,082
what this box and whiskers plot is even about.

10
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:24,082
This is really a way of seeing the spread

11
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:25,661
of all of the different data points,

12
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:27,246
which is the age of the trees,

13
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:28,834
and to also give other information,

14
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:29,981
like what is the median and

15
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:32,267
where does most... where do most of the ages

16
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:33,419
of the trees sit.

17
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:34,953
So this whisker part ...

18
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:36,578
so you can see this black part is a whisker,

19
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,896
this is the box,

20
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:39,500
and this is another whisker over here.

21
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,421
The whiskers tell us essentially the spread

22
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:43,711
of all of the data.

23
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,370
So it says the lowest data point in this sample

24
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,213
is an 8 year old tree

25
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:51,405
I'm assuming the axis down here is in years.

26
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:55,147
And it says the highest, the oldest tree, right over here,

27
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:55,983
is fifty years.

28
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:57,967
So if we want the range,

29
00:00:57,967 --> 00:01:00,412
and we think of range in a statistics point of view.

30
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:02,441
We're thinking of the highest data point

31
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,221
minus the lowest data point.

32
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:07,036
So it's going to be 50 - 8.

33
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:09,637
So we have a range of 42.

34
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,333
So that's what the whiskers tell us.

35
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,491
It tells us that everything falls between 8 and 50 years,

36
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,250
including 8 years and 50 years.

37
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,229
Now what the box does, the box starts at ...

38
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,572
Let me explain it to you this way:

39
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:23,894
the mid .. This line over here this is the median

40
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:26,962
this right over here is the median.

41
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:31,045
And so, half of the ages are going to be less than the median

42
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:33,367
we see right over here that the median is 21.

43
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,550
So this box and whiskers plot tells us

44
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,894
that half of the trees are going to be less than 21

45
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:42,069
and half are older than 21.

46
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,652
And then these end points, right over here,

47
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:47,299
these are the medians for each of those sections.

48
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,297
So this is the median for all of the trees

49
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:51,154
that are less than the real median,

50
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,151
or less than the main median.

51
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:55,473
So this is the middle of all of the trees

52
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:57,284
that are less than 21,

53
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,303
this is the middle age for all of the trees

54
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:02,067
that are greater or older than 21.

55
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,841
And so, these essentially are splitting ...

56
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:08,290
We're actually splitting all the data into four groups:

57
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,030
this we'll call the first quartile,

58
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,981
so I'll call it Q1 for the first quartile,

59
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:15,309
maybe I'll do 1Q.

60
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,506
This is the first quartile,

61
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:19,981
or roughly a fourth of the trees,

62
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:21,453
because the way you calculate it sometimes

63
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:22,958
a tree ends up in one point or another.

64
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,061
About a fourth of the trees end up here,

65
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,984
a fourth of the trees are between 14 and 21,

66
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:30,814
a fourth are between 21 and it looks like 33,

67
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:32,720
and then a fourth are in this quartile.

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,619
So we call this the first quartile, the second quartile,

69
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:39,820
the third quartile and the fourth quartile.

70
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,938
So to answer the question,

71
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:43,636
we already did the range,

72
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:47,160
there's a 42 year spread between the oldest and the youngest tree

73
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,040
and then the median age of a tree in the forest

74
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,467
is at 21.

75
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,668
So even though you might have trees that are

76
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:55,122
as old as 50,

77
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:57,352
the median of the forest is acutally closer

78
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,289
to the lower end of our entire

79
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:02,733
our entire spectrum of all the ages.

80
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:06,421
So if you view median as your central tendancy measurement

81
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:09,112
it's only at 21 years.

82
00:03:09,112 --> 00:03:10,605
You can even see it.

83
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:12,108
It's closer to the left of the box

84
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,320
and closer to the left, the end of the left whisker

85
00:03:15,320 --> 99:59:59,999
than the end of the right whisker.
