1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,930
I don't want to beat a dead
horse by showing you all of

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,610
the different ways to find a
determinant, but it might be

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,110
useful to beat this dead horse
because you'll see it done in

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,830
different ways, in different
context.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,230
And I thought I would at least
show you that what we have

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,190
been covering, so far, is very
consistent with a way of

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,880
determining, or finding
determinants, that you might

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,370
have been exposed to in your
Algebra Two class.

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,250
It's called the rule
of Sarrus.

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,470
Let me just prove it for you.

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,520
Let's say we want to
find a determinant.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,850
Let's say you want to find
this determinant.

14
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:35,870
So our matrix is a, b,
c, d, e, f, g, h, i.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,980
We know how to do this.

16
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,180
This is equal to, let's just
go down that first row, a

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:49,710
times the determinant of e,
f, h, i minus b times the

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:57,830
determinant of d, g, f,
i plus c times the

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,065
determinant of d, e, g, h.

20
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:03,320
   

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,989
And what are these equal to?

22
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,160
This is going to be equal to
a, so let me write this, a

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,460
times ei minus fh.

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,150
   

25
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:24,645
And this is going to be minus
b times dI minus fg.

26
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:33,160
This is going to be plus c times
dh minus eg and if we

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:41,550
multiplied this out we get this
is equal to aei minus afh

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:51,610
minuses bdi plus right, minus
times a minus, plus bfg plus

29
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:56,120
cdh minus ceg.

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,840
Now let me group the positive
and the negative terms.

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,980
So this term is positive, this
term is positive and that term

32
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,600
is positive.

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:12,410
So we have this being equal
to aei plus bfg plus cdh.

34
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,900
Those are our positive terms.

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,640
And then our negative
terms are here.

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,250
We have that term, that
term, and that term.

37
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:29,450
So we have minus afh minus
bdi minus ceg.

38
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,320
So this is a formula for the
determinant of this matrix

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,800
right here.

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,170
Let's see what it actually
looks like.

41
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,570
Let me rewrite it.

42
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,570
Let me rewrite our matrix.

43
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,790
We do it in green.

44
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:50,560
So we have a, b, c,
d, e, f, g, h, i.

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,230
We wanted to find
its determinant.

46
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,590
So let me show you something
interesting here.

47
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,750
aei is what?

48
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,930
aei is a product of this guy,
this guy, and that guy.

49
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,270
So, you're essentially
going along that

50
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,340
diagonal right there.

51
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,490
Now what is bfg?

52
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,600
You're going this guy, this guy,
and then you're going all

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,650
the way down to this guy.

54
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,320
So it's like if you imagine that
when you come out of this

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,490
side, you come out
of this side.

56
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,830
There's some video games where
you go out one end and you end

57
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,610
up showing up on the other
end like that.

58
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,770
It would also be a diagonal.

59
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,070
Or even a better way to
visualize it, let me redraw

60
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,080
these two columns.

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,810
Let me augment this
determinant.

62
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,770
It's not official terminology,
but I think you'll get what

63
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,410
I'm trying to do.

64
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,060
So if I write these first
two columns again. a, d,

65
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,430
g, and b, e, h.

66
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,780
This guy right here bfg, it's
this one right here, this

67
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,420
diagonal right there.

68
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,800
And then you might guess
what's about to happen.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,290
Where is cdh?

70
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,990
It's this diagonal.

71
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,210
It's that diagonal
right there.

72
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,800
So you take this product, add it
to this product, add it to

73
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,770
this product.

74
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,330
And then you subtract
these guys.

75
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,320
Now what are these guys?

76
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,570
Where is the afh?

77
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,710
   

78
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,830
That one right there.

79
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,770
So you subtract out afh, and
then you subtract out bdi.

80
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,380
bdi is that one right there.

81
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:23,220
And then you have ceg, which
is this one right there.

82
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,330
So the Rule of Sarrus, sounds
like something in

83
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,510
The Lord of the Rings.

84
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:37,560
The Rule of Sarrus is
essentially a quick way of

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,450
memorizing this little
technique.

86
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,560
You write the two columns
again, you say, ok, this

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,620
product plus this product plus
this product, minus this

88
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,220
product minus this product
minus that product.

89
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,625
Let's actually do it with the 3
by 3 matrix to make it clear

90
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,800
that the Rule of Sarrus
can be useful.

91
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,990
So let's say we have the
matrix, we want the

92
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:08,710
determinant of the matrix, 1, 2,
4, 2, minus 1, 3, and then

93
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,740
we have 4, 0, minus 1.

94
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,720
We want to find that
determinant.

95
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,550
So by the Rule of Sarrus,
we can rewrite

96
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,830
these first two columns.

97
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,360
So 1, 2, 2, minus 1, 4, 0.

98
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,610
We rewrote those first
two columns.

99
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,950
And to figure out this
determinant we take this guy.

100
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,670
What is this going to be?

101
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,410
1 times minus 1 times minus 1.

102
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,280
That is just a 1.

103
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,220
Right, the minuses cancel out.

104
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,320
Plus this guy, plus this
product right here.

105
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,890
I should draw a little
bit neater.

106
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,380
So what is this?

107
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,130
2 times 3 times 4.

108
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,500
2 two times 3 is 6.

109
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,680
6 times 4 is 24, plus 24.

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,480
And then we take this
guy right here.

111
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,110
4 times 2 times 0, anything
times 0 is a 0.

112
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,570
So that's going to be plus 0.

113
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,810
And then we subtract
out these guys.

114
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,780
So you have 4 times
4, times minus 1.

115
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,276
That's minus 16.

116
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:09,700
It's minus 16, but we're
going to be on the

117
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,350
minus side of things.

118
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,300
So it's 4 times minus 1
times 4, is minus 16.

119
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,340
But since were going to
do a minus on it, it's

120
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,310
going to be plus 16.

121
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,660
So it's 16.

122
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,230
Then you have a 0
times 3 times 1.

123
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,510
That of course is
going to be 0.

124
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,350
Would be a minus 0, but
we can ignore it.

125
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,270
So we can say plus 0 or
minus 0 same thing.

126
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:37,020
Then you have a minus
1 times 2 times 2.

127
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,880
So that's 4 times minus
1 which is minus 4.

128
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,050
When you go in this direction,
from the top right to the

129
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,780
bottom left, you are
subtracting.

130
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,380
So this would be a minus 4 but
since we're subtracting, this

131
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,530
becomes a plus 4.

132
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,390
So the value of our determinant
is equal to, by

133
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,230
the Rule of Sarrus, we're
going to have

134
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,370
16 plus 4 is a 20.

135
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,960
20 plus 25 which
is equal to 45.

136
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,120
So that actually is, I'd have
to say, a faster way of

137
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,580
computing this 3 by
3 derivative.

138
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,330
And I just want to show you this
is completely equivalent

139
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,200
to the definition that I
introduced you to a couple

140
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,450
videos ago.

141
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:17,670
