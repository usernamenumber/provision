00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:04,818
A conversation with Dr. Darius Arya & Dr. Beth Harris

2
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:09,741
We know that when the archologists look 
for traces of ancient cultures, they dig down

3
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:14,558
and we often read about
how the ancient ground level was much lower.

4
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:16,065
So how did this happen?

5
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:19,693
What gets layered on top of ancient cultures?

6
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,426
People back then are like us today.

7
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:24,459
Every action that we take, 
everything that we do, everything that we purchase,

8
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:26,693
we're gonna leave something behind,
there's gonna be a trace.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,306
The Romans were ultimately very efficient

10
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:32,101
so they said often times 
if there is destruction from a fire:

11
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:36,212
"Let's level off those buildings, 
make the ground floor into the basement

12
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:39,216
or simply level off the building 
and put all that rubble around, smooth it

13
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:42,048
and we now have the foundations
for the later structures."

14
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:47,560
So, Romans didn't necesserily look 
at their cities after disasters: fires, floods, earthquakes,

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,617
the way that we do.

16
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:51,685
So after Katrina in United States, we digged it out.

17
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,700
But for the Romans, that's too much effort.

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,735
Why you're gonna haul that material away?

19
00:00:55,735 --> 00:00:59,469
Just level off and jack your city up to a higher level.

20
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:02,103
So, standing here in the Forum,

21
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,765
we notice we go down into the Forum

22
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,047
and we look up at the streets around us.

23
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:09,315
So, are we at an ancient ground level now?

24
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:13,251
Yes, and even beneath this 
are several other layers of ancient Rome.

25
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:17,361
So, we'd go down another 20 feet
to get to the archaic layers

26
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:20,592
and every monument that you see has a precedent.

27
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:25,064
Like this is Basilica Julia. 
This was built after fire in 283 A.D.

28
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:29,656
It replaces the one that's burnt down that was built 
by Julius Ceasar and completed by Augustus.

29
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:33,342
It in turn replaced a second century B.C. Basilica

30
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:36,847
It in turn replaced earlier republican houses.

31
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,512
So you've got layer upon layer upon layer.

32
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:42,271
So how do archeologists 
make the decision when to stop digging?

33
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,724
Feels like you could dig
and just go further back in history.

34
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:48,890
So, when you're looking 
for opportunities to go down further

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,579
such as someone's put a cut in the floor

36
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,348
that allows you then to go down to an earlier level

37
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:58,431
and what they end up mostly satisfying 
themselves with for the Forum Piazza today.

38
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:03,126
What you see is largely on the Augustan
to second century A.D. levels.

39
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:08,111
But there are many opportunities 
throughtout the area in the Roman Forum

40
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:10,574
where they can go down to earlier and earlier levels.

41
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:14,942
So finding places to do that where you don't destroy what is existing now, that you could say?

42
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:15,538
Exactly.

43
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:16,002
Thanks.

44
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:20,002
Thank you.
