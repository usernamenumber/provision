Determine whether the ordered pairs (3, 5) and (1, -7) are solutions to the inequality 5x - 3y â‰¥ 25. So, we can literally just try each of these ordered pairs. We could try what happens when x is equal to 3 and y is equal to 5 in this inequality and see if it satisfies it, and then we could try it for 1 and -7. So let's do that first, let's do it first for 3 and 5. So, when x is 3, y is 5--let's see if this actually gets satisfied--so we get 5 times 3--5 times 3--let me color code it--so this is five--I want to it in this color-- five times three minus three times five. Let's see if this is greater than or equal to twenty-five. So five times three is fifteen. And then from that we're going to subtract fifteen. And see if that is greater than or equal to 25 and there's that question mark there because we don't know 15 - 15 there is zero. So we get the expression 0 is greater than or equal to 25, this is not true- zero is less than 25. so this is not true so this ordered pair is not a solution to this inequalit
