1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,640
In the home stretch.

3
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,910
Problem 14.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:13,200
If n and p are integers greater
than 1-- I didn't

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,420
write that they're integers--
and if p is a factor of both n

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:33,130
plus 3 and n plus 10, what
is the value of p?

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,610
So n and p are integers greater
than 1 and p is a

8
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,400
factor of both n plus
3 and n plus 10.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,860
This is interesting.

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:52,890
So that means that n plus 3 is
equal to some number times p,

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,710
where k is just some
random number.

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,560
And we also know that n plus
10 is also equal to some--

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,700
maybe, probably, definitely
some other number times p.

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,720
And so we could subtract
3 from both

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,730
sides in this equation.

16
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,330
We'd get n is equal to k
times p, some number

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,330
times p minus 3.

18
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,300
And we also could do it here.

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,640
We can subtract 10
from both sides.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,520
We say n is equal to some other
number times p minus 10.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,660
And I don't know where
this is going.

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,550
I'm just really playing
around with this.

23
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,630
So let's see.

24
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,130
So both of these things
are equal to n.

25
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,560
What are we trying
to solve for?

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,460
We're trying to solve for p.

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,560
So some number times p minus 3
is equal to some other number

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,480
times p minus 10.

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,360
Let me see where that gets me.

30
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:52,300
So kp minus 3 is equal to
m times p minus 10.

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,870
Let's add 10 to both sides
of this equation.

32
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:05,340
You'll get kp plus 7 is
equal to m times p.

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,460
Now, this is interesting.

34
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,460
So if I multiply some integer
times p, right?

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,590
So this is some multiple
of p, right?

36
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,860
This is actually n plus 3.

37
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,910
But if I have some multiple of
p right here and I add 7 to

38
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,610
it, I get another
multiple of p.

39
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,210
So that means that 7 has
to be divisible by p.

40
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:38,060
There are only two numbers
that 7 is divisible by.

41
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,885
1 and 7.

42
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:42,210
And it's not going to be 1,
because it tells us that n and

43
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,030
p are both greater
than 1, right?

44
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,120
So p has to be 7.

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,670
p is equal to 7, which
is choice B.

46
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:59,960
And so the way I think about it
is just when you add 10 to

47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,590
a number-- think
of it this way.

48
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,090
Ignore this whole n plus 3.

49
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,390
Let's just say n plus 3, let's
just say that we'll

50
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,030
call this Q, right?

51
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,020
We're saying p is a factor
of Q, right?

52
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,110
And then if Q is n plus 3, then
this would be Q plus 7.

53
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,590
I hope I'm not confusing you.

54
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,540
So this is divisible by p.

55
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,040
And then when you add 7 to it,
it's also divisible by p.

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,490
So p has to be 7, because when
I add 7 to-- think of it this

57
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:43,020
way: if n plus 3 was-- let's
say this was 21.

58
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,000
Not n, n plus 3 was 21, then
n would be what, 18?

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,220
n is 18, n plus 3 is 21, and
n plus 10 would be 28.

60
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,330
And these are both
divisible by 7.

61
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,340
So that's another way
you could do it.

62
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,350
You could actually just
try out the numbers.

63
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,500
But hopefully, that'll give
you the intuition.

64
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,590
But the big clue is some
multiple times p plus 7 is

65
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,800
equal to another multiple
times p.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,140
So we know that p has to be 7
because p has to be divisible

67
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,830
into 7 and greater than 1.

68
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,570
And there's only one number
that's greater than 1 and that

69
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,510
is a factor of 7.

70
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,360
And that's B.

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,950
Or that's 7, sorry.

72
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,160
Next problem.

73
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,950
That was tricky, I think.

74
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,860
Problem 15.

75
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,680
In the queue shown above,
points A, B and C are

76
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,840
midpoints of the three edges.

77
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,110
Which of the following angles
has the least measure?

78
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,980
Oh man, this is going to
be a lot of drawing.

79
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,670
This might take the whole
time, but I'll

80
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,430
try my best. OK.

81
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,760
B, C and E.

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm going to draw it big
just so-- actually, I'm

83
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,330
drawing it too big.

84
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,930
   

85
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,540
I'll do it the best I can.

86
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:17,130
   

87
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:17,590
OK.

88
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,315
And then they have these dotted
lines in the back.

89
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:30,440
   

90
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,570
OK, now they have--
let me draw this

91
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,510
in a different color.

92
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,760
This is point x.

93
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,800
   

94
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,620
This is point y.

95
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,970
They draw a bunch of points.

96
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,850
B, C, and E are the midpoints.

97
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,170
So this is point B.

98
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,100
This is point A.

99
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,430
This is point C.

100
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,700
Point D.

101
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,720
Point E.

102
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,020
And everything they drew
essentially starts at x, goes

103
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,785
to one of these points, and then
goes back to y, right?

104
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:12,590
It goes from x to B
to y, x to A to y.

105
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,520
All the choices go to each
of these points and

106
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,290
then go back to y.

107
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,510
And what they want to
know is, which angle

108
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,740
has the least measure?

109
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,130
So the way we could think about
this is, all of these

110
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:31,136
angles-- we could just draw this
part-- sorry, if this was

111
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:33,680
x, this is one of the messier
things I've ever drawn, this

112
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,020
is y and then the other angles,
you know it's going to

113
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,955
go to some point and
then come back.

114
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:40,800
And what we want to know
is, when do we

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,540
get the least angle?

116
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,540
Think of it this way, the longer
this base angle is, the

117
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,000
longer this is, the
smaller the angle.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,730
Because this is the angle
we're measuring.

119
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,950
So we want to make
this angle, this

120
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,235
length as long as possible.

121
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:59,900
The length from whatever letter
we are to y, right?

122
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,150
So B to y is very short,
so this angle

123
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,980
would be pretty big.

124
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,420
A to y is even bigger.

125
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,195
C to y is even bigger
than that.

126
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:10,530
D to y is actually the biggest.
This is the biggest

127
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,900
distance, right?

128
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,746
So this will be the
smallest angle.

129
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:23,282
So that's ydx or xdy,
so that's choice D.

130
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:26,750
And remember, the underlying
intuition is, if I were to--

131
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,500
let me do the colors so you know
what I'm saying-- this

132
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,440
line, if I were to draw that,
that would be here.

133
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,520
I'm saying that corresponds
to that right there.

134
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,155
That's x.

135
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:38,130
That's y.

136
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,610
And then we're taking a
point from x to one of

137
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,980
these points, right?

138
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,770
xby, xay, xcy, and whatever
point it is, the way we get

139
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,460
the smallest angle is
if we make this

140
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,330
line as long as possible.

141
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,830
And you can visualize that.

142
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,090
Take this point further and
further out and this angle

143
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,040
gets smaller and smaller
and smaller.

144
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,130
So if you look at it that way,
what is going to be the

145
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,110
longest distance y to which
of these points?

146
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,480
y to C is the same as y to E.

147
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,905
y to B is very short.

148
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:12,990
y to A id a little longer.

149
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,260
y to C is a little longer.

150
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,320
y to D is the longest
distance.

151
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,365
So the least angle will be,
if this point is D, xdy.

152
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:23,428
And that's choice D.

153
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:26,510
Let me see if I can squeeze
problem 16 in here.

154
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,360
Otherwise, I'll do it
in the next video.

155
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,930
Problem 16.

156
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:41,130
if xy is equal to 7, x minus y
is equal to 5 then x squared y

157
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,370
minus xy squared is
equal to what?

158
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,430
All right, so we know what
xy is and we know

159
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,410
what x minus y is.

160
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,220
So let's watch this.

161
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,360
Factor an x out of here.

162
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,830
You get the same thing as x
times xy, minus-- let's factor

163
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,890
a y out of here.

164
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,410
This is the same thing
as y times xy, right?

165
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,430
All I did is I factored
a y out.

166
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,790
And now let's factor
the x minus y out.

167
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,680
This is the same thing as xy
times x minus y, right?

168
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,500
I'm just factoring the xy out.

169
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,460
You could do it in reverse.

170
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,840
You can distribute the xy and
you'd get this up here.

171
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,070
And this equals what?

172
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,730
xy is 7.

173
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,190
And x minus y, it gives
us right there, is 5.

174
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,420
7 times 5 is 35.

175
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,885
That's choice D.

176
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:32,600
And we are done with Test 7.

177
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,260
I will see you in Test 8.

178
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,800
