99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's see how resonance structure is going to affect the hybridization of atoms.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and therefore, affect the geometry.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so, let's check out the most famous example of this.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that is in amicaged linkage.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if you remember from the earlier videos of the functional groups,
