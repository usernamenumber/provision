1
00:00:00,362 --> 00:00:08,170
In triangle ABC, AB is equal to 13, BC is equal to 14, and AC is equal to 15.

2
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:14,316
Let me just draw that. It looks like a pretty involved problem

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,332
So it looks something like that

4
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:34,381
Let's say this is triangle ABC

5
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:42,203
They tell us AB is equal to 13, BC is equal to 14 and AC is equal to 15

6
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:48,033
and then they tell us point G is the intersection of the medians.

7
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:51,707
If you've watched the video on medians and centroids you might recognize

8
00:00:51,707 --> 00:00:54,721
that the intersection of the medians is just the centroid.

9
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:57,981
Let me just show that here.

10
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:05,153
The line from B to the midpoint of AC is a median.

11
00:01:05,153 --> 00:01:08,871
Let me draw that a little cleaner.

12
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:10,639
So that is a median.

13
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:22,239
Now the line from A to the midpoint of BC is also a median.

14
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:33,576
And finally the line from C to the midpoint of AB is a median.

15
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:38,685
We learned -- if you've watched the video on medians and centroids --

16
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:42,133
that these three medians always intersect at a point called the centroid.

17
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:50,364
They even imply that in the question. So that right there is point G.

18
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:59,267
Point A', B', and C' are the iamges of A, B, and C after a 180 degree rotation about G.

19
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:06,600
What is the area of the nion of the two regions enclosed by the triangles ABC and A'B'C'?

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,216
Let's draw the second triangle.

21
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:16,162
What we want to do is rotate each of these about G 180 degrees.

22
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:23,221
So if A is here and we rotate it 180 degrees about G,

23
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:28,591
it's going to end up just as far from G on that side.

24
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:36,672
So A' is going to be right over there.

25
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:44,067
B is this far right now, if you rotate it 180 degrees,

26
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:49,157
B' will then be about that far.

27
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:52,896
Same for C. If you rotate it 180 degrees,

28
00:02:52,896 --> 00:03:02,671
it's going to go about here. So you have C'.

29
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:07,733
So if we wanted to draw A'B'C', it's going to look like this.

30
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:11,295
Here's my best attempt at it.

31
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:24,548
This line should be parallel to that line

32
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:27,600
since it's been rotated by 180 degrees.

33
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,438
And this line [C'B'] should be parallel to this line [BC],

34
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,733
and this line [C'A'] should be parallel to that line [AC].

35
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:42,888
It seems like it's going to be relevant.

36
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:48,554
So they're asking, they want the area of the union of the two triangles.

37
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:59,667
So it's the area of this star. This slightly skewed or tilted star of David

38
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:05,179
I'm not doing this in real time; it took me a while before I did this problem

39
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,924
before it jumped out at me.

40
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:09,438
Kind of knowing that most of these problems don't require

41
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:10,920
really hard mathematics.

42
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,614
A lot of the time you just kind of have to see something

43
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:16,667
or rearrange things and the answer jumps out.

44
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:20,017
It's also the case with this one here.

45
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:23,533
And the thing that jumps out (and the motivation for making this video)

46
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:33,043
I showed you in the last video that if you have the median of a triangle

47
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:35,900
and the centroid of the trianlge is over here,

48
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:43,200
this distance [GA] is twice the distance from the centroid to the midpoint [of BC]

49
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,715
and the same on all 3 sides.

50
00:04:49,715 --> 00:05:01,229
But this distance [AG] is also the same as this whole entire distance [A'G]

51
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:05,701
This distance has been rotated 180 and degrees

52
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:10,369
and if this distance [G-midpoint of BC] is half of that one [AG]

53
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:19,133
this is exactly halfway between this point [G] and that point [A']

54
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:23,895
Another way to think about it:

55
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:27,308
we know that this length over here is equal to this length over here,

56
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:31,976
which is equal to this length over here, which is equal to this length over here

57
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:37,061
And so you start seeing, maybe, some triangles will jump out.

58
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:42,634
Let's see if I can draw these triangles.

59
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:49,484
I have this triangle up here.

60
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:53,849
This is actually going to be a median of this triangle over here

61
00:05:53,849 --> 00:06:05,227
It's going to be the same as the median or equivalent line of this triangle over here

62
00:06:05,227 --> 00:06:10,149
It's actually going to be an altitude -- we're kind of drawing a rhombus

63
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:15,699
and the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.

64
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:22,456
So this altitude right here is going to be the same as this altitude over here.

65
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:31,442
This side is the exact same thing as this side.

66
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,857
Let me be careful here.

67
00:06:33,857 --> 00:06:37,154
We already know that this side is going to be the same thing as this side

68
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:41,218
We know these two sides are the same because this is acting as a median of this triangle

69
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:48,718
We already know that this yellow side I'll draw two marks is the same thing

70
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:51,733
as that yellow side down there.

71
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:56,496
If this is the same as this, and this is the same in both triangles,

72
00:06:56,496 --> 00:07:06,458
we know that this side must be the same thing as this side,

73
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:16,535
which also must be the same thing as this side and this side over here.

74
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:20,436
Another way to think about it, this triangle is going to have the exact same area

75
00:07:20,436 --> 00:07:22,085
as this triangle.

76
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:24,639
This triangle is going to have the same exact area as this triangle.

77
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,288
Or, you could view it another way.

78
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:35,297
This purple triangle right over here is going to be a congruent triangle to this triangle over here.

79
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:39,941
All of its sides are exactly the same. They share one of them.

80
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:43,981
We could use the same argument to say that this triangle right over here

81
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:54,035
is completely congruent to this triangle right over there.

82
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:55,359
They have all of the same sides.

83
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:59,520
In fact, we even know that they are congruent to these two up here.

84
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,815
So these are all congruent.

85
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:19,949
Let's think about this triangle right over here.

86
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:27,751
We know that this distance, the distance when started talking about medians,

87
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:32,534
from the centroid to the base, that's the exact same distance

88
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:39,129
over here , if you were to draw a parallel line.

89
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:44,631
It's just that this line up here and this line over here are parallel

90
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:50,841
If this is parallel to this, and they're intersecting at the same point

91
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:54,652
I won't go into the depth of proving they're parallel -- it's not too hard to prove.

92
00:08:54,652 --> 00:09:01,652
You can show that this distance is the same as this distance.

93
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:08,688
We share this magenta side right over here,

94
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:13,790
so we know that this side is going to

95
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,256
be the same as that side

96
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,345
Or we know that this triangle is going to be

97
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:21,157
the same thing as that triangle.

98
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:26,242
And then we can take the mirror image.

99
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:28,355
Using essentially the same argument,

100
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:31,048
that's going to be the same thing as this triangle over here.

101
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,138
And it's a similar argument to show that that's going

102
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:35,832
to be the same thing as that triangle over there.

103
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:42,124
And then do it on the other side.

104
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,237
I think you see where this is going!

105
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:46,735
All of these triangles are congruent.

106
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:04,148
There's actually multiple ways you can make that argument.

107
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:07,597
The same argument we made to show that these magenta triangles are congruent,

108
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:13,750
we could make to say that this distance is exactly half of this entire distance.

109
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,443
Same argument to tell you that this triangle's congruent

110
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:17,790
to that that triangle.

111
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,993
And that one to that one.

112
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:23,200
So that entire shape --

113
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,168
and actually I was a little handwavy about it --

114
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:33,231
I think you can see it actually wouldn't be hard to do a rigorous proof.

115
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:37,202
But this shape, this slanted star of david

116
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:48,557
is made up of [counts to 12] congruent triangles.

117
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:53,363
12 congruent triangles.

118
00:10:53,363 --> 00:10:58,611
Now, how many of these congruent triangles originally made up our triangle ABC?

119
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:12,729
[counts to 9]

120
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:17,976
So we have 12 congruent triangles in the star

121
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:30,422
we had 9 congruent triangles in ABC,

122
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:37,922
so the area of the star is just going to be 12/9 the area of ABC.

123
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:41,219
So if we can figure out the area of ABC,

124
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:44,401
we know that each triangle will have 1/9 that area.

125
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:49,788
Multiplying by 12 we'll get the area of the actual star.

126
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:53,990
So let's figure out the area of triangle ABC.

127
00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:02,814
Let me redraw the triangle.

128
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:07,017
There are formulas for figuring out the areas of triangles if you know the sides.

129
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,918
I always forget them, but I do remember the law of cosines.

130
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:15,980
It helps me derive those formulas.

131
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:22,876
Area of a triangle is 1/2 base * height,

132
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:27,079
so if we could figure out this height,

133
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,421
we could multiply 1/2 and 14, or multiply it by 7 and

134
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:34,718
then we would be able to figure out the area of this entire triangle.

135
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:36,506
How can we do that?

136
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:44,421
Let's just break out a little trigonometry.

137
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:48,372
Let's take this to be theta over here.

138
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:50,926
The law of cosines tells us that

139
00:12:50,926 --> 00:12:55,732
the opposite side of the angle squared, so 15 squared

140
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:59,773
is equal to the sum of the other sides squared

141
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:02,327
(13 squared + 14 squared)

142
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:07,598
minus 2 times the product of these two sides

143
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:10,467
so times 13 times 14

144
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:15,957
times the cosine of theta

145
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:18,650
Now, what is the cosine of theta?

146
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,528
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,

147
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:26,568
so that's this side over our hypotenuse.

148
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:36,181
So let's just call this length over here x.

149
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:41,545
So cosine of theta is x over 13.

150
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:45,911
So if you could solve for x you could then solve for h using the Pythogorean Theorem

151
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:52,203
These two characters cancel out, and we are left with

152
00:13:52,203 --> 00:13:56,708
15 squared is 225, 13 squared is 169

153
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:07,203
14 squared -- we have 140 + 40 + 16 = 196

154
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:16,840
minus 28 x

155
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,227
So let's solve for x.

156
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:28,960
We'll do a couple of things. We'll subtract 225 from both sides

157
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,878
and I'm going to add 28x to both sides

158
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:43,357
On the left hand side we are left with 28 x is equal to

159
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:44,703
and we have to do a little bit of math

160
00:14:44,703 --> 00:15:00,145
[does arithmetic aloud] 365. Did I do that right?

161
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:07,204
And from that we want to subtract 225

162
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:10,663
It is going to be 140

163
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:19,208
so x is going to be 140 divided by 28

164
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:25,060
Let's think about it. It goes 5 times. 5 times 20 is 100,

165
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,659
5 times 8 is 40, so 5 times 28 is 140

166
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:33,860
So x in this situation is equal to 5.

167
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,900
So we can use that information to figure out this height.

168
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,969
We know from the pythagorean theorem that

169
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,221
5 squared plus h squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared.

170
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:47,235
It's equal to 169

171
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:53,365
or h squared = 169 -25 = 144.

172
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:58,032
h is equal to 12

173
00:15:58,032 --> 00:16:00,865
Now we can figure out the area of the triangle.

174
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:06,438
The area sometimes denoted by brackets [ABC] is equal to

175
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:13,311
1/2 times 14 times 12

176
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,302
which is the same as 7 times 12, which is equal to 84

177
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:26,802
That's just the area of these 9 congruent triangles.

178
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:34,302
We know that the area of the whole thing will be 12/9 of that

179
00:16:34,302 --> 00:16:50,811
So the area of the star is going to be equal to 12/9 times 84

180
00:16:50,811 --> 00:17:02,050
12/9, dividing numerator and denominator by 3 is the same as 4/3

181
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,694
3 does go into 84. How many times? Is it 28?

182
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:15,517
Let me make sure. 2*3 = 6, so yup, 28 times.

183
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:19,418
So this is equal to 4 times 28

184
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:23,598
Which is going to be 80 plus 32

185
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:28,079
which is equal to 112.

186
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,282
Let me make sure I did that right

187
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:37,553
4 times 20 is 80 plus 32 is 112.

188
00:17:37,553 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are done!
