2
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:10,092
Monica and Brian here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the Greek and Roman Galleries.

3
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:13,574
We're going to talk a little bit about Hellenistic sculpture.

4
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:20,790
So Hellenistic sculptural period, after the Classical period, more like 2nd century B.C.E.?

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,975
That's right.

6
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:27,093
Here we're standing before a bronze statue of Eros sleeping.

7
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,926
The two things that I notice right away about this:

8
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:31,981
One, he's bronze - we don't see alot of bronze

9
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:38,254
No we don't. This is a rare surviving bronze sculpture. One of the few to survive intact from antiquity.

10
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:43,873
Bronze was often later melted down for other purposes.

11
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:48,107
So many original Greek sculptures that were made out of bronze don't survive for that reason.

12
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:53,306
So lots of reproductions in marble, workshops kind of turning these things out.

13
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:58,476
Yes, lucky for us Roman sculptors really like Greek bronzes and copied them often in marble.

14
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,143
Later, the original bronzes were lost.

15
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:07,460
I'm glad you said that because this is one of the statues that was very loved, we're told, in Roman gardens.

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,097
So wealthy Romans would want a copy of the Sleeping Eros.

17
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:14,478
This one I think dates from the Roman period.

18
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:21,232
So despite the fact that being a Greek Hellenistic original, it's listed on the nameplate as maybe from the Augustan period.

19
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:26,899
So the two things that strike me, the first was that it's made of bronze, and the second is that it's a child.

20
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:31,282
Yes, we don't see that very much in earlier Greek sculpture.

21
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:37,466
Classical period seems so focused on the young male, the heroic, the soldier or the athlete type.

22
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:38,586
That's right.

23
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:44,047
And we see a shift in the Hellenistic period to a kind of realism, of showing real and every day, day-to-day life.

24
00:01:44,047 --> 00:01:46,082
Here in this case a sleeping child.

25
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:50,905
Yes, it's Eros. But it's a child looking very much like a child with all it's kind of plumpness.

26
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:56,630
So we might imagine Eros in the Classical period triumphing or somehow inspiring greatness.

27
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,744
That's right.

28
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:00,221
Here he's dozing. Yes. It's very cute.

29
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:05,647
It is. And that's not a word we would associate with Classical Greek sculpture.

30
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:09,531
No. If someone said 'I saw some Greek sculpture, it was very cute' you would think they were crazy.

31
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:10,809
That's right.

32
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:13,448
So, Hellenistic art gives us this moment of repose.

33
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:17,380
And I like compositionally too how it's very spread out.

34
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,630
It's not so forced in terms of it's balance or symmetry as we might expect.

35
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,979
Right. Again, the letting go of that idealized perfection that we see in the Classical period.

36
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:36,167
In the Hellenistic period, if we walk back in the other direction we see that not only is there a focus on the young but a focus on the old.

37
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:43,349
That's right. Again, this interest in the Hellenistic period of showing things the way they appear in real life.

38
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:46,081
Not always the perfect. Not always the ideal.

39
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:50,716
So this predates Roman concern with verism, which is focused very much on ancestors.

40
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:52,833
But these aren't really portraits of individuals.

41
00:02:52,833 --> 00:03:00,566
No. And here we see this old market woman, who is not meant to represent a particular old market woman, but this type, a realistic type.

42
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:08,120
Now as cute as the Sleeping Eros is, she's uh, maybe past her beautiful years as a polite way to say it.

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,270
Yes. She's stooped over. We see her mouth open, her toothless mouth opened.

44
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,011
The drapery falling sort of slackly over her body.

45
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,822
She looks tired.

46
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:24,270
She is tired as she carrying the goods to the market to sell to make her living.

47
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,887
So like the Sleeping Eros, not very heroic.

48
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:28,441
That's right.

49
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:35,190
Well, I mean heroic I guess in a sense that we would say 'here is a woman doing the chores', 'here is a woman doing what enobles her in daily life'.

50
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,502
But not heroic in a Classical sense.

51
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:39,190
Right, and not in an ideal sense.

52
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,497
So part of a broader trend in the Hellenistic period to expand what it means to be human.

53
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:45,956
Old and young.

54
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:48,238
That's right. Yes. And showing all of that.

55
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:51,728
Showing even athletes, showing them stooped over and injured.

56
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:58,380
Old women, young children, the broad spectrum of humanity is of interest to Hellenistic sculptors.

57
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:05,810
Now another trend in Hellenistic art; we saw the Sleeping Eros with the reclining figure with the arm and the leg draped off.

58
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,389
Here, she's up on a podium but she seems like she's coming at us.

59
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,836
She does. There's alot of movement.

60
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:18,676
In the late Classical and Hellenistic styles the forms really break out of the envelope of space that has kind of enclosed them previously.

61
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:29,354
So we get figures reaching out, or legs hanging off, or movement in space that we don't see in that kind of composed and idealized Classical style.

62
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:36,921
It suggests to me a matter of time as well, that the timelessness of Classical art here extends into the moment.

63
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:44,491
So the idea that the posture that she has has to be resolved, right. It's a continuation of a walking that isn't at rest.

64
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:45,774
That's right.

65
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:49,889
So she's actually got a little bit of a diagonal to her as she moves into our space.

66
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,770
Not a posture she could endure for a long period of time. Right.

67
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,241
Whereas the Classical figures looked very much poised and very restrained, very at rest.

68
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:58,578
Definitely.

69
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:02,286
So in the Hellenistic period, your expansion of what it means to be human, with the old and the young.

70
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:10,065
Two statues which might challenge our ideas about Greco-Roman art are certainly jewels that nestle into this Greco-Roman courtyard.

71
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:19,200
