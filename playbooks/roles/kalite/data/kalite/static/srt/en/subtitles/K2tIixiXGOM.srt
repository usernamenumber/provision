1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420
   

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,010
In the last video I promised
you that I would show a

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,190
concrete example of
electrophilic aromatic

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,870
substitution.

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,119
So let's do that right here.

6
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,550
So let's say we have
some benzene.

7
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:15,510
   

8
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,000
And it's a solution with
some molecular bromine.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,770
So I'll draw the molecular
bromine like this.

10
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,530
So it's one bromine
right there.

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,310
It has one, two, three,
four, five, six,

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,350
seven, valence electrons.

13
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,619
And it's bonded to another
bromine that has one, two,

14
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,370
three, four, five, six,
seven electrons.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,170
These two guys in the middle
are bonded to each other.

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,110
They can kind of act as an
electron pair or make bromines

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,840
feel like they have
eight electrons.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,540
This guy thinks he has
a magenta one.

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,680
That guy thinks he
has the blue one.

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,360
And let's say we have
some iron bromide

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,600
in our mix as well.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,760
And what we're going to see is
that this is going to catalyze

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,450
the reaction.

24
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,290
So the iron bromide.

25
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,300
We have some iron and
it's bonded to three

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,960
bromines just like that.

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,960
So we haven't seen iron
bromide much.

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,250
But the way I think about it is,
bromine molecules are much

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,120
more electronegative
than the iron.

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,360
So even though these look like
fair covalent bonds, if we had

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,830
thought about oxidation, these
guys are going to be hogging

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,490
the electrons.

33
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,930
This actually would have an
oxidation number of three.

34
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,820
And in reality they are
hogging the electrons.

35
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,260
They are more electronegative.

36
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,070
So the way I think about is
that this iron will have a

37
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,590
slightly positive charge.

38
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,320
Because the electrons are being
hogged away from it.

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,430
So it wouldn't mind to
gain an electron.

40
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,810
Or it might want to accept
an electron.

41
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,150
It might want to act
as a Lewis acid.

42
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,090
Remember a Lewis acid will
accept an electron.

43
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:53,050
So this might want to
act as a Lewis acid.

44
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,340
So who can it nab
electrons from?

45
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,340
Well maybe it can nab an
electron from this bromine

46
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,970
right here.

47
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,220
And I'm not saying that this
always going to occur, but

48
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,460
under the right circumstances
if they bump into each other

49
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,150
with the right energies
it can happen.

50
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,509
So this electron-- let me do it
in a different color that I

51
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,040
haven't used yet, this green
color-- let's say this

52
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,140
electron right here gets
nabbed by that iron.

53
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,380
Then what do we have?

54
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,300
Well then we have a situation,
we have this bromine-- the

55
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,380
blue one-- with one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven

56
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,760
valence electrons.

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,420
We have the magenta bromine
with one, two,

58
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,150
three, four, five.

59
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,380
Now it only has the sixth
valence electron right here.

60
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,760
The seventh got nabbed
by the iron.

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,900
So the iron has the seventh
valence electron and then you

62
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,860
have the rest of the molecule.

63
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,670
So then you have your iron and
it's attached, of course, to

64
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,920
the three bromines.

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,170
   

66
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,300
Just like that.

67
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,670
And then our bonds, these
guys were bonded.

68
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,700
They still are bonded.

69
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,410
And now these guys are bonded.

70
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,370
These were in a pair.

71
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,330
This electron jumped
over to the iron.

72
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,990
And now we have another bond.

73
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,220
But because this bromine lost an
electron-- it was neutral,

74
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,715
it lost an electron-- it now
has a positive charge.

75
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:15,810
   

76
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,200
And the iron, now that it gained
this electron, now has

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,450
a negative charge.

78
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,690
   

79
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,490
So let's think about what's
going to happen now.

80
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,140
Now we're going to bring the
benzene into the mix.

81
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,380
So let me redraw the benzene.

82
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,470
   

83
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,200
And we have this double bond,
that double bond, and then

84
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,860
just to make things clear, let
me draw this double bond with

85
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,400
the two electrons
on either end.

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,410
So we have the orange electron,
you have your green

87
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,810
electron right over there, and
I'll draw the double bond as

88
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,810
being green.

89
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,170
Now let's think about this
molecule right here.

90
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,300
We have a bromine with
a positive charge.

91
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,920
Bromines are really, really,
really, electronegative.

92
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,590
You might see them with a
negative charge, but the

93
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,960
positive charge, it really wants
to grab an electron.

94
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,680
And in the right circumstances,
you can imagine

95
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,060
where it really wants to grab
that electron right there.

96
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,430
So maybe, if there was
just some way it

97
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,820
could pull this electron.

98
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,030
But the only way it could pull
this electron is maybe if

99
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,170
this-- because if it just took
that electron than this

100
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,930
bromine would have a positive
charge, which isn't cool.

101
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,725
So this bromine maybe would
want to pull an electron.

102
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:32,565
If this guy gets an electron,
then this

103
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,770
guy can get an electron.

104
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,160
So you can imagine this thing
as a whole really, really

105
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,290
wants to grab an electron.

106
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,640
It might be very good
at doing it.

107
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,520
So this is our strong
electrophile.

108
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,290
So what actually will happen
in the bromination of this

109
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,210
benzene ring-- let me draw some
hydrogens here just to

110
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,050
make things clear.

111
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,520
We already have hydrogens
on all of these carbons.

112
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,580
Sometimes it's important to
visualize this when we're

113
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,640
doing electrophilic aromatic
substitutions.

114
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,400
So we already have a hydrogen
on all of these molecules.

115
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,840
So maybe this is so
electrophilic it can actually

116
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,860
break the aromatic ring, nab
this electron right there.

117
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,700
So maybe, this electron right
there goes to the bromine.

118
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,460
Maybe I should even
do it this way.

119
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,290
Just to make it clear.

120
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,520
Kind of replaces that one.

121
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,380
Although, obviously the
electrons are a bit fungible.

122
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,720
So maybe it goes over there.

123
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,880
And then when it goes to this--
let me make it clear

124
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,180
it's going to the
blue bromine.

125
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,860
So the electron right here
goes to the blue bromine.

126
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,790
If the blue bromine gets an
electron then it can let go of

127
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,960
this blue electron.

128
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,360
So this blue electron
can then go to this

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
bromine right over here.

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,010
And then what is our situation
look like?

131
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,590
Well if we have that, then let
me draw our benzene ring

132
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:58,130
first. We have our benzene ring
first. So let me draw the

133
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,380
benzene ring.

134
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,160
   

135
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,830
This double bond, that
double bond.

136
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,830
Let me draw all of
the hydrogens.

137
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,260
I want to do them in purple.

138
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,930
So we have one hydrogen, two
hydrogens, three hydrogens,

139
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,480
four hydrogens, five hydrogens,
and six hydrogens.

140
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,290
This orange electron is still
with this carbon right here.

141
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,600
   

142
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,850
But that electron got nabbed
by this bromine.

143
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:36,830
So that electron got nabbed by
this bromine right over here.

144
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,140
I've kind of flipped it around
and now it has its other six

145
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,890
valence electrons.

146
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,240
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

147
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,830
The electron got taken away
from this carbon.

148
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,720
So now that carbon will have
a positive charge.

149
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,330
But we saw in the last video,
it's actually resonance

150
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:50,980
stabilized.

151
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,380
That electron could
jump there.

152
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,420
That electron can jump there.

153
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,970
So it's not as stable
as a nice aromatic

154
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,020
benzene ring like this.

155
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,510
But it's not a ridiculous
carbocation.

156
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,920
It's stable enough for it to
exist for some small amount of

157
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,000
time while we kind of hit
our transition state.

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,510
And then this molecule
over here, what's it

159
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,420
going to look like?

160
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,810
Well this bromine had
a positive charge.

161
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,050
Now it gained an electron.

162
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,860
Let me draw it.

163
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,360
So you have your bromine.

164
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,670
It gained an electron.

165
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,090
So now it is neutral again.

166
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,960
So let's see, it had the one,
two, three, four, five, six.

167
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,700
Now it gained this
blue electron.

168
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,680
So now it's seven valence
electrons.

169
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,190
Back to being neutral.

170
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,570
It's bonded to the
iron bromide.

171
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,980
   

172
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,700
Let me draw the bromines.

173
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,300
One, two, three.

174
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,060
And so we've given this blue
bromine to the benzene ring.

175
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,240
But it's not happy here.

176
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,960
It doesn't want to break
it's aromaticity.

177
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,830
It wants an electron back.

178
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,860
So how can it gain
an electron back?

179
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,140
Well this thing-- actually let
me make it very clear.

180
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,950
Let me make it clear.

181
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,265
This thing had a negative
charge.

182
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:14,250
   

183
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,590
So you can imagine-- and we had
this electron right here.

184
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,740
So maybe this thing right
over here can now act

185
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,310
as an actual base.

186
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,590
It can nab a proton off
of the benzene ring.

187
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,060
Just like we saw in
the last video.

188
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,610
This is now the base.

189
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,429
This whole complex, to some
degree, acted as a strong

190
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,470
electrophile.

191
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,179
Now that we got rid of one of
bromines, this thing might

192
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,539
want to grab a proton now, since
it is positive and will

193
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,690
act as our base.

194
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,600
And will nab one of
these protons.

195
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,390
If it nabs the proton,
than the leftover

196
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,940
electron is still there.

197
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,220
That electron is still there.

198
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,470
Let me do that in a
different color.

199
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,950
I'll do it in red.

200
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,270
That electron is still there.

201
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,440
And then that electron can
be given to that original

202
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,400
carbocation and we'll have a
nice aromatic ring again.

203
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,710
So how would that look?

204
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:08,650
So you could imagine a situation
where this electron,

205
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,650
this green electron right
here, gets given to the

206
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,030
hydrogen nucleus.

207
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,530
If it's given to that hydrogen
nucleus, then this red

208
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,810
electron right here can then
be given to the carbocation

209
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,110
And then what are
we left with?

210
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,050
   

211
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:33,060
Well, we have our-- let me draw
what we started with-- so

212
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,600
we have our ring.

213
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,430
We have this double bond and
that double bond right there.

214
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,080
Now let me draw all
of our hydrogens.

215
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,180
We have this hydrogen, that
hydrogen, this one over here,

216
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,680
this one over here, and we
have this one over here.

217
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,980
Now this hydrogen just
now got nabbed.

218
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,070
So this hydrogen over here got
nabbed, it got given--

219
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,800
actually the hydrogen nucleus
got given this green electron.

220
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,760
It got given this green
electron, which is paired with

221
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,550
this magenta one right
over here.

222
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,440
   

223
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,400
So it is now bonded
to the bromine.

224
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,870
We now have hydrogen bromide.

225
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,220
And this had one, two, three,
four, five, six

226
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,390
other valence electrons.

227
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,820
I'll keep the colors
consistent.

228
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,970
And this is now bonded.

229
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,470
Now this electron went
away from the iron.

230
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,730
So the iron will now lose
its negative charge.

231
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,950
The iron bromide.

232
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,460
So now it is back in
its original form.

233
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,830
   

234
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,250
So we have our iron bonded
to three bromines.

235
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,150
We are bonded to three bromines
just like that.

236
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,730
It has lost its negative
charge.

237
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,150
And this electron right here
has now gone to the

238
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,100
carbocation So that electron
right there has now gone to

239
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,970
the carbocation.

240
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,070
It is right there.

241
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:01,950
So this bond, you can imagine it
now being this double bond.

242
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,480
So it was magenta, so I'll draw
it in magenta just there.

243
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,510
And we can't forget the whole
point of this whole video was

244
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,350
the bromination.

245
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,030
So we now have this
bromo group there.

246
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,440
So we have this orange electron
is right over here.

247
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,540
And it is bonded to
that bromine.

248
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,270
   

249
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,720
Just like that.

250
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,210
And we have brominated the
benzene ring using-- and just

251
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,840
let's be clear-- we had
a negative charge

252
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,700
and a positive charge.

253
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,660
Now it's canceled out.

254
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,940
The thing with the negative
charge gave an electron to the

255
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,870
positive charge.

256
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,140
It is now neutral.

257
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,470
That is now neutral.

258
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,740
Now let's be clear on
what happened here.

259
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,810
Just to map it to what
we saw before.

260
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,600
We had a benzene ring.

261
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,670
Right here we have no
strong electrophile,

262
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,880
or strong base yet.

263
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,920
It had to become a strong
electrophile.

264
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,950
When this thing gave an electron
to the iron bromine,

265
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,300
it became this larger
molecule.

266
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,090
Now this whole thing can
act as a pretty strong

267
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,190
electrophile.

268
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,260
This grabbed an electron.

269
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,910
It broke the aromaticity
of the benzene ring.

270
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,730
But just long enough for
this bromine to form.

271
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,980
But once this bromine, it gained
an electron and then

272
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,690
bonded to the benzene.

273
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,340
And then gave up an electron
to this other bromine that

274
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,120
really wanted to get an electron
because it had a

275
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,190
positive charge.

276
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,410
And then once it got it,
now this whole thing

277
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,730
acted as the base.

278
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,050
So we kind of have the same
molecule changing up a little

279
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,570
bit, acting as an electrophile
or acting as a base.

280
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,470
And then once it acts as a
base, this bromine, this

281
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,800
magenta bromine, nabs the
proton, allows this electron

282
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,780
to go back to that carbocation
and then we're left with the

283
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,090
iron bromide again.

284
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,210
So this thing really
didn't change

285
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,390
through the whole reaction.

286
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,940
That's why we can call it a
catalyst. It wasn't one of the

287
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,740
reagents, one of the reactants
in the reaction.

288
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,760
Hopefully you found that
vaguely interesting.
