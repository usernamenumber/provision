1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,200
We know that if we were to multiply two times three,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,270
that would give us positive six.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,380
And so we are going to think about negative numbers in this video.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,090
One way to think about it,

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,680
is that I have a positive number times another positive number,

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,280
and that gives me a positive number.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,680
So if I have a positive times a positive,

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,200
that would give me a positive number.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,280
Now it's mixed up a little bit.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,930
Introduce some negative numbers.

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:31,690
So what happens if I had negative two times three?

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,420
Negative two times three.

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,920
Well, one way to think about it--

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,840
Now we are talking about intuition in this video

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,970
and in the future videos.

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,880
You could view this as negative two repeatedly added three times.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,950
So this could be negative two plus negative two plus negative two--

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,990
Not negative six. Plus negative two.

19
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,660
which would be equal to--

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,230
well, negative two plus negative two is negative four,

21
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,560
plus another negative two is negative six.

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,110
This would be equal to negative six.

23
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,510
Or another way to think about it is,

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,900
if I had two times three, I would get six.

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,060
But because one of these two numbers is negative,

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,020
then my product is going to be negative.

27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,740
So if I multiply, a negative times a positive,

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,650
I'm going to get a negative.

29
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,740
Now what if we swap the order which we multiply?

30
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,890
So if we were to multiply three times negative two,

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,510
it shouldn't matter.

32
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,070
The order which we multiply things don't change,

33
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,510
or shouldn't change the product.

34
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,630
When we multiply two times three, we get six.

35
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,430
When we multiply three times two, we will get six.

36
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,740
So we should have the same property here.

37
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,760
Three times negative two should give us the same result.

38
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,290
It's going to be equal to negative six.

39
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,000
And once again we say, three times two would be six.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,800
One of these two numbers is negative,

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,490
and so our product is going to be negative.

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,790
So we could draw a positive times a negative

43
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,400
is also going to be a negative.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,760
And both of these are just the same thing with the order

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,080
which we are multiplying switched around.

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,100
But this is one of the two numbers are negative. Exactly one.

47
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:22,190
So one negative, one positive number is being multiplied.

48
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,320
Then you'll get a negative product.

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,080
Now we'll think about the third circumstance,

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,170
where both of the numbers are negative.

51
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,840
So if I were to multiply--I'll just switch colors for fun here--

52
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,250
If I were to multiply negative two times negative three--

53
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,750
this might be the least intuitive for you of all,

54
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,390
and here I'm going to introduce you the rule,

55
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,650
in the future I will explore why this is,

56
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,030
and why this makes mathematics more--all fit together.

57
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,200
But this is going to be, you see, two times three would be six.

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,670
And I have a negative times a negative,

59
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,960
one way you can think about it is that negatives cancel out!

60
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,820
So you'll actually end up with a positive six.

61
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,430
Actually I don't have to draw a positive here.

62
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,000
But I write it here just to reemphasize.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,490
This right over here is a positive six.

64
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,880
So we have another rule of thumb here.

65
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,270
If I have a negative times a negative,

66
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,560
the negatives are going to cancel out.

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,160
And that's going to give me a positive number.

68
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,640
Now with these out of the way, let's just do a bunch of examples.

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,260
I'm encouraging you to try them out before I do them.

70
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,230
Pause the video, try them out, and see if you get the same answer.

71
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,520
So let's try negative one times negative one.

72
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,540
Well, one times one would be one.

73
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,100
And we have a negative times a negative. They cancel out.

74
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,890
Negative times a negative give me a positive.

75
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,270
So this is going to be positive one.

76
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,230
I can just write one,

77
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,060
or I can literally write a plus sign there to emphasize.

78
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,420
This is a positive one.

79
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,370
What happened if I did negative one times zero?

80
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,620
Now this might seem, this doesn't fit into any of these circumstances,

81
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,540
zero is neither positive nor negative.

82
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,260
And here you just have to remember anything times zero

83
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,490
is going to be zero.

84
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,140
So negative one times zero is going to be zero.

85
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,650
Or I could've said zero times negative seven hundred and eighty-three,

86
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,540
that is also going to be zero.

87
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,770
Now what about two--let me do some interesting ones.

88
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,050
What about--I'm looking a new color.

89
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,850
Twelve times negative four.

90
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,920
Well, once again, twelve times positive four would be fourty-eight.

91
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,850
And we are in the circumstance where one of these two numbers,

92
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,940
right over here, is negative. This one right here.

93
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,850
If exactly one of the two numbers is negative,

94
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,680
then the product is going to be negative.

95
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,270
We are in this circumstance, right over here.

96
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,780
We have one negative, so the product is negative.

97
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,400
You could imagine this as repeatedly adding negative four twelve times

98
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,010
And so you will get to negative fourty-eight.

99
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,050
Let's do another one.

100
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,090
What is seven times three?

101
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,020
Well, this is a bit of a trick. There are no negative numbers here.

102
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,760
This is just going to be seven times three.

103
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,960
Positive seven times positive three. The first circumstance,

104
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,830
which you already knew how to do before this video.

105
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,250
This would just be equal to twenty-one.

106
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,960
Let's do one more.

107
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,030
So if I were to say negative five times negative ten--

108
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,520
well, once again, negative times a negative.

109
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,620
The negatives cancel out.

110
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,800
You are just left with a positive product.

111
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,340
So it's going to be five times ten. It's going to be fifty.

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,250
The negative and the negative cancel out.

113
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,060
Your product is going to be positive.

114
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,270
That's this situation right over there.
