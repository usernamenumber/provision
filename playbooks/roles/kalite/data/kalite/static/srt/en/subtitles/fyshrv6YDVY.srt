00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:09,400
Convert log base 4 of 2 equals 1/2 into an exponential equation

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,600
So logarithm literally tells you

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,067
so if we were to just look at this part over here.

4
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:16,467
A logarithm is just saying tell me the exponent

5
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:19,067
that I would have to raise my base to

6
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:22,733
that I would have to raise 4 to to get to 2.

7
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:26,122
So tell me the exponent that I would have to raise it to, to get to 2.

8
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:29,373
And so this equation written as a logarithmic equation

9
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:37,291
says: I need to raise 4 to the 1/2 power in order to get 2.

10
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,892
So if I wanted to write it as an exponential equation,

11
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:45,534
I could literally just say: well if I raise 4, and that's this 4 right over here, that's my base,

12
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:48,948
To this exponent, to the 1/2 power,

13
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:54,172
then that is going to be equal to 2.

14
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:58,120
And we're done. We've written the same equation as an exponential equation.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,867
The value of a logarithm, this is to think:

16
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:03,800
What do I get if I raise 4 to the 1/2 power?

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,395
I get 2 if I raise 4 to the 1/2 power.

18
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:12,333
This is saying: What power do I have to raise 4 to to get to 2?

19
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,802
And then that is equal to 1/2.

20
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:18,615
So logarithm is saying: What power do I have to raise the base to

21
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:20,411
to get what's inside the logarithm.

22
00:01:20,411 --> 99:59:59,999
This says: what do I get to when I raise 4 to the 1/2 power.
