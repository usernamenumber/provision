1
00:00:00,838 --> 00:00:05,064
Ron and Hermione are practising lifting feathers into the air with magic.

2
00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:11,426
Hermione can lift a feather 35 feet into the air which is 5 times as high Ron can lift a feather.

3
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:14,816
How high can Ron lift a feather with his magic?

4
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:18,300
So Hermione – this 35 feet is 5 times more than Ron.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,500
So to figure out what Ron can do we just take what Hermione can do and divide by 5.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,680
So what's 35 divided by 5?

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:36,900
Well, 5 times 7 is 35. So 35 divided by 5 is 7. So Ron can lift a feather 7 feet in the air.

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,610
So let's check our answer.

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,900
If you have trouble with this – 
And we can also look at the hints for this.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,567
So they show that Hermione can lift a feather 35 feet, which is 5 times higher than Ron.

11
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:51,504
So this could be the length of how high Ron can raise it.

12
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:55,540
And so, if you actually divide 35 into 5 equal sections –

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,146
So 5 × ?? is 35.

14
00:00:58,146 --> 00:01:01,999
That's the same thing as saying 35 divided by 5 is ??.

15
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:08,691
And 35 divided by 5 is indeed 7.
