1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,710
In this video, we're going to
start having some experience

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,400
solving radical equations or
equations that involve square

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,610
roots or maybe even higher-power
roots, but we're

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,680
going to also try to understand
an interesting

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,170
phenomena that occurs when
we do these equations.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,840
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,790
Let's say I have the equation
the square root of x is equal

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,900
to 2 times x minus 6.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,710
Now, one of the things you're
going to see whenever we do

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,890
these radical equations is we
want to isolate at least one

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,570
of the radicals.

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,610
There's only one of them
in this equation.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,810
And when you isolate one of the
radicals on one side of

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,700
the equation, this one starts
off like that, I have the

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,520
square root of x isolated on
the left-hand side, then we

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,480
square both sides
of the equation.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,750
So let us square both sides
of the equation.

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,930
So I'll just rewrite it again.

20
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,270
We'll do this one slowly.

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,480
I'm going to square that and
that's going to be equal to 2x

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,840
minus 6 squared.

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,930
And squaring seems like
a valid operation.

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,239
If that is equal to that, then
that squared should also be

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,400
equal to that squared.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,560
So we just keep on going.

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,550
So when you take the square root
of x and you square it,

28
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,210
that'll just be x.

29
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:19,280
And we get x is equal to-- this
squared is going to be 2x

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,340
squared, which is 4x squared.

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,560
It's 2x squared, the
whole thing.

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,030
4x squared, and then you
multiply these two, which is

33
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,890
negative 12x.

34
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,920
And then it's going to be twice
that, so minus 24x.

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,150
And then negative 6 squared
is plus 36.

36
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,240
If you found going from this to
this difficult, you might

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,750
want to review multiplying
polynomial expressions or

38
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,020
multiplying binomials, or
actually, the special case

39
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,070
where we square binomials.

40
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,580
But the general view, it's this
squared, which is that.

41
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,740
And then you have minus 2 times
the product of these 2.

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,380
The product of those two is
minus 12x or negative 12x.

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,800
2 times that is negative 24x,
and then that squared.

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,340
So this is what our equation
has I guess we could say

45
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,930
simplified to, and let's see
what happens if we subtract x

46
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,710
from both sides of
this equation.

47
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,850
So if you subtract x from both
sides of this equation, the

48
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,710
left-hand side becomes zero
and the right-hand side

49
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:21,990
becomes 4x squared minus
25x plus 36.

50
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,800
So this radical equation his
simplified to just a standard

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,670
quadratic equation.

52
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,080
And just for simplicity, not
having to worry how to factor

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,620
it and grouping and all of
that, let's just use the

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,230
quadratic formula.

55
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,475
So the quadratic formula tells
us that our solutions to this,

56
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:39,900
x can be negative b.

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,990
Negative 25.

58
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,540
The negative of negative 25 is
positive 25 plus or minus the

59
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,960
square root of 25 squared.

60
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:59,200
25 squared is 625, minus 4 times
a, which is 4, times c,

61
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:07,150
which is 36, all of that over 2
times 4, all of that over 8.

62
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,870
So let's get our calculator
out to figure out what

63
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,435
this is over here.

64
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:14,940
   

65
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,490
So let's say so we have 625
minus-- let's see., this is

66
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,470
going to be 16 times 36.

67
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,280
16 times 36 is equal to 49.

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,880
That's nice.

69
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,920
It's a nice perfect square.

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,830
We know what the square
root of 49 is.

71
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,826
It's 7.

72
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:34,780
So let me go back
to the problem.

73
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,060
So this in here simplified
to 49.

74
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,910
So x is equal to 25 plus or
minus the square root of 49,

75
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,000
which is 7, all of
that over 8.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,960
So our two solutions here, if we
add 7, we get x is equal to

77
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,870
25 plus 7 is 32, 32/8,
which is equal to 4.

78
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,940
And then our other solution,
let me do that

79
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,590
in a different color.

80
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,340
x is equal to 25 minus
7, which is 18/8.

81
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,680
8 goes into 18 two times,
remainder 2, so this is equal

82
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:20,540
to 2 and 2/8 or 2 and 1/4
or 2.25, just like that.

83
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,850
Now, I'm going to show
you an interesting

84
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,220
phenomena that occurs.

85
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,480
And maybe you might want to
pause it after I show you this

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,080
conundrum, although I'm going
to tell you why this

87
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,090
conundrum pops up.

88
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,030
Let's try out to see if our
solutions actually work.

89
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,560
So let's try x is equal to 4.

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,680
If x is equal to 4 works, we
get the principal root of 4

91
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,560
should be equal to 2
times 4 minus 6.

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,790
The principal root of
4 is positive 2.

93
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,700
Positive 2 should be equal to 2
times 4, which is 8 minus 6,

94
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,420
which it is.

95
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,670
This is true.

96
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,290
So 4 works.

97
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,420
Now, let's try to do
the same with 2.25.

98
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,380
According to this, we should
be able to take the square

99
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,593
root, the principal root of
2.2-- let me make my radical a

100
00:05:05,593 --> 00:05:06,470
little bit bigger.

101
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,840
The principal root of 2.25
should be equal to 2 times

102
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,620
2.25 minus 6.

103
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,420
Now, you may or may not be able
to do this in your head.

104
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,520
You might know that the square
root of 225 is 15.

105
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,180
And then from that, you might
be able to figure out the

106
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,180
square root of 2.25 is 1.5.

107
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,970
Let me just use the calculator
to verify that for you.

108
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,410
So 2.25, take the square root.

109
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,600
It's 1.5.

110
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,170
The principal root is 1.5.

111
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,770
Another square root
is negative 1.5.

112
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,020
So it's 1.5.

113
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,160
   

114
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,980
And then, according to this,
this should be equal to 2

115
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,990
times 2.25 is 4.5 minus 6.

116
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,970
Now, is this true?

117
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,350
This is telling us that 1.5
is equal to negative 1.5.

118
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,200
This is not true.

119
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,790
2.5 did not work for this
radical equation.

120
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,580
We call this an extraneous
solution.

121
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:13,730
So 2.25 is an extraneous
solution.

122
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,070
Now, here's the conundrum: Why
did we get 2.25 as an answer?

123
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,310
It looks like we did very valid
things the whole way

124
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,830
down, and we got a quadratic,
and we got 2.25.

125
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,260
And there's a hint here.

126
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,010
When we substitute 2.25,
we get 1.5 is

127
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,550
equal to negative 1.5.

128
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,120
So there's something here,
something we did gave us this

129
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,430
solution that doesn't quite
apply over here.

130
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,720
And I'll give you
another hint.

131
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,090
Let's try it at this step.

132
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,320
If you look at this step, you're
going to see that both

133
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,300
solutions actually work.

134
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,990
So you could try it
out if you like.

135
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,740
Actually, try it out
on your own time.

136
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,865
Put in 2.25 for x here.

137
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:51,520
You're going to see
that it works.

138
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,060
Put in 4 for x here and you see
that they both work here.

139
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,360
So they're both valid
solutions to that.

140
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,400
   

141
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,330
So something happened when we
squared that made the equation

142
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,070
a little bit different.

143
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,000
There's something slightly
different about this equation

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,550
than that equation.

145
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,710
And the answer is there's two
ways you could think about it.

146
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,430
To go back from this equation to
that equation, we take the

147
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,440
square root.

148
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,260
But to be more particular about
it, we are taking the

149
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,020
principal root of both sides.

150
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,410
Now, you could take the negative
square root as well.

151
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,710
Notice, this is only taking
the principal square root.

152
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,430
Going from this right here--
let me be very clear.

153
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,930
This statement, we already
established that both of these

154
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,610
solutions, both the valid
solution and the extraneous

155
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,350
solution to this radical
equation,

156
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,060
satisfy this right here.

157
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,970
Only the valid one satisfies
the original problem.

158
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,390
So let me write the equation
that both of them satisfy.

159
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,550
Because this is really an
interesting conundrum.

160
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,370
And I think it gives you a
little bit of a nuance and

161
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,860
kind of tells you what's
happening when we take

162
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,320
principal roots of things.

163
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,230
And why when you square both
sides, you are, to some

164
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,660
degree, you could either think
of it as losing or gaining

165
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,960
some information.

166
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,720
Now, this could be written
as x is equal

167
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,450
to 2x minus 6 squared.

168
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,090
This is one valid interpretation
of this

169
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,470
equation right here.

170
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,290
But there's a completely other
legitimate interpretation of

171
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,220
this equation.

172
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,300
This could also be x is
equal to negative 1

173
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,400
times 2x minus 6 squared.

174
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,870
And why are these equal
interpretations?

175
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,010
Because when you square the
negative 1, the negative 1

176
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,610
will disappear.

177
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,420
These are equivalent
statements.

178
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,500
And another way of writing
this one, another way of

179
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,630
writing this right here, is
that x is equal to-- you

180
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,450
multiply negative
1 times that.

181
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:58,080
You get negative 2x plus 6
or 6 minus 2x squared.

182
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,560
This and this are two ways
of writing that.

183
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,760
Now, when we took our square
root or when we-- I guess

184
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,700
there's two ways you
can think about it.

185
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,170
When we squared it, we're
assuming that this was the

186
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,800
only interpretation, but
this was the other one.

187
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,460
So we found two solutions to
this, but only 4 satisfies

188
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,060
this interpretation
right here.

189
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,800
I hope you get what I'm saying
because we're kind of only

190
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,710
taking-- you can imagine the
positive square root.

191
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,300
We're not considering the
negative square root of this,

192
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,080
because when you take the square
root of both sides to

193
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,010
get here, we're only taking
the principal root.

194
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,880
Another way to view it--
let me rewrite

195
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,130
the original equation.

196
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,560
   

197
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,630
We had the square root of x
is equal to 2x minus 6.

198
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,620
Now, we said 4 is a solution.

199
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,790
2.25 isn't a solution.

200
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,690
2.25 would've been a solution if
we said both of the square

201
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,800
roots of x is equal
to 2x minus 6.

202
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,220
Now you try it out and
2.25 will have a

203
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,330
valid solution here.

204
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,050
If you take the negative square
root of 2.25, that is

205
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,590
equal to 2 times 2.25, so that
is equal to 4.5 minus 6, which

206
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,230
is negative 1.5.

207
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,430
That is true.

208
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,200
The positive version is where
you get x is equal to 4.

209
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,250
So that's why we got
two solutions.

210
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,900
And if you square this-- maybe
this is an easier way to

211
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,300
remember it.

212
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,780
If you square this, you actually
get this equation

213
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,150
that both solutions are valid.

214
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,900
Now, you might have found
that a little bit

215
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,070
confusing and all of that.

216
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,990
My intention is not
to confuse you.

217
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,490
The simple thing to think about
when you are solving

218
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,060
radical equations is, look,
isolate radicals, square, keep

219
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,740
on solving.

220
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,460
You might get more
than one answer.

221
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,180
Plug your answers back in.

222
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,170
Answers that don't work, they're
extraneous solutions.

223
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,260
But most of my explanation in
this video is really why does

224
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,290
that extraneous solution
pop up?

225
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,900
And hopefully, I gave you some
intuition that our equation is

226
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,610
the square root of x.

227
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,140
The extraneous solution would
be valid if we took the plus

228
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,010
or minus square root of x, not
just the principal root.

229
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,133
