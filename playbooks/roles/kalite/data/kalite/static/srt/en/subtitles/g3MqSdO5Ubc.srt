1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,250
Let me graph our coordinates
in R2.

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,512
So let's see, let me do
it fairly neatly.

4
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:09,160
I want to do it neater
than that.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,990
So that is my vertical
coordinate, this is my

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,149
horizontal coordinate.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:16,640
Good enough.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,450
So let's say I have four points
in R2 specified by four

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,445
position vectors.

10
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:23,390
So this is R2 right here.

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,990
So my first position vector
is the zero vector.

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,050
So it just specifies the point
right there, so it's 0, 0.

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:40,720
My second point is specified the
by the vector say k 1, 0,

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,720
so some constant times 0.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,210
Let me write it a little
bit neater than that,

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,020
a little bit bigger.

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,960
So it's k 1, 0, so that's my
second position vector, which

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,220
would specify that point
right there.

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,010
So let me draw my vector
right there.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,190
Let's say my third point
is going to be up here.

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,672
As you can, see I'm creating
a rectangle.

22
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:06,720
Let's say it's specified
by the position vector.

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,190
Let me draw the position
vector like that.

24
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,700
And that position vector is
going to be the vector k1.

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,020
That's going to be its
horizontal component and then

26
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,480
k2 is its vertical component.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,005
If we wanted to graph it on the
coordinates, this would be

28
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:25,140
the k2 coordinate right there.

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,870
And let's say that the last
point is this point right

30
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:39,400
here, and it is specified by
the position vector 0, k2.

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,290
And let me define a set.

32
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,770
Let me call that set

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,955
rectangle, say R for rectangle.

34
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:48,310
Let me just call it Rec.

35
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,680
Let's say that rectangle is
equal to the set of all of the

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,260
points when you connect the
points specified by those

37
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,710
position vectors.

38
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:17,580
So the rectangle formed by
connecting points specified by

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,440
these guys here.

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,760
So if we call this vector a,
this is vector b, this is

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,750
vector c, and then this is
vector d right here, so

42
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,090
rectangle specified
by connecting the

43
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:38,590
points a, b, c and d.

44
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,500
Now let's say-- so let me draw
what our set rectangle is

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,000
going to be.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,500
It's going to be all of these
points here, all of these

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,960
points there, all of those
points there, and then all of

48
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,990
those points there, including
our vertices.

49
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,670
So that is my rectangle.

50
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,230
Now, what is the area within
this rectangle?

51
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,610
So this is the area
of rectangle.

52
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,750
What's the area within
this rectangle?

53
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,680
Well, it's just base
times height.

54
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,330
The base has length k1.

55
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,370
The distance from here to here
is k1, so it's just k1.

56
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,390
And what's the height?

57
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,470
It's the distance from here
to here, which is just k2.

58
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,820
So it's just k1 times k2.

59
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,310
That's fairly straightforward.

60
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,390
I haven't shown you anything
that fascinating just yet.

61
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,280
But let's say we're going
to transform this set.

62
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,540
We're going to transform this
rectangle and we're going to

63
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,870
transform it with the
transformation T.

64
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,290
Let me pick a nice
color for T.

65
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,760
Let's say we have the
transformation T.

66
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,540
It is a mapping from R2 to R2,
and it can be represented as--

67
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,100
so when you apply the
transformation T to some

68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:01,960
vector x, it is equal to the
matrix a, b, c, d times your

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,410
vector x, just like that.

70
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,440
Now, let's see what happens
when we apply the

71
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,560
transformation to each
of these points.

72
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,140
We saw many videos ago that if
you want essentially the image

73
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,880
of our rectangle under this
transformation, you can

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,860
essentially just get the
transformation of each of the

75
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,200
end points and then connect
the dots in your codomain,

76
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,610
which is also going to be R2.

77
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,820
So we just have to figure out
the transformation of each of

78
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,020
these guys.

79
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,430
So what is my transformation?

80
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,740
I'll do it over here.

81
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,670
I'll do it in the colors.

82
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,910
What is the transformation
applied to the zero vector,

83
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,270
applied to point
a right there?

84
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,860
Well, it's just going to be
a times 0 plus b times 0,

85
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,050
which is just 0.

86
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,010
And then the second term is
going to be c times 0 plus d

87
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,010
times 0, which is just 0.

88
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,530
That's vector a.

89
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,260
Vector b.

90
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,100
If I apply the transformation
to vector b, vector b is k1,

91
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,740
0, just like that.

92
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,210
If I apply the transformation,
it's going to be a times k--

93
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,610
so the first entry in the
transformed vector or what

94
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,880
we're mapping to in our codomain
is going to be a

95
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,300
times k1 plus b times
0, so it's just ak1.

96
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,980
And then the second entry's
going to be c times k1

97
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,400
plus d times 0.

98
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,390
So it's going to
be c times k1.

99
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,900
All I'm doing is taking the
matrix vector product of this

100
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,970
guy and that guy.

101
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,330
And then let's move
on to point c.

102
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:45,330
So the transformation of point
c of k1, k2 is equal to-- or

103
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,910
the transformation of
vector c, we could

104
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,760
say, is equal to what?

105
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,980
The first entry's going to be
a times k1 plus b times k2.

106
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,695
a times k1 plus b times k2, and
the second entry's going

107
00:05:57,695 --> 00:06:00,270
to be c times k1 plus
d times k2.

108
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,660
   

109
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,220
We have one point left.

110
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,310
The transformation, if we take
the transformation of our

111
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,730
vector 0, k2, what do we get?

112
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:22,620
We get a times 0 plus b times
k2, which is just b times k2,

113
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,900
and then c times 0 plus d times
k2, which is just d

114
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,780
times k2, just like that.

115
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,260
So let's draw the image of
our rectangle under our

116
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,735
transformation.

117
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:36,760
So let me redraw my axes.

118
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,120
So this is my vertical
axis right there.

119
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,330
This is my horizontal
axis right there.

120
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,250
And so a gets mapped to the
zero vector right there.

121
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:54,440
So this is the transformation
of 0, 0 right like that.

122
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,400
Now, what does the vector
b get transformed?

123
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,480
The vector b gets transformed
to ak1, ck1, so let me

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,230
draw it like this.

125
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,930
The vector b gets transformed
to something that looks like

126
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,130
this, where this is the vector--
so this is the

127
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:20,110
transformation of k1 and 0,
which is equal to ak1, ck1.

128
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,400
We saw that already.

129
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,240
Now, what does this yellow
guy get transformed to?

130
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,490
Let me do the blue one first.
So the blue one gets

131
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,390
transformed here.

132
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,090
Let me finish here.

133
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,300
So if we come down here,
this is going to

134
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,340
be ak1 right there.

135
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,090
If we go to the left like that,
that's going to ck1.

136
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,450
That's how we graph it.

137
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,980
Now this last guy, this blue
guy, maybe he looks

138
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,870
something like this.

139
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,500
   

140
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,640
This is the transformation of
that vector right there by

141
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:00,930
this linear transformation, 0,
k2, which is equal to the

142
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:10,420
vector bk2 and dk2, so this
point right here is bk2 and

143
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,320
then this coordinate
right there is dk2.

144
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,660
Now this last guy, this yellow
point, when I transformed it,

145
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,860
what do I get?

146
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,700
I get ak1, plus bk2, so ak1 plus
bk2 will get you right

147
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,620
about there, so that's going
to be its x-coordinate.

148
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,630
And then its y-coordinate
is ck1 plus dk2.

149
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,810
   

150
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,559
So ck1, and then I'm going to
add that much again to it.

151
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,250
So it's going to get me
someplace over here.

152
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,530
So I'm going to add this
distance to this whole

153
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,400
distance over here, so
I'm going to get

154
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,670
up here some point.

155
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,620
I'm going to get right
over here.

156
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,180
So that vector's going to look
something like that.

157
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,460
That is the transformation
of k1, k2.

158
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,400
That's the transformation
of that guy.

159
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,180
And then if we connect the
dots, remember, the

160
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,860
transformation of this set of
this rectangle, or we could

161
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,000
say the image of this
rectangle under the

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,890
transformation, we just take
each of the points that define

163
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,310
that rectangle and then
we connect the dots.

164
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,950
We saw that awhile ago.

165
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,000
So let me draw it this way.

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,840
This line right here that
connects those two dots will

167
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,240
be transformed to this line that
connects these two dots

168
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,950
right there.

169
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,170
This line-- I was going to do
that in a different color.

170
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,640
This line that connects those
two dots is going to be

171
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,600
transformed to this line that
connects those two dots.

172
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,990
And then we have this line that
connects those two dots

173
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,230
is going to be transformed to
this line that connects these

174
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,740
two dots right there.

175
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,610
And then finally, this line that
connects these two dots

176
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,090
is going to be transformed to
this line that connects these

177
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,800
two dots right there.

178
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,220
Now, just out of curiosity,
what is-- let

179
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,380
me just write this.

180
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,510
So this rectangle right
here is the image.

181
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,580
We could write this as T of our
rectangle, or if we wanted

182
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,220
to write it in words, this is
equal to the image of the

183
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:19,670
rectangle under our
transformation T.

184
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:27,880
Now, what is the area of the
image of our rectangle under

185
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,570
our transformation?

186
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,800
What is the area
of this thing?

187
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,670
What is this area right there?

188
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,670
Well, we could view this
parallelogram essentially as a

189
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:45,590
parallelogram generated by this
vector and that vector.

190
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,360
Or if we wanted to write it
another way, if we had a

191
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,950
matrix, if we had some matrix
whose column vectors are this

192
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,915
guy and that guy, so let's say,
it's first column vector

193
00:10:56,915 --> 00:11:03,140
is this guy, so ak1, ck1, And
this one right here, this was

194
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,780
the transformation of k1, 0.

195
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,210
And then its second column
vector is this guy right here,

196
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:18,810
which was bk2 and dk2.

197
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:24,330
This parallelogram is a
parallelogram generated by

198
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,700
these two column vectors.

199
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,610
This was the transformation
right here.

200
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,300
This was the transformation
of 0, k2, right?

201
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,670
And in the last video, we said
that the area of this

202
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,450
parallelogram is equivalent
to-- let me

203
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,650
write this right now.

204
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,220
So the area of the
parallelogram, which is the

205
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,970
same thing as the area of the
image of our original

206
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,820
rectangle under our
transformation, the area this

207
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,220
parallelogram is equivalent to
the absolute value-- let me

208
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,230
call this determinant
right here, let me

209
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,580
call this I for image.

210
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:07,420
So it's equal to the absolute
value of the determinant of

211
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,910
the matrix whose column
vectors generate that

212
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,010
parallelogram.

213
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,800
So it should be equal to the
determinant of the absolute

214
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,810
value of the determinant of I.

215
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,200
We saw that in the last video.

216
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,720
That's what the area of this
thing is going to be.

217
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,190
Well, what is the determinant
of this?

218
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,126
Well, this is going to be equal
to-- we've got to keep

219
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:30,990
our absolute value signs.

220
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,970
So the determinant of this is
ak1 times dk2, so we could

221
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,480
write this as-- let
me switch colors.

222
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,840
We could write it
as k1, k2, ad.

223
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,910
All I did is multiply that term
times that term minus

224
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,750
this term times that term.

225
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,430
So minus k1, k2, bc.

226
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,280
   

227
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,930
That's just the definition
of the

228
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,170
determinant of a 2-by-2 matrix.

229
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,470
We saw this in the last video.

230
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,050
This is nothing new here, or
maybe it might be relatively

231
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,590
new if you just watched the last
video, but all I'm saying

232
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,700
is, look, if we want to figure
out this parallelogram, this

233
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,030
is the parallelogram
generated by that

234
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,560
vector and that vector.

235
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,840
And if we say that those two
guys are the column vectors of

236
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,990
some matrix right there, we saw
on the last video that the

237
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,140
area of this parallelogram is
equal to the absolute value of

238
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,000
the determinant of
this matrix.

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,710
Now, what is the equal to?

240
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,950
This is equal to-- we can
factor out a k1, k2.

241
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:37,220
So it's the absolute value of
k1, k2 times ad minus bc.

242
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,410
Now what is this equal to?

243
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,530
Well, ad minus bc, that is
the determinant of our

244
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,590
transformation vector.

245
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,980
So if we say that T of x-- if we
called that vector-- or our

246
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,610
transformation matrix.

247
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:58,900
If we call this matrix A, if we
call it A, this is equal to

248
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:05,070
k1, k2 times the determinant
of A, which is a pretty

249
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,480
interesting takeaway.

250
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,020
What this is telling us is,
look, if I have some region,

251
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,230
or in this case, I just have the
rectangle, but if I have

252
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,360
some region in my domain and I
apply a transformation, and

253
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,390
let's say my region
has some area.

254
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,960
   

255
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,460
Let's say in this case,
it has some area A.

256
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,480
Let me write this
right as area.

257
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,290
This was my original area in
my original region, right?

258
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,760
And then I apply some
transformation to it where the

259
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,760
transformation is equal to some
matrix A times any member

260
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,020
of your domain.

261
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,710
I apply some transformation
to it.

262
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,520
I get some new region.

263
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,170
I get the image of this set
under my transformation.

264
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:57,150
Your new area is going to be
equal to the absolute value of

265
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,980
the determinant of your
transformation matrix.

266
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,800
That's the determinant of the
transformation matrix.

267
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,365
That's the transformation
matrix.

268
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:10,520
   

269
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,050
So it's equal to the
determinant of the

270
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,730
transformation matrix times
the area of your original

271
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,460
rectangle in this case, right?

272
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,990
This was your original
rectangle.

273
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,500
You take the absolute value,
just because sometimes you

274
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,540
swap these vectors you might
get a negative sign, so you

275
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,500
take the absolute value.

276
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,510
But that's a really neat idea.

277
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,630
The determinant of the
transformation matrix is

278
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,020
essentially a scaling
factor on the area

279
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,420
of a certain region.

280
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,600
Now, I'm not going to prove it
to you here, but you can kind

281
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,100
of imagine it.

282
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,620
Let's say I have some-- let
me go abstract now.

283
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,960
Let's say I have some region in
R2-- let me do a better--

284
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,600
let me do a shape that
you might recognize.

285
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,970
Let's say I have something
like that.

286
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,960
Let's say it's an
ellipse, right?

287
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,210
And this is our domain.

288
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,580
   

289
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,530
It's R2.

290
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,750
And let's say that the area
here, the area of this region

291
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,570
right here, is equal to A.

292
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,330
So area is equal to A.

293
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,180
And let's say I have some
transformation T that is a

294
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:35,800
mapping from R2 to R2 And T is
defined, so T applied to some

295
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,485
vector x in my domain is equal
to-- well, I already used A,

296
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:45,130
so let's say it's equal to some
matrix B times any vector

297
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,430
in my domain.

298
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,210
If I take the image of this area
under T, so this is my

299
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,190
domain right here.

300
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,300
Let me do it in the codomain.

301
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,850
Let's say the image of this
under B, let's say it looks

302
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,860
something like-- or my image
under T-- let's say it looks

303
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,940
something like this.

304
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,550
I don't know what it's going to
look like, but let's say it

305
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,800
looks something like this.

306
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,339
   

307
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:11,060
Let's say it looks something
like that right there, so this

308
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,490
right here.

309
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,460
So if we call this set-- let
me call it E for ellipse.

310
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,839
That's this whole thing
right here.

311
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,280
This is the ellipse
right there.

312
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,140
This is the image of my
ellipse under the

313
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,170
transformation T.

314
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,440
If I take every point of this
ellipse, I'll construct this

315
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,260
right here.

316
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,910
Or I guess maybe just to keep
the analogy straight for this

317
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,050
example, let's say that the
ellipse is the set of just the

318
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,820
boundary, but it also applies
actually if you were to fill

319
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,090
up the whole region.

320
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,450
So this is boundary gets
mapped to this

321
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,380
boundary right here.

322
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,820
But it would have worked
just as well if we

323
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,640
filled up the region.

324
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,900
Since I'm not proving either to
you very rigorously, you'll

325
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,570
have to accept it as
a leap of faith.

326
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,650
So this is the image of this
boundary under our

327
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,800
transformation.

328
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,650
And if the area surrounded by
this boundary, or if you could

329
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,570
say the area of this region is
A, then the area here, the

330
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,790
area of the image of our
ellipse under our

331
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,750
transformation is going to be
equal to the absolute value of

332
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,090
our area, our original area,
right there times the

333
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:27,565
determinant of our
transformation matrix.

334
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:31,310
   

335
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,580
If you find it a little bit of
a big leap to go from just an

336
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,310
arbitrary rectangle
transformation to maybe these

337
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,090
more generalized shapes, you
can imagine-- so T is going

338
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,230
from there to there.

339
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,300
It's always nice to
draw that arrow.

340
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,830
But if you view it as a bit of
a leap to make that jump from

341
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,530
rectangles to curves, you can
imagine this shape to be able

342
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:58,020
to be constructed by a bunch
of arbitrary rectangles.

343
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,320
So you could essentially fill
this space with a bunch of

344
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:09,120
arbitrary rectangles like
this, and you could keep

345
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,970
making them infinitely
small so that you

346
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,000
completely fill the space.

347
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,730
You completely fill that
space with rectangles.

348
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,180
And if you were to map each of
those rectangles using T, each

349
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,560
of those rectangles might look
something like this.

350
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,350
Maybe they look something
like this.

351
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,760
I don't know what they'll
look like.

352
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,970
They'll look like a bunch of
parallelograms. Maybe they'll

353
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,620
look something like that.

354
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,820
I'm not drawing it
that neatly.

355
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,140
They'll look like a bunch of
parallelograms, and they will

356
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,040
essentially fill this
space right there.

357
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,090
So that's a way you can get your
head around the idea of

358
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,200
jumping from just the arbitrary
rectangles to these

359
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,500
arbitrary curves or
shapes or regions.

360
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,310
But this is a pretty neat
outcome, and it's a very

361
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,850
interesting way to view
a determinant.

362
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,100
A determinant of a
transformation matrix is

363
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,190
essentially a scaling factor for
area as you map from one

364
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,560
region to another region, or
as we go from one region to

365
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,590
the image of that region under
the transformation.

366
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:08,933
