1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,090
Let's see if we could do a
couple more of these conic

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,420
section identification
problems.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:12,870
So I have this problem, x
squared plus y squared minus

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,990
2x plus 4y is equal to 4.

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,990
And so, the first thing I like
to do is just try to figure

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,340
out what type of conic
section this will be.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,265
And we have our -- this
is my x squared term,

8
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:29,200
my y squared term.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,440
They're on the same
side of the equation.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,590
And they both have
positive coefficients.

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,280
So this tells me that
we're going to be

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,055
dealing with an ellipse.

13
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:38,320
And in this case in particular,
the coefficients are

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,930
the same number.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,230
They're both positive 1.

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,350
So this is going to tell
me that this is a circle.

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,360
So let's get this in
the standard form.

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,350
And try to graph the circle.

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,100
So we're going to want
to complete the square.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,480
So let's take the x terms,
since we get x squared minus

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,490
2x plus something to complete
the square later on.

22
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,960
Plus, and now let's do
the y squared terms.

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:11,760
y squared plus 4y plus
something is equal to 4.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,730
And now what are we at here?

25
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,860
We take 1/2 of the
minus 2, minus 1.

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,650
Square it.

27
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,780
That becomes plus 1.

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,730
Add a 1.

29
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,260
We have nothing out here, so we
really just added a 1 to the

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,580
left-hand side of
this equation.

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,370
So we have to add 1 to
the right-hand side.

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,310
And here we take 1/2 of 4.

33
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,240
1/2 of 4 is 2.

34
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,950
2 squared is 4.

35
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,040
Put a 4 here.

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,420
So you have to add a 4 to the
right-hand side as well.

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,640
And we actually did add just a
4, because there was nothing

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,790
multiplying the 4 out here.

39
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:53,680
And so this becomes x minus 1
squared plus y plus 2 squared

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,070
is equal to 4 plus 1
plus 4 is equal to 9.

41
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,660
And there you have it.

42
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,070
We have it in the standard
form of a circle.

43
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,690
You remember that if a circle
is centered at 0, the standard

44
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,830
form would be x squared plus y
squared is equal to r squared.

45
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,860
So this is r squared, this
is the radius squared.

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,510
So that tells us the radius
of the circle is 3.

47
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,330
And it was just shifted so that
its origin, instead of being 0,

48
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,860
0, is at the point 1, minus 2.

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,440
And the reason why we got 1,
minus 2, we just have to

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,410
think about what makes this
whole expression equal 0?

51
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,960
In this case it was the origin.

52
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,120
In this case, it's x equals 1.

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,230
And what makes this whole
expression equal 0, in this

54
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,620
case, it was y is equal to 0.

55
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,950
In this case it's y
is equal to minus 2.

56
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,380
So that's our center.

57
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,700
That's our radius, and we're
ready to graph this circle.

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,610
So it's at, let me see.

59
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,340
I should graph the
circle first.

60
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,080
That's fair enough.

61
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,406
So it's going to
be at 1, minus 2.

62
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:03,280
So, 1, minus 2.

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,290
So it's going to be down here.

64
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,945
So it's going to come out, this
circle's going to start there.

65
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,290
It's going to be at 1,
and then you go 1, 2.

66
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,970
So that's pretty
close to the center.

67
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,995
Maybe I should do it at 1, 2.

68
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:28,410
So that's at center.

69
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,550
Right there, at 1, minus 2.

70
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,860
And then its radius is 3.

71
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,870
So this distance right here
is 3, in any direction.

72
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,820
3.

73
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,050
And that is 3.

74
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,940
Fair enough, that was a pretty
straightforward problem.

75
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,080
Circles in some ways
are the simplest.

76
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,430
And remember I said it's
going to be an ellipse.

77
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,870
And you say, oh, this isn't
the standard formula

78
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,820
for an ellipse.

79
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,630
So just as a refresher, if you
divide both sides of this

80
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,470
equation by 9, what do you get?

81
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:57,180
You get x minus 1 squared
over 9 plus y plus 2 squared

82
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,430
over 9 is equal to 1.

83
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,660
And then you see that the
horizontal axis, I guess.

84
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,190
Or the horizontal diameter,
is going to be 3.

85
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,810
Or the horizontal radius
is going to be 3.

86
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,260
And the vertical radius
is also going to be 3.

87
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,730
Because the radius never
changes in this ellipse.

88
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,450
Which is really a circle.

89
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,790
Let's do one more.

90
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,600
Just to make sure you
know this stuff cold.

91
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:33,660
So I have 2x squared plus y
plus 12x plus 16 is equal to 0.

92
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,080
Let's look at the x squared
and the y squared terms.

93
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,380
0's an squared term.

94
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,340
But I don't see a
y squared term.

95
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,170
So this is a bit
of a conundrum.

96
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,440
And this will lead us to the
fourth of our conic sections,

97
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,150
which I talk about in the
first video but we haven't

98
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,950
really touched on yet.

99
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,350
And that's the parabola.

100
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,280
And how do I know
it's a parabola?

101
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,210
You're familiar, and I'll go
more in future videos on all

102
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,190
the different ways that
a parabola comes about.

103
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,090
And how all the points are
equidistant between one point

104
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,330
and a line and all of that.

105
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,550
But just in very simple ways,
you recognize the most

106
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,500
simple parabola is y
is equal to x squared.

107
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,990
That parabola looks
something like this.

108
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,940
Where its minimum point, or
its vertex, is at the origin.

109
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,950
Or if you have a parabola like,
x is equal to y squared.

110
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,660
That looks something like this.

111
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,410
Where it's a sideways
version of that one.

112
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,000
Where, once again, its
vertex is at the origin.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,660
And just out of interest, so we
know that this is a parabola,

114
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,790
because we have a y and we
have an x squared, right?

115
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,610
They're different degrees.

116
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,870
There's no second
degree term of the y.

117
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,485
And just to put this in a form
that's familiar to you, let's

118
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:50,540
just subtract everything but
the y from the left-hand side.

119
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:58,760
So you get y is equal to minus
2x squared minus 12x minus 16.

120
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,890
And this is kind of the
traditional form that

121
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,660
you're familiar with.

122
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,360
You're probably even used to
finding the 0'z of this

123
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,840
parabola, and we could
do that right now.

124
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,720
We could say, OK, when
does this equation

125
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,480
intersect the x axis.

126
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,850
The x axis is when
y is equal to 0.

127
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,930
So that equals 0.

128
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,490
You get minus 2x squared
minus 12x minus 16.

129
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,820
And this is different to
what we normally do.

130
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,460
Normally I would immediately
break into completing

131
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:22,730
the square.

132
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,740
But I just want to figure out
the 0's of this parabola first.

133
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,720
So this 0's equal to minus 2
times factoring out minus 2,

134
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,110
you get x plus 6x plus 8.

135
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,470
So the 0 is equal to minus 2
times x plus 2 times x plus

136
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,420
4, I just factored that.

137
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,770
And so for this whole thing
to be 0, either this

138
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,260
is 0 or that is 0.

139
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,710
And so, either x plus
2 is equal to 0, or x

140
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,620
plus 4 is equal to 0.

141
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,180
So x is equal to minus 2,
and x is equal to minus 4.

142
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,530
That's the two 0's
of this parabola.

143
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,180
So we immediately know one
thing about this parabola, and

144
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,130
you've probably already done
this in your algebra classes.

145
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:14,350
If we were to draw the x axis,
it intersects the x axis at 1

146
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,260
and minus 2, and 3 and minus 4.

147
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,170
That's all we know
about this right now.

148
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,510
So let's see if we can use some
of our completing the square

149
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,710
skills with the conic sections
we've done so far, to to come

150
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,180
up with a little bit more
information about

151
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,220
this parabola.

152
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,850
So let's try to complete
the square with it.

153
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,920
I'll rewrite it down here.

154
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,330
So it's y is equal to, this
is the one I'm dealing with.

155
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,680
Now, let me just take the x
terms by themselves, and

156
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,430
factor out the minus 2.

157
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,970
Minus 2 times x
squared plus 6x.

158
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,240
And I'm going to add
something else.

159
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,130
And then I have a
minus 16 over there.

160
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,730
To make this a perfect square,
I have to take 1/2 of

161
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,000
this, 1/2 of the 6.

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,920
1/2 of the 6 is 3.

163
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,090
3 squared is 9.

164
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,400
If I add nine to the right-hand
side of the equation, remember,

165
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,350
I didn't just add 9.

166
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,830
This is 9 times
minus 2 I'm adding.

167
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,280
So if I subtract, that's minus
18, if I subtract 18 from the

168
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,825
right-hand side, I also have to
do it from the left-hand side.

169
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:16,720
So, subtract 18 there.

170
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,650
And now my equation becomes y
minus 18 is equal to minus

171
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,500
2 times, what is this?

172
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,740
This is x plus 3
squared minus 16.

173
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,230
And let's just get it in a form
that we might start recognizing

174
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,990
from our conic sections.

175
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,260
Let's add 16 to both sides.

176
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,070
If we add 16 to both sides,
y minus 18, plus 16.

177
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,310
It's going to be y minus
2, I'll put parentheses

178
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:45,810
around that.

179
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,470
Is equal to minus 2
times x plus 3 squared.

180
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,860
And you might wonder why
I put it in this form.

181
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,850
And I did because this'll help
us, this is kind of the same

182
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,830
pattern that you see with all
of the other conic sections.

183
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,180
Like, if I were to tell you to
graph y is equal to x squared,

184
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,110
y is equal to x squared.

185
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,630
It would look something like,
let me draw the uh-whoops.

186
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,790
Draw some axes here.

187
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,170
y equals x squared looks
something like this.

188
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,370
It looks like a parabola.

189
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,540
I mean, it is a parabola,
with the vertex at 0,

190
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,630
or its minimum point.

191
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,800
And that's what the vertex is,
is the minimum point of, or the

192
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,310
maximum point of the parabola.

193
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,020
We'll talk more about that,
you'll learn a lot more about

194
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,570
that when we go into calculus.

195
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,090
But I think you can recognize
it, the bottom of the

196
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,860
U or the top of the U.

197
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,540
If I were to draw y is equal
to minus x squared, you

198
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,490
could plot some points.

199
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,160
But it looks
something like that.

200
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,120
If I were to try to graph y is
equal to 2x squared, it would

201
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,220
just be like the y is equal to
x squared, but it would

202
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,370
go up twice as fast.

203
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,010
It would look
something like that.

204
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,330
So the vertex at the origin.

205
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,480
And finally, if I were to
graph y is equal to minus

206
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,150
2x squared, it would look
something like this.

207
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,120
It would open downward and it
would go down twice as fast.

208
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,590
Now, this one, this equation
that we ended up with, right

209
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,640
here, this is the same thing as
y is equal to minus 2x squared.

210
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,200
It has the same general shape.

211
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,130
But instead of its vertex, or
its center or its starting

212
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,780
point, or whatever you want
to call it, to be at the

213
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,810
origin, it's shifted now.

214
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,675
You say what y value makes
this term zero, well,

215
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:31,470
y is equal to 2.

216
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,890
Just why, in this case,
what y value makes this 0?

217
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, it's 0 here because
we were at the origin.

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,690
And here, what x
value makes this 0?

219
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,920
It's x is equal to minus 3.

220
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,800
So this gives us information
about where the vertex is.

221
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,620
It's at x is equal to
minus 3, y is equal to 2.

222
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,190
So it's at x is equal to 1,
2, 3. y is equal to 1, 2.

223
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,080
Right there.

224
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,650
We already know those two
points, because we've

225
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,480
figure out it's 0.

226
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,810
But even if we didn't know
those two points -- we know

227
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,920
that this has the same
general shape as y is

228
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,770
equal to minus 2x squared.

229
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,620
So it's going to open downward.

230
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,330
Like this.

231
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,660
And a little bit faster than y
is equal to minus x squared.

232
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,020
So it's going to
look like this.

233
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,150
And we know it goes through
that point and we know it

234
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,590
goes through that point.

235
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,730
There you go.

236
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,970
So we've touched on
every conic section.

237
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,720
And in the next two videos,
I'll go into a little bit more

238
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,830
depth of the theory behind
conic sections and how they

239
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,140
came about and all of that.

240
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,990
But I think now you're ready
to tackle a lot of what you

241
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,500
might actually see on
your algebra test.

242
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,002
See you soon.
