1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,810
We need to evaluate the limit,
as x approaches infinity, of 4x

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:18,350
squared minus 5x, all of that
over 1 minus 3x squared.

3
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,120
So infinity is kind
of a strange number.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,940
You can't just plug in infinity
and see what happens.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,450
But if you wanted to evaluate
this limit, what you might try

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,420
to do is just evaluate-- if you
want to find the limit as this

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,020
numerator approaches infinity,
you put in really large numbers

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,840
there, and you're going to see
that it approaches infinity.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,980
That the numerator
approaches infinity as

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,200
x approaches infinity.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,300
And if you put really large
numbers in the denominator,

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,600
you're going to see
that that also-- well,

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,780
not quite infinity.

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,230
3x squared will approach
infinity, but we're

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,190
subtracting it.

16
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,100
   

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,280
If you subtract infinity from
some non-infinite number, it's

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,220
going to be negative infinity.

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,610
So if you were to just kind
of evaluate it at infinity,

20
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,260
the numerator, you would
get positive infinity.

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,915
The denominator, you would
get negative infinity.

22
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:06,260
So I'll write it like this.

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,420
Negative infinity.

24
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,800
And that's one of the
indeterminate forms

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,770
that L'Hopital's Rule
can be applied to.

26
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,040
And you're probably saying,
hey, Sal, why are we even

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,400
using L'Hopital's Rule?

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,450
I know how to do this
without L'Hopital's Rule.

29
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,130
And you probably
do, or you should.

30
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,160
And we'll do that in a second.

31
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,220
But I just wanted to show you
that L'Hopital's Rule also

32
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,150
works for this type of problem,
and I really just wanted to

33
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,190
show you an example that had a
infinity over negative

34
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,510
or positive infinity
indeterminate form.

35
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,320
But let's apply
L'Hopital's Rule here.

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,360
So if this limit exists, or if
the limit of their derivatives

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,380
exist, then this limit's going
to be equal to the limit as x

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,000
approaches infinity of the
derivative of the numerator.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,750
So the derivative of the
numerator is-- the derivative

40
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:56,130
of 4x squared is 8x minus 5
over-- the derivative of the

41
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,420
denominator is, well,
derivative of 1 is 0.

42
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,200
Derivative of negative 3x
squared is negative 6x.

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,200
And once again, when you
evaluated infinity, the

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,930
numerator is going to
approach infinity.

45
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,310
And the denominator is
approaching negative infinity.

46
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,240
Negative 6 times infinity
is negative infinity.

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,390
So this is negative infinity.

48
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,240
So let's apply
L'Hopital's Rule again.

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,250
So if the limit of these guys'
derivatives exist-- or the

50
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,620
rational function of the
derivative of this guy divided

51
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,870
by the derivative of that guy--
if that exists, then this

52
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,010
limit's going to be equal to
the limit as x approaches

53
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:38,280
infinity of-- arbitrarily
switch colors-- derivative

54
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,570
of 8x minus 5 is just 8.

55
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,710
Derivative of negative
6x is negative 6.

56
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,040
And this is just going to be--
this is just a constant here.

57
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,910
So it doesn't matter what limit
you're approaching, this is

58
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,200
just going to equal this value.

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,670
Which is what?

60
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,540
If we put it in lowest
common form, or simplified

61
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,670
form, it's negative 4/3.

62
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,810
   

63
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,440
So this limit exists.

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,920
This was an indeterminate form.

65
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,060
And the limit of this
function's derivative over this

66
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,680
function's derivative exists,
so this limit must also

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,190
equal negative 4/3.

68
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,610
And by that same argument,
that limit also must be

69
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,520
equal to negative 4/3.

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,950
And for those of you who
say, hey, we already

71
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,540
knew how to do this.

72
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,470
We could just factor
out an x squared.

73
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,400
You are absolutely right.

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,440
And I'll show you
that right here.

75
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,580
Just to show you that it's
not the only-- you know,

76
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,920
L'Hopital's Rule is not
the only game in town.

77
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,630
And frankly, for this type of
problem, my first reaction

78
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,380
probably wouldn't have been to
use L'Hopital's Rule first.

79
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,360
You could have said that that
first limit-- so the limit as x

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,630
approaches infinity of 4x
squared minus 5x over 1 minus

81
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,830
3x squared is equal to the
limit as x approaches infinity.

82
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,940
Let me draw a little line here,
to show you that this is equal

83
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,010
to that, not to this
thing over here.

84
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,790
This is equal to the limit
as x approaches infinity.

85
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,020
Let's factor out an x squared
out of the numerator

86
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,690
and the denominator.

87
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:15,750
So you have an x squared
times 4 minus 5 over x.

88
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,220
Right? x squared times 5
over x is going to be 5x.

89
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,440
Divided by-- let's factor out
an x out of the numerator.

90
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:29,750
So x squared times 1
over x squared minus 3.

91
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,540
And then these x
squareds cancel out.

92
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,920
So this is going to be equal
to the limit as x approaches

93
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:45,990
infinity of 4 minus 5 over x
over 1 over x squared minus 3.

94
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,760
And what's this going
to be equal to?

95
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,610
Well, as x approaches
infinity-- 5 divided by

96
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,050
infinity-- this term
is going to be 0.

97
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,160
Super duper infinitely
large denominator,

98
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,650
this is going to be 0.

99
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,800
That is going to approach 0.

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,900
And same argument.

101
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,400
This right here is
going to approach 0.

102
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,010
All you're left with is
a 4 and a negative 3.

103
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,570
   

104
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,130
So this is going to be
equal to negative, or 4 over a

105
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,610
negative 3, or negative 4/3.

106
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,270
So you didn't have to do
use L'Hopital's Rule

107
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,910
for this problem.
