1
00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:03,628
We left off in the last video in the Archean eon,

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:07,091
where Arche comes from ancient Greek, meaning beginning or origin,

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:11,765
and it's the eon in which either life first starts to exist,

4
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:13,929
or at least it's first starts to somewhat flourish,

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:17,034
it's possible that maybe life starts to exist

6
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,813
at the end of the Hadean eon

7
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:21,169
and of course, this boundary is big.

8
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,239
The Archeon is also the first eon

9
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,523
where we still have rocks from that time.

10
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:29,851
So we are able to find rocks that we can date to be roughly

11
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,574
3,8 biliion years. The other really interesting thing

12
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:37,365
that happened in the Archeon eon that really has a profound

13
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:40,521
effects once we get to the Proteozoic eon

14
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:44,395
is that you start to have cyanobacteria

15
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:47,503
to produce oxygen. We've seen in the last video

16
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:50,707
that they were producing oxygen but most of that oxygen

17
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:53,346
was being absorbed by iron in the oceans.

18
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:57,359
But what happens as we enter into the Proteozoic eon,

19
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,836
Proteozoic eon, it's right over here as you can see

20
00:01:01,836 --> 00:01:05,676
we write it Pro-teo-zoic,

21
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:08,904
we are now in the Proteozoic eon.

22
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:15,655
That starts up about 2,5 billion years ago

23
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,842
and Proteotoic comes from the Greek

24
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:22,714
for earlier life.

25
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:25,183
I'm not a Greek scholar, so you know,

26
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:29,108
forgive me if I'm not getting the translation exactly right.

27
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:33,039
But what's really interesting about the Proteozoic eon

28
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,163
is that that oxygen that was being produced by that cyanobacteria

29
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,901
at some point begins to saturate the iron

30
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,917
and any other molecule that could have absorbed before.

31
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:48,706
And once it is saturated, it starts to get released into the atmosphere.

32
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:51,577
So the oxygen starts to get released

33
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:54,664
and accumulated in the atmosphere. We think this happened

34
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:58,430
to start to happend about 2,4 biliion years ago.

35
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,945
So 2,4 biliion years ago

36
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:05,402
oxygen begins to accumulate in the atmosphere. And of course, you know

37
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:08,264
these days they may have been moved around a few hundred milion years

38
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:11,492
as it gets more and more detailed. But this is the current understanding

39
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:15,514
of when things happened. Maybe we will look at the geological records

40
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,875
and fossil records that will move things around in the future.

41
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,242
I can only imagine that 50 years from now or 100 years from now

42
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,906
somenes still watching this video and lot of these might say

43
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:27,455
hey, now we have found later that oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere

44
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:30,491
earlier or later or that Eucaryotes occured earlier or later,

45
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:33,991
but this, as far as I can tell, is our best current understanding.

46
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:42,101
2,4 biliion years ago oxygen begins to accumulate

47
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:47,088
in the atmosphere. And what is interesting

48
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:50,171
about this is once it accumulates, once it has come

49
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:53,642
critical amount of oxygen in the atmosphere,

50
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:57,623
and I touched on this in the last video, about 2,3 biliion years ago

51
00:02:57,623 --> 00:03:01,498
we have something called the great oxygenation event.

52
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:06,527
Sometimens called the oxygen catastrophy. And this is right here,

53
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:09,467
2,3 billion years ago or 23 hundred milion years ago

54
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:14,106
the atmosphere becomes oxygen-rich.

55
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:16,617
Not as rich as our current atmosphere,

56
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:21,656
But it becomes oxygen-rich enough that at least the environment

57
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:25,660
becomes suitable for eucaryotic organisms

58
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,627
or eucaryotic cell. Now, the other interesting thing that we might not care

59
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:33,038
so much about it because we needed the oxygen, is that we think that

60
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:36,614
this was actually the greatest extinction event in the history of Earth.

61
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:40,037
That's what is called the oxygen catastrophy.

62
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:43,827
So right over here, 2,3 billion years ago, a shouldn't giggle about this,

63
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:46,773
this is a serious matter, this it the greatest,

64
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:50,184
the greatest extinction event

65
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:55,702
in Earth's history!

66
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,770
In History. And I'll do history with capital H.

67
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,527
In the history of the Earth. And that's because of

68
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:07,199
the cyanobacteria producing lots of oxygen, eventually saturates the iron

69
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,574
it accumulates in the air, once it gets to enough concentration

70
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:12,909
it begins to actually suffocate. It's poisonous

71
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:16,998
to most of the other organisms on the planet

72
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:20,169
that were anaerobic, that they did not need oxygen,

73
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:24,001
they actually found oxygen poisonous.

74
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:28,780
Now, but since we have oxygen there's two interesting things that happened

75
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,303
once that oxygen accumulated did other than causing this

76
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:34,424
that mass extinction. There are actually three interesting things. Two of them

77
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:38,741
are essentially crucial to us eventually showing up

78
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:41,296
on this planet. The first is that it becames

79
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:45,328
suitable now for Eucaryotes to exists.

80
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:49,250
Eucaryotic organisms. Remember, these are organisms that have

81
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,373
the nuclear membranes around their DNA, most Eucaryotes have other

82
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:57,590
organelles like mitochontria. They need oxygen.

83
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,920
They need oxygen.

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,752
You can go to the biology play there we actually talk about respiration

85
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,922
that occures in the mitochondria and that is obviously

86
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:12,255
a process that needs oxygen. So when we have

87
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:15,314
oxygen in the atmosphere we're starting to have

88
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,129
an environment where Eucaryotes could at least exist

89
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,580
and based on the fossil records on what we looked the DNA has changed

90
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,675
over time, I'll do more videos on that, we think that

91
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:28,383
the first Eucaryotes showed up about

92
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:31,743
2,2 billion years ago, althought there is some debate here,

93
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:35,006
there is some evidence that it might have been a little earlier, a little later,

94
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:38,665
I'm sure that number will be refind. But, you know,

95
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:41,583
give a take of few hundred million of years,

96
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:45,823
one procaryot got engulfed by another procaryot

97
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:47,770
and say 'hey, we do pretty well living together'

98
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,526
lot of the current theories that mitochondria has actually descended

99
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:56,619
the current theory is that mitochondria actually descended from

100
00:05:56,619 --> 00:06:00,323
kind of an ancient procaryotic cell, an ancient bactery actually has

101
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:04,042
its own DNA. Actually your mitochondrial DNA

102
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:06,420
is passed down from your mother and your mother's mother

103
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,408
and your grandmother's mother and so on. It's kind of another

104
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:12,605
little animal living inside of a larger cell.

105
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,910
And we are Eucaryotes. We needed this to happen.

106
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,483
The human body is not one eucaryotic cell. We're made up of trillions.

107
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:24,409
It is estimated to 50 to 100 trillion eucaryotic cells.

108
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:28,182
So these are our ancestors that had to

109
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:31,076
come into being at that time. Once again, all of this

110
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:34,375
is happening inside of the oceans.

111
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:38,703
The other interesting thing that happened. Remember, we were being bombarded

112
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:41,744
with UV radiation from the sun. So if you are on the land,

113
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:46,591
let me draw the land and the ocean.

114
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:51,171
So here is the ocean and here is the land.

115
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:54,791
Here is the land righ over there in yellow.

116
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,739
Constantly being bombarded with UV radiation.

117
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:02,853
UV stand for ultraviolet. It is even more violet than purple.

118
00:07:02,853 --> 00:07:07,206
So it is constantly being bombarded with ultraviolet radiation

119
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:11,153
from the sun which is very inhospitable to DNA

120
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:14,980
and to life. So the only life at this point could occure

121
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,748
in the ocean where was protected to some degree from the UV,

122
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:22,603
the land was just open to it.

123
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,855
Anything on the land was just irradiated.

124
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:28,840
The DNA would get mutated, just would not be able to live.

125
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,242
So what I guess had to happen, and the reason why

126
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:35,348
are we are able to live on the land, is that we have an ozone layer.

127
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:40,862
We have an ozone layer up in the upper atmosphere

128
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:43,834
that helps absorb, that blocks

129
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:47,321
most of the UV radiation from the sun.

130
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:51,740
And now the oxygen began to accumulate. We had the oxygen catastrophy,

131
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,975
oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere, some of that oxygen

132
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:59,571
goes into the the upper atmosphere. So we are now in this time period.

133
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:03,910
It goes into the upper atmosphere, it actually reacts with the UV light

134
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,106
to turn into ozone which then can help

135
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:09,945
actually block the UV ligt. I'll do another video

136
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:14,670
on the ozone-oxygen cycle. So this oxygen production

137
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,873
is crucial one to have an ozone layer,

138
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:21,303
so that eventually life can exist on the land,

139
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:25,702
it is also crucial because eucaryotic organisms need that oxygen.

140
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:29,005
Now the third thing that happened and also being a significant event,

141
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:34,512
we believe that that oxygen that started to accumulate in the atmosphere

142
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:38,412
reacted with methane in the atmosphere,

143
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:46,238
and methane is a greenhouse gas. It helps retain heat

144
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:49,712
in the atmosphere. And once it reacts with the oxygen

145
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:53,169
and starts dropping out of the atmosphere as methane, we believe

146
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:56,080
the Earth cooled down and it entered its first

147
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,605
and some people believe its longest snowball period.

148
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:03,332
So that's what they talk about here in this diagram.

149
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:08,855
The first snowball Earth. It's sometimes called the Huronic glaciation.

150
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:11,434
That happened because we were unable to retain the heat

151
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:14,660
if that theory is correct. So as the theory goes,

152
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,842
the whole Earth essentially just iced over.

153
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:24,102
So as we go through the Proteozoic eon,

154
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:28,309
I guess the big markers of that, this is the first time

155
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,923
that we have an oxygen-rich atmosphere.

156
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:35,169
The first time that Eucaryotes can come to existence

157

158
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:43,433
The other big thing is that this is where the ozone forms.

159
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:46,769
It kind of sets the stage for the next eon.

160
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:50,704
For animals or for living things to eventually

161
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:54,767
get on to the land. I will talk about that in the next video.
