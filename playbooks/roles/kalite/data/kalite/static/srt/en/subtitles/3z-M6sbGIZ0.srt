1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,540
Let's say you're some type of
traffic engineer and what

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,810
you're trying to figure out is,
how many cars pass by a certain

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,320
point on the street at
any given point in time?

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,210
And you want to figure out
the probabilities that a

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,010
hundred cars pass or 5
cars pass in a given hour.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,810
So a good place to start is
just to define a random

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,530
variable that essentially
represents what you care about.

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:27,350
So let's say the number of cars
that pass in some amount of

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,407
time, let's say, in an hour.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,510
And your goal is to figure out
the probability distribution of

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,050
this random variable and then
once you know the probability

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,450
distribution then you can
figure out what's the

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,790
probability that 100 cars pass
in an hour or the probability

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,890
that no cars pass in an hour
and you'd be unstoppable.

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,290
And just a little aside, just
to move forward with this

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,540
video, there's two assumptions
we need to make because

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,235
we're going to study the
Poisson distribution.

18
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:54,110
And in order to study it's
there's two assumptions

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,630
we have to make:

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,770
That any hour at this point
on the street is no different

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,650
than any other hour.

22
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,340
And we know that that's
probably false.

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,750
During rush hour in a real
situation you probably

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,640
would have more cars than
at another rush hour.

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
And you know, if you wanted to
be more realistic maybe we do

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,370
it in the day because in a day
any period of time--

27
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:12,750
actually, no.

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,120
I shouldn't do a day.

29
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,750
We have to assume that every
hour is completely just like

30
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,650
any other hour and actually,
even within the hour there's

31
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,990
really no differentiation from
one second to the other in

32
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,820
terms of the probabilities
that a car arrives.

33
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,950
That's a little bit of a
simplifying assumption that

34
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,950
might not truly apply to
traffic, but I think we

35
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,270
can make that assumption.

36
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,160
And then the other assumption
we need to make is that if a

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,690
bunch of cars pass in one hour
that doesn't mean that fewer

38
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,820
cars will pass in the next.

39
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,630
That in no way does the number
of cars that pass in one period

40
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,860
affect or correlate or somehow
influence the number of cars

41
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,380
that pass in the next.

42
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,370
That they're really
independent.

43
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,670
Given that, we can then at
least try using the skills

44
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,480
we have to model out some
type of a distribution.

45
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,770
The first thing you do and I'd
recommend doing this for any

46
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,090
distribution is maybe we
can estimate the mean.

47
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,040
Let's sit out on that curb and
measure what this variable is

48
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,170
over a bunch of hours and then
average it up, and that's going

49
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,890
to be a pretty good estimator
for the actual mean

50
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,880
of our population.

51
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,270
Or, since it's a random
variable, the expected value

52
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,010
of this random variable.

53
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,660
Let's say you do that and you
get your best estimate of the

54
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:22,270
expected value of this random
variable is-- I'll use

55
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,850
the letter lambda.

56
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,380
You know, this could
be 9 cars per hour.

57
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,190
You sat out there-- it could
be 9.3 cars per hour.

58
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,670
You sat out there over hundreds
of hours and you just counted

59
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,590
the number of cars each hour
and you averaged them all up.

60
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,250
You said, on average, there are
9.3 cars per hour and you feel

61
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,680
that's a pretty good estimate.

62
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,080
So that's what you have there.

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,000
And let's see what we could do.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,560
We know the binomial
distribution.

65
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,650
The binomial distribution tells
us that the expected value of a

66
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,220
random variable is equal to the
number of trials that that

67
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,460
random variable's kind
of composed of, right?

68
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,490
Before, in the previous videos
we were counting the number

69
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,500
of heads in a coin toss.

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,070
So this would be the number
of coin tosses, times the

71
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,290
probability of success
over each toss.

72
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,000
This is what we did with
the binomial distribution.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,670
So maybe we can model
our traffic situation

74
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,780
something similar.

75
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,400
This is the number of cars
that pass in an hour.

76
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,800
So maybe we could say lambda
cars per hour is equal

77
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,330
to-- I don't know.

78
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,880
Let's make each experiment or
each toss of the coin equal to

79
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,780
whether a car passes
in a given minute.

80
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,980
So there are 60 minutes
per hour, so there

81
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,870
would be 60 trials.

82
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,190
And then, the probability that
we have success in each of

83
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,990
those trials, if we modeled
this as a binomial distribution

84
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:54,450
would be lambda over
60 cars per minute.

85
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,660
And this would be
a probability.

86
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,640
This would be n, and this would
be the probability, if we said

87
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,270
that this is a binomial
distribution.

88
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,030
And this probably wouldn't be
that bad of an approximation.

89
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,130
If you actually then said,
oh, this is a binomial

90
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,380
distribution, so the
probability that our random

91
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,940
variable equals some
given value, k.

92
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,170
You know, the probability that
3 cars, exactly 3 cars pass in

93
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,750
an given hour, we would
then be equal to n.

94
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,890
So n would be 60.

95
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,010
Choose k, and you know,
I have 3 cars times the

96
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,190
probability of success.

97
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,570
So the probability that a
car passes in any minute.

98
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,770
So it'd be lambda over
60 to the number of

99
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,980
successes we need.

100
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,660
So to the kth power, times the
probability of no success or

101
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,560
that no cars pass,
to the n minus k.

102
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,230
If we have k successes we have
to have 60 minus k failures.

103
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,950
There are 60 minus k minutes
where no car passed.

104
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,270
This actually wouldn't be that
bad of an approximation where

105
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,250
you have 60 intervals and you
say this is a binomial

106
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,560
distribution.

107
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,310
And you'd probably get
reasonable results.

108
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,600
But there's a core issue here.

109
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,580
In this model where we model it
as a binomial distribution,

110
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,980
what happens if more than
one car passes in an hour?

111
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,630
Or more than one car
passes in a minute?

112
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,270
The way we have it right now
we call it a success if one

113
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,320
car passes in a minute.

114
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,790
And if you're kind of counting
it counts as one success, even

115
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,190
if 5 cars pass in that minute.

116
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,390
So you say, oh, OK Sal, I
know the solution there.

117
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,040
I just have to get
more granular.

118
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,870
Instead of dividing it
into minutes why don't I

119
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,050
divide it into seconds?

120
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,210
So the probability that I have
k successes-- instead of 60

121
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,820
intervals I'll do
3,600 intervals.

122
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,170
So the probability of k
successful seconds, so a second

123
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,610
where a car is passing at that
moment out of 3,600 seconds.

124
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,190
So that's 3,600 choose k, times
the probability that a car

125
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,210
passes in any given second.

126
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,930
That's the expected number of
cars in an hour divided by

127
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,430
number seconds in an hour.

128
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,403
We're going to
have k successes.

129
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,270
And these are the failures,
the probability of a failure

130
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:12,050
and you're going to have
3,600 minus k failures.

131
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,910
And this would be even a
better approximation.

132
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,770
This actually would not be so
bad, but still, you have this

133
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,100
situation where 2 cars
can come within a half a

134
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,980
second of each other.

135
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,910
And you say, oh, OK Sal,
I see the pattern here.

136
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,650
We just have to get more
and more granular.

137
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,170
We have to just make
this number larger and

138
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,400
larger and larger.

139
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,950
And your intuition is correct.

140
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,340
And if you do that you'll
end up getting the

141
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,860
Poisson distribution.

142
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,620
And this is really interesting
because a lot of times people

143
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,600
give you the formula for the
Poisson distribution and you

144
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,420
can kind of just plug in
the numbers and use it.

145
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,250
But it's neat to know that it
really is just the binomial

146
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,790
distribution and the binomial
distribution really did come

147
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,590
from kind of the common
sense of flipping coins.

148
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,500
That's where everything
is coming from.

149
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,710
But before we kind of prove
that if we take the limit

150
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,670
as-- let me change colors.

151
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,470
Before we proved that as we
take the limit as this number

152
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,270
right here, the number of
intervals approaches infinity

153
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,070
that this becomes the
Poisson distribution.

154
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,290
I'm going to make sure we have
a couple of mathematical

155
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,150
tools in our belt.

156
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,760
So the first is something that
you're probably reasonably

157
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,860
familiar with by now, but I
just want to make sure that the

158
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:25,680
limit as x approaches infinity
of 1 plus a/x to the x power is

159
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,020
equal to e to the
ax-- no sorry.

160
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Is equal to e to the a and now
just to prove this to you,

161
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,260
let's make a little
substitution here.

162
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,640
Let's say that n is equal
to-- let me say 1 over

163
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,880
n is equal to a over x.

164
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,890
And then what would be
x would equal to na.

165
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,290
x times 1 is equal
to n times a.

166
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,050
And so the limit as x
approaches infinity,

167
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,045
what does a approach?

168
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:02,885
a is-- sorry.

169
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:04,920
As x approaches infinity
what does n approach?

170
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,350
Well n is x divided by a.

171
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,710
So n would also
approach infinity.

172
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,810
So this thing would be the same
thing as just making our

173
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:16,460
substitution the limit as n
approaches infinity of 1

174
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,390
plus-- a/x, I made the
substitution as 1/n.

175
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:26,720
And x is, by this
substitution, n times a.

176
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,500
And this is going to be the
same thing as the limit as n

177
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,090
approaches infinity of 1 plus
1/n to the n, all

178
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,390
of that to the a.

179
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,760
And since there's no n out here
we could just take the limit

180
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,450
of this and then take
that to the a power.

181
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,690
So that's going to be equal to
the limit as n approaches

182
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,600
infinity of 1 plus 1/n to the
nth power, all of

183
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,780
that to the a.

184
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,040
And this is our definition, or
one of the ways to get to e if

185
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,820
you'd watch the videos on
compound interest and all that.

186
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,880
This is how we got to e.

187
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,460
And if you tried it out on your
calculator, just try larger

188
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,260
and larger n's here
and you'll get e.

189
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,010
This inner part is equal to e,
and we raised it to the a

190
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,060
power, so it's equal
to e to the a.

191
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,240
So hopefully you pretty
satisfied that this limit

192
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,860
is equal to e to the a.

193
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,860
And then one other tool kit I
want in our belt, and I'll

194
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,340
probably actually do the
proof in the next video.

195
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:32,950
The other tool kit is to
recognize that x factorial over

196
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:42,860
x minus k factorial is equal to
x times x minus 1 times x

197
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:50,030
minus 2, all the way down
to times x minus k plus 1.

198
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,880
And we've done this a lot of
times, but this is the most

199
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,060
abstract we've ever written it.

200
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,580
I can give you a couple of--
and just so you know, they'll

201
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,330
be exactly k terms here.

202
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,700
1, 2, 3-- So first term, second
term, third term, all the

203
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,310
way, and this the kth term.

204
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,210
And this is important to
our derivation of the

205
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,160
Poisson distribution.

206
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,870
But just to make this in real
numbers, if I had 7 factorial

207
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:20,110
over 7 minus 2 factorial,
that's equal to 7 times 6

208
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,070
times 5 times 4 times
3 times 3 times 1.

209
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,360
Over 2 times-- no sorry.

210
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,940
7 minus 2, this is 5.

211
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,500
So it's over 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1.

212
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,190
These cancel out and you
just have 7 times 6.

213
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,990
And so it's 7 and then
the last term is 7 minus

214
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,045
2 plus 1, which is 6.

215
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,290
In this example, k was 2 and
you had exactly 2 terms.

216
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,230
So once we know those two
things we're now ready

217
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,710
to derive the Poisson
distribution and I'll do

218
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,415
that in the next video.

219
00:10:58,415 --> 00:10:59,980
See you soon.
