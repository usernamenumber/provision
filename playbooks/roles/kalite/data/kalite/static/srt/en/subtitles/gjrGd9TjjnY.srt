1
00:00:01,103 --> 00:00:03,791
Simplify: negative one times this expression in brackets

2
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:07,393
negative seven plus 2 times 3 plus 2

3
00:00:07,393 --> 00:00:11,113
minus 5 in parentheses, squared.

4
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:14,003
So this is an order of operations problem,

5
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:16,458
and remember in order of operations,

6
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,526
you always wanna do parentheses first.

7
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:20,209
Parentheses.

8
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:22,361
Parentheses..first.

9
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:25,573
Then you do exponents. Exponents.

10
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:29,090
And there are--there is an exponent in this problem, right over here.

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,237
Then you wanna do multiplication...

12
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:33,536
multiplication and division,

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:37,570
and then finally you do addition and subtraction.

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,200
So let's just try to tackle this as best we can.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,838
So first let's do the parentheses. Let's do the parentheses...

16
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,515
We have a 3+2 here in parentheses,

17
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:51,215
so we can evaluate that to be equal to 5.

18
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:55,037
And let's see we can do other things in other parts of this expression

19
00:00:55,037 --> 00:00:57,951
that won't affect what's going on right here in the parentheses.

20
00:00:57,951 --> 00:01:01,185
We have this negative 5 squared,

21
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:03,917
or actually I should say we have some subtracting of 5 squared.

22
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:07,685
We wanna do the exponent before we worry about being subtracted,

23
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:12,770
so this 5 squared over here, we can rewrite as 25.

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,614
Let's not do too many steps at once,

25
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:18,433
so this whole thing would simplify to negative 1,

26
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:24,183
and then in brackets we have negative 7 plus 2 times 5,

27
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:29,471
plus 2 times 5, and then 2 times 5,

28
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:32,432
and close brackets, minus 25.

29
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:34,896
Minus 25.

30
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:38,831
Now, this thing we wanna do multiplication.

31
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:39,753
You could say,

32
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:41,988
"hey, we have the parentheses, why don't we do them first"

33
00:01:41,988 --> 00:01:44,068
but when we just evaluate what's inside these parentheses

34
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:45,417
you just get a negative 7,

35
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:46,736
it doesn't really change anything.

36
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:48,905
So we can just leave this as negative 7.

37
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:52,086
And this expression, we do want to evaluate this whole expression

38
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:53,667
before we anything else.

39
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,986
I mean we could distribute this negative 1 and all that,

40
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:58,789
but let's just do straight up order of operations here.

41
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,623
So let's evaluate this expression.

42
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:03,435
We want to do multiplication before we add anything.

43
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:06,271
So we get a 2 times 5 right over there,

44
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:10,143
2 times 5 is 10. That is 10.

45
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:11,947
So our whole expression becomes...

46
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:14,285
Normally you don't have to rewrite the expression this many times,

47
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:15,715
but what we're gonna do at this time

48
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,563
to make sure no one gets confused.

49
00:02:17,563 --> 00:02:23,315
So is becomes negative 1 times negative 7 plus 10,

50
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:31,813
plus 10, we close our brackets, minus 25. Minus 25.

51
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:34,367
Now we can evaluate this pretty easily.

52
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:39,380
Negative 7 plus 10. You can view as starting with negative 7,

53
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,981
so I was gonna draw a number line there.

54
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:45,614
So we're starting - draw a number line -

55
00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:48,448
so we're starting at negative 7 and then...

56
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,364
- so this, the length of the line is negative 7 -

57
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:53,178
... and then we're adding 10 to it.

58
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:55,531
We are adding 10 to it.

59
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,011
So we're going to move 10 to the right.

60
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,782
If we move 7 to the right we get back to 0,

61
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:02,628
and then we're going to go another 3 after that.

62
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:05,445
So we're gonna go 7, 8, 9, 10.

63
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:08,092
So gets us to positive 3.

64
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:10,548
Another way to think about it is,

65
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:13,944
we are adding integers of different signs,

66
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:18,582
we can view this sum as going to be

67
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:20,346
the difference of the integers,

68
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:23,211
and since our larger integer is positive,

69
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:25,210
the answer will be positive.

70
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,731
So you could literally just view this as 10 minus 7.

71
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:29,861
10 minus 7 is 3.

72
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:34,796
So this becomes a 3, so the entire expression becomes negative 1.

73
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:37,459
Negative 1 times...

74
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:38,626
- and just to be clear:

75
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:40,962
brackets and parentheses are really the same thing

76
00:03:40,962 --> 00:03:43,829
Sometimes people will write brackets around a lot of parentheses

77
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,779
just to make it a little bit easier to read,

78
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:47,978
but they are really just the same thing as parentheses.

79
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,399
So these brackets are here,

80
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,734
I could just literally write them like that.

81
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:56,017
And then I have a minus 25 out over here.

82
00:03:56,017 --> 00:03:58,594
Now once again you wanna do multiplication or division

83
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:00,111
before we do addition and subtraction,

84
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:02,800
so it's multiplied the negative 1 times 3,

85
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,647
is negative 3.

86
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:07,234
And now we need to subtract our 25.

87
00:04:07,234 --> 00:04:10,209
So negative 3 minus 25,

88
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,058
we are adding two integers of the same sign.

89
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:14,632
We are already at negative 3,

90
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:16,589
it will become 25 more negative than that.

91
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,943
So you can view this as...

92
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:22,163
we are moving 25 more in the negative direction.

93
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:24,484
Or you can view this as 3 plus 25 is 28,

94
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:26,152
we're doing it in the negative direction,

95
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:27,963
so it's negative 28.

96
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:33,171
So this is equal to negative 28.

97
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,713
And we are done!
