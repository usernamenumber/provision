00:00:00,986 --> 00:00:03,750
Welcome to the logarithm presentation.

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:06,646
Let me write down the word "logarithm" just because

3
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:08,568
it is another strange an unusual word, like "hypotenuse",

4
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,690
and it's good to at least see it once.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,485
Let me get the pen tool working.

6
00:00:14,485 --> 00:00:19,970
Logarithm.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,470
This is one of my most misspelled words.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,290
I went to MIT and actually one of the a cappella groups there,

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,050
they were called the Logarhythms.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,710
Like rhythm, like music.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,990
But anyway, I'm digressing.

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,720
So what is a logarithm?

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,780
Well, the easiest way to explain what a logarithm is is

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,350
to have first-- I guess it's just to say it's the inverse of

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,130
taking the exponent of something.

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,240
Let me explain.

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,890
If I said that two to the third power-- well, we know that

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,100
from the exponent modules.

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,760
two the third power, well that's equal to eight.

20
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,820
And once again, this is a two, it's not a z.

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,520
two to the third power is eight, so it actually turns out that

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,570
log-- and log is short for the word logarithm.

23
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:13,190
Log base two of eight is equal to three.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,120
I think when you look at that you're trying to say oh,

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,190
that's trying to make a little bit of sense.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,720
What this says, if I were to ask you what log base two of

27
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,760
eight is, this says two to the what power is equal to eight?

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,050
So the answer to a logarithm-- you can say the answer to this

29
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,870
logarithm expression, or if you evaluate this logarithm

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,430
expression, you should get a number that is really the

31
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:42,300
exponent that you would have to raised two to to get eight.

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,960
And once again, that's three.

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,550
Let's do a couple more examples and I think you might get it.

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,680
If I were to say log-- what happened to my pen?

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:03,690
log base four of sixty-four is equal to x.

36
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,800
Another way of rewriting this exact equation is to say four to

37
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,210
the x power is equal to sixty-four.

38
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,780
Or another way to think about it, four to what

39
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,280
power is equal to sixty-four?

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,950
Well, we know that four to the third power is sixty-four.

41
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,940
So we know that in this case, this equals three.

42
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:36,110
So log base four of sixty-four is equal to three.

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,310
Let me do a bunch of more examples and I think the more

44
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,240
examples you see, it'll start to make some sense.

45
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,710
Logarithms are a simple idea, but I think they can get

46
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,960
confusing because they're the inverse of exponentiation,

47
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,370
which is sometimes itself, a confusing concept.

48
00:02:52,380 --> 00:03:05,770
So what is log base ten of let's say, one million.

49
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,530
Put some commas here to make sure.

50
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,480
So this equals question mark.

51
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,950
Well, all we have to ask ourselves is ten to what power

52
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,770
is equal to one million.

53
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,050
And ten to any power is actually equal to one followed by the

54
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,900
power of-- if you say ten of the fifth power, that's equal

55
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,930
to one followed by five zero's.

56
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,550
So if we have one followed by six zero's this is the same thing

57
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,340
as ten to the sixth power.

58
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,580
So ten to the sixth power is equal to one million.

59
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:47,160
So since ten to the sixth power is equal to one million log base

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:54,050
ten of one million is equal to six.

61
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,740
Just remember, this six is an exponent that we raise ten

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,630
to to get the one million.

63
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,450
I know I'm saying this in a hundred different ways and

64
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,190
hopefully, one or two of these million different ways that I'm

65
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,300
explaining it actually will make sense.

66
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,830
Let's do some more.

67
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,560
Actually, I'll do even a slightly confusing one.

68
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,780
log base one / two of one / eight.

69
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,250
Let's say that that equals x.

70
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,740
So let's just remind ourselves, that's just

71
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,040
like saying one / two-- whoops.

72
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,670
one / two.

73
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,270
That's supposed to be parentheses.

74
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,010
To the x power is equal to one / eight.

75
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,490
Well, we know that one / two to the third power is equal to one / eight.

76
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:54,760
So log base one / two of one / eight is equal to three.

77
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,260
Let me do a bunch of more problems.

78
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,840
Actually, let me mix it up a little bit.

79
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:13,670
Let's say that log base x of twenty-seven is equal to three.

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,480
What's x?

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,510
Well, just like what we did before, this says that x to the

82
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,780
third power is equal to twenty-seven.

83
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,350
Or x is equal to the cubed root of twenty-seven.

84
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,170
And all that means is that there's some number times

85
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,160
itself three times that equals twenty-seven.

86
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,730
And I think at this point you know that that

87
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,360
number would be three.

88
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,140
x equals three.

89
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:51,050
So we could write log base three of twenty-seven is equal to three.

90
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,100
Let me think of another example.

91
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,740
I'm only doing relatively small numbers because I don't have

92
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,050
a calculator with me and I have to do them in my head.

93
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:07,700
So what is log-- let me think about this.

94
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,430
What is log base one hundred of one?

95
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,680
This is a trick problem.

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,360
So once again, let's just say that this is equal

97
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,430
to question mark.

98
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,310
So remember this is log base one hundred hundred of one.

99
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,240
So this says one hundred to the question mark power

100
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,720
is equal to one.

101
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,950
Well, what do we have to raise-- if we have any number

102
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,510
and we raise it to what power, when do we get one?

103
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,780
Well, if you remember from the exponent rules, or actually not

104
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,470
the exponent rules, from the exponent modules, anything to

105
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,870
the zero-th power is equal to one.

106
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:51,310
So we could say one hundred to the zero power equals one.

107
00:06:51,320 --> 00:07:00,400
So we could say log base one hundred hundred of one is equal to zero

108
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,920
because one hundred to the zero-th power is equal to one.

109
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,860
Let me ask another question.

110
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:16,110
What if I were to ask you log, let's say base two of zero?

111
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,050
So what is that equal to?

112
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,320
Well, what I'm asking you, I'm saying two-- let's

113
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,150
say that equals x.

114
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,760
two to some power x is equal to zero.

115
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,420
So what is x?

116
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,570
Well, is there anything that I can raise two to

117
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,840
the power of to get zero?

118
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,780
No.

119
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,820
So this is undefined.

120
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,690
Undefined or no solution.

121
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,980
There's no number that I can raise two to the

122
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,430
power of and get zero.

123
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:51,300
Similarly if I were to ask you log base three of

124
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,190
let's say, negative one.

125
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,800
And we're assuming we're dealing with the real numbers,

126
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,620
which are most of the numbers that I think at this point

127
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,430
you have dealt with.

128
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,650
There's nothing I can raise three three to the power of to

129
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,230
get a negative number, so this is undefined.

130
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,500
So as long as you have a positive base here, this

131
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:21,370
number, in order to be defined, has to be greater than-- well,

132
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,670
it has to be greater than or equal-- no.

133
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,580
It has to be greater than zero.

134
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,200
Not equal to.

135
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,970
It cannot be zero and it cannot be negative.

136
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,010
Let's do a couple more problems.

137
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,340
I think I have another minute and a half.

138
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,380
You're already prepared to do the level one logarithms module,

139
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,230
but let's do a couple of more.

140
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:47,120
What is log base eight-- I'm going to do a slightly

141
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,490
tricky one-- of one / sixty-four.

142
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,930
Interesting.

143
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:00,000
We know that log base eight of sixty-four would equal two, right?

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,780
Because eight squared is equal to sixty-four.

145
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,230
But eight to what power equals one / sixty-four?

146
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,320
Well, we learned from the negative exponent module that

147
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,020
that is equal to negative two.

148
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,600
If you remember, eight to the negative two power is the same

149
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,230
thing as one / eight to the two power.

150
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,960
eight squared, which is equal to one / sixty-four.

151
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Interesting.

152
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,580
I'll leave this for you to think about.

153
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,590
When you take the inverse of whatever you're taking the

154
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,830
logarithm of, it turns the answer negative.

155
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,250
And we'll do a lot more logarithm problems and explore

156
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,870
a lot more of the properties of logarithms in future modules.

157
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,110
But I think you're ready at this point to do the level one

158
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,760
logarithm set of exercises.

159
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,590
See you in the next module.
