1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,760
If we're just dealing with two
dimensions, and we want to find

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,460
the area under a curve, we have
good tools in our toolkit

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,050
already to do it, and I'll
just remind us of our tools.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,430
so let's say, that's the
x-axis, that's the y-axis, let

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,450
me draw some arbitrary function
right here, and that's

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,130
my function f of x.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,210
And let's say we want to find
the area between x is equal to

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,810
a, so that's x equal to
a, and x is equal to b.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,140
We saw this many, many,
many videos ago.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,010
The way you can think about it,
is you take super small widths

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,610
of x, or super small
changes in x.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,350
We could call them delta x's,
but because they're so small,

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,650
we're going to call them a dx.

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,300
Super, infinitesimally
small changes in x.

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,780
And then you multiply them
times the value of f

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,300
of x at that point.

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,710
So you multiply it times the
height at that point, which

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,730
is the value of f of x.

20
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:01,210
So you get f of x times each of
these infinitesimally small

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,930
bases, that'll give you the
area of this infinitesimally

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,500
narrow rectangle right there.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,220
And since each of these guys
are infinitely small, you're

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,370
going to have an infinite
number of these rectangles

25
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,050
in order to fill the space.

26
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,480
You're going to have
an infinite number

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,880
of these, right?

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,250
And so the tool we use was
the definite integral.

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,970
The definite integral is a sum,
is an infinite sum of these

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,000
infinitely small areas,
or these infinitely

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,910
small rectangles.

32
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,790
And the notations that we
use, they would go from a b.

33
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,690
And we've done many videos
on how do you evaluate

34
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,230
these things.

35
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,010
I just want to remind
you, conceptually,

36
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,210
what this is saying.

37
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,000
This is conceptually saying,
let's take a small change in x,

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,620
multiply it times the height at
that point, and you're going to

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,740
have an infinite number of
these, because these x's are

40
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,110
super small, they're infinitely
small, so you're going to have

41
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,330
an infinite number of those.

42
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,880
So take an infinite sum of all
of those, from x is equal

43
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,630
to a to x is equal to b.

44
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,150
And that's just our standard
definite integral.

45
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,230
Now what I want to do in this
video is extend this, broaden

46
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,320
this a little bit, to solve, I
guess it maybe could say a

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,240
harder or a broader
class of problems.

48
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,380
Let's say that we are, let's
go to three dimensions now.

49
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,970
And I'll just draw
the x-y plane first.

50
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,820
Maybe I'll keep this, just to
kind of make the analogy clear.

51
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,450
I'm going to kind of
flatten this, so we

52
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,460
have some perspective.

53
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,490
So let's say that this right
here is the y-axis, kind of

54
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,750
going behind the screen.

55
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,410
You can imagine if I
just pushed on this

56
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,600
and knocked it down.

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,480
So that's the y-axis, and that
is my x-axis right there.

58
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,630
And let's say I some
path in the x-y plane.

59
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,460
And in order to really define a
path in the x-y plane, I'll

60
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,560
have to parameterize both
the x and y variables.

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,120
So let's say that x is equal
to, let me switch colors.

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,350
I'm using that orange too much.

63
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,050
Let's say that x is is equal to
some function of some parameter

64
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:08,450
t, and let's say y is equal to
some other function of that

65
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,320
same parameter t, and let's say
we're going to start, we're

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,090
going to have t go from, t is
going to be greater than or

67
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,840
equal to a, and then less
than or equal to b.

68
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,880
Now this will define a path in
the x-y plane, and if this

69
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,890
seems confusing, you might want
to review the videos on

70
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,430
parametric equations.

71
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,060
But essentially, when t is
equal to a, you're going to

72
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,320
have x is equal to, so t is
equal to a, you're going to

73
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,630
have x is equal to g of a,
and you're going to have

74
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,166
y is equal to h of a.

75
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,580
So you're going to have this
point right here, so maybe it

76
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,760
might be, I don't know, I'll
just draw a random point here.

77
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,970
When t is equal to a,
you're going to plot the

78
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,590
coordinate point g of a.

79
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,270
That's going to be
our x-coordinate.

80
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,030
This is g of a, right here.

81
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,320
And then our y-coordinate
is going to be h of a.

82
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,520
Right?

83
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,930
You just put t is equal to a
in each of these equations,

84
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,430
and then you get a
value for x and y.

85
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,450
So this coordinate right
here would be h of a.

86
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,940
And then, you would keep
incrementing t larger and

87
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,190
larger, until you get to b, but
you're going to get a series of

88
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,190
points that are going to
look something like that.

89
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,410
That right there is a curve, or
it's a path, in the x-y plane.

90
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,430
And you know, you're saying,
how does that relate

91
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,430
to that right now?

92
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,250
What are we doing?

93
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, let me just write a c
here, for saying, that's our

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,750
curve, our that's our path.

95
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,090
Now, let's say I have another
function that associates every

96
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,010
point in the x-y plane
with some value.

97
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,480
So let's say I have some
function, f of x y.

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,800
What it does is associate
every point on the x-y

99
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,170
plane with some value.

100
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,890
So let me plot f of x y.

101
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,360
Let me make a
vertical axis here.

102
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,460
We could do a different color.

103
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,090
Call it the f of x y axis,
maybe we could even call it

104
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,010
the z-axis, if you want to.

105
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,080
But some vertical
axis right there.

106
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,050
And for every point, so if you
give me an x and a y, and put

107
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,860
into my f of x y function, it's
going to give you some point.

108
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,160
So I can just draw some
type of a surface that

109
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,375
f of x y represents.

110
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,920
And this'll all become a lot
more concrete when I do

111
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,440
some concrete examples.

112
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,950
So let's say that f of x y
looks something like this.

113
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,890
I'm going to try my
best to draw it.

114
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,440
I'll do a different color.

115
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,090
Let's say f of x y.

116
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,730
Some surface.

117
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,795
I'll draw part of it.

118
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:29,230
It's some surface that
looks, let's say it looks

119
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,220
something like that.

120
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,680
That is f of x y.

121
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,310
And remember, all this is, is
you give me an x, you give me a

122
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,800
y, you pop it into f of x y,
it's going to give me some

123
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,060
third value that we're going to
plot in this vertical

124
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,780
axis right here.

125
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,760
I mean, example, f of x y?

126
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,110
It could be, I'm not saying
this is a particular case,

127
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,650
it could be x plus y.

128
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,300
It could be f of x y.

129
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,200
These are just examples.

130
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,750
It could be x times y.

131
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,350
If x is 1, y is 2, f of
x y will be 1 times 2.

132
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,110
But let's say when you plot,
for every point on the x-y

133
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,570
plane, when you plot f of x y
you get this surface up

134
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,600
here, and we want to do
something interesting.

135
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,130
We want to figure out, not the
area under this curve, this

136
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,230
was very simple when we
did it the first time.

137
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:19,640
I want to find the area if you
imagine a curtain, or a fence,

138
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,570
that goes along this curve.

139
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,750
You can imagine this being a
very straight linear path,

140
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,640
going just along the
x-axis from a to b.

141
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,330
Now we have this kind of crazy,
curvy path that's going

142
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,070
along the x-y plane.

143
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,030
And you can imagine if you drew
a wall, or curtain, or a fence

144
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,750
that went straight up from this
to my f of x y, let me do my

145
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,100
best effort to draw that.

146
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,790
Let me draw it.

147
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,550
So it's going to go up to
there, and maybe this point

148
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,140
corresponds to there.

149
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,480
And when you draw that curtain
up, it's going to intersect

150
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,720
it something like that.

151
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,940
Let's say it looks
something like that.

152
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,550
So this point right here
corresponds to that

153
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,080
point right there.

154
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,630
So if you imagine, you have a
curtain, f of x y is the roof,

155
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,620
and this is a, what I've drawn
here, this curve, this kind of

156
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,600
shows you the bottom of a wall.

157
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,660
This is some kind
of crazy wall.

158
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,250
And let me say, this point it
corresponds to, well, actually,

159
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,205
let me draw it little
bit different.

160
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:18,620
   

161
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,270
This point will correspond to
some point up here, so when you

162
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,800
trace where it intersects, it
will look something maybe

163
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,520
like that, I don't know.

164
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,410
Something like that.

165
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,220
And I'm trying my best to
help you visualize this.

166
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,836
So maybe I'll shade this in
to make it a little solid,

167
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:36,830
let's say f of x y is
little transparent.

168
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,500
You can see.

169
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,360
But you have this
curvy-looking wall here.

170
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,880
And the whole point of this
video is, how can we figure out

171
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,890
the area of this curvy-looking
wall, that's essentially the

172
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,475
wall or the fence that happens
if you go from this curve

173
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:56,166
and jump up, and hit the
ceiling at this f of x y?

174
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,770
So let's think a little bit
about how we can do it.

175
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,470
Well, if we just use the
analogy of what we did

176
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,860
previously, we could
say, well look.

177
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,740
   

178
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,120
Let's make a little change
in distance of our curve.

179
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,890
Let's call that ds.

180
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,740
That's a little change
in distance of my

181
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,060
curve, right there.

182
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,200
And if I multiply that change
in distance of the curve times

183
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:29,270
f of x y at that point, I'm
going to get the area of that

184
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,860
little rectangle right there.

185
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,190
Right?

186
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,550
So if I take the ds, my change
in my, you can imagine the arc

187
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,390
length of this curve at that
point, so let me write, you

188
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:51,330
know, ds is equal to super
small change in arc length of

189
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,880
our path, or of our curve.

190
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,200
That's our ds.

191
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,340
So you can imagine, the area of
that little rectangle right

192
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,640
there, along my curvy wall, is
going to be ds, I'll make it a

193
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,000
capital S, ds times the
height at that point.

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,760
Well, that's f of x y.

195
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,290
And then if I take the sum,
because these are infinitely

196
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,980
narrow, these ds's have
infinitely small width, if I

197
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,860
were take the infinite sum of
all of those guys, from t is

198
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:28,130
equal to a to t is equal to b,
right, from t is equal to a, I

199
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,610
keep taking the sum of those
rectangles, to t is equal

200
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,110
to b, right there, that
will give me my area.

201
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,370
I'm just using the exact same
logic as I did up there.

202
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,660
I'm not being very
mathematically rigorous, but I

203
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,690
want to give you the intuition
of what we're doing.

204
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,190
We're really just bending the
base of this thing to get a

205
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,360
curvy wall instead of a
straight, direct wall

206
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,270
like we had up here.

207
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,330
But you're saying, Sal, this is
all abstract, and how can I

208
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,800
even calculate something like
this, this makes no sense to

209
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,220
me, I have an s here, I have
an x and a y, I have a t,

210
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,520
what can I do with this?

211
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,850
And let's see if we can
make some headway.

212
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,440
And I promise you, when we do
it with a tangible problem,

213
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,420
the end product of this video
is going to be a little

214
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,410
bit hairy to look at.

215
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,030
But when we do it with an
actual problem, it'll actually,

216
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,310
I think, be very concrete, and
you'll see it's not too

217
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,060
hard to deal with.

218
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,790
But let's see if we can get
all of this in terms of t.

219
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,390
So first of all, let's
focus just on this ds.

220
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,070
So let me re-pick
up the x-y axis.

221
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,910
So if I were to reflip the
x-y, let me switch colors,

222
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,320
this is just getting
a little monotonous.

223
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,805
So if I were to reflip the x-y
axis like that, actually, let

224
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:35,010
me do that with that same
green, so you know we're

225
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,000
dealing with the same x-y axis.

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,340
So that's my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.

227
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,550
And so this path right here, if
I were to just draw it straight

228
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,045
up like this, it would
look something like this.

229
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:51,060
   

230
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,320
Right?

231
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,040
That's my path, my arc.

232
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,930
You know, this is when t is
equal to a, so this is t is

233
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,090
equal to a, this is
t is equal to b.

234
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,905
Same thing, I just kind
of picked it back up so

235
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:03,110
you can visualize it.

236
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,040
And we say that we have some
change in arc length, let's

237
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,880
say, let me switch colors.

238
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,210
Let's say that this
one right here.

239
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,470
Let's say that's some small
change in arc length, and

240
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,640
we're calling that ds.

241
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,200
Now, is there some way to
relate ds to infinitely

242
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,710
small changes in x or y?

243
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,730
Well, if we think about it, if
we really-- and this is all a

244
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,930
little bit hand-wavy, I'm not
being mathematically rigorous,

245
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,900
but I think it'll give you the
correct intuition-- if you

246
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,160
imagine this is, you can figure
out the length of ds if you

247
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,810
know the length of these
super small changes in x and

248
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,800
super small changes in y.

249
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,950
So if this distance right here
is ds, infinitesimally small

250
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,640
change in x, this distance
right here is dy,

251
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,090
infinitesimally small
change in y, right?

252
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,210
Then we could figure out ds
from the Pythagorean Theorem.

253
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:57,660
You can say that ds is going to
be, it's the hypotenuse of this

254
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:04,310
triang.e It's equal to the
square root of dx squared

255
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,920
plus dy squared.

256
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,090
So that seems to make things a
little bit, you know, we can

257
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,830
get rid of the ds
all of a sudden.

258
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,740
So let's rewrite this little
expression here, using this

259
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,850
sense of what ds, is really
the square root of dx

260
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,160
squared plus dy squared.

261
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,060
And I'm not being very
rigorous, and actually it's

262
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,360
very hard to be rigorous with
differentials, but intuitively

263
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,030
I think it makes
a lot of sense.

264
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,200
So we can say that this
integral, the area of this

265
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,080
curvy curtain, is going to be
the integral from t is equal to

266
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:44,390
a to t is equal to b of f of x
y, instead of writing ds, we

267
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:50,980
can write this, times the
square root of dx squared

268
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,860
plus dy squared.

269
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,290
Now we at least got rid of this
big capital S, but we still

270
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,010
haven't solved the problem of,
how do you solve something, you

271
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,090
know, an integral, a definite
integral that looks like this?

272
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,290
We have it in terms of t
here, but we only have it in

273
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,410
terms of x's and y's here.

274
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,490
So we need to get
everything in terms of t.

275
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,710
Well, we know x and y are both
functions of t, so we can

276
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,530
actually rewrite it like this.

277
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:18,220
We can rewrite it as from t is
equal to a, to t is equal to b.

278
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,800
And f of x y, we can write it,
f is a function of x, which is

279
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,630
a function of t, and f is also
a function of y, which is

280
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,510
also a function of t.

281
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,760
So you give me a t, I'll be
able to give you an x or y, and

282
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,630
once you give me an x or y,
I can figure out what f is.

283
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,320
So we have that, and then we
have this part right here.

284
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,100
I'll do it in orange.

285
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,380
Square root of dx squared
plus dy squared.

286
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,000
But we still don't have
things in terms of t.

287
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,360
We need a dt someplace
here in order be able to

288
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,460
evaluate this integral.

289
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,020
And we'll see that in the
next video, when I do

290
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,890
a concrete problem.

291
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,560
But I really want to give you a
sense for the end product, the

292
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,570
formula we're going to get
at the end product of this

293
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,070
video, where it comes from.

294
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,710
So one thing we can do, is if
we allow ourselves to

295
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,180
algebraically manipulate
differentials, what we can do

296
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,120
is let us multiply
and divide by dt.

297
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,510
So one way to think about it,
you could rewrite, so let me

298
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,130
just do this orange
part right here.

299
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,360
Let's do a little
side right here.

300
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,860
So if you take this orange
part, and write it in pink, and

301
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,460
you have dx squared, and then
you have plus dy squared, and

302
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,040
let's say you just multiply
it times dt over dt, right?

303
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,880
That's a small change in t,
divided by a small change in t.

304
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,500
That's 1, so of course you
can multiply it by that.

305
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,640
If we're to bring in this part
inside of the square root sign,

306
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,170
right, so let me rewrite this.

307
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,210
This is the same thing as 1
over dt times the square root

308
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:57,130
of dx squared plus dy squared,
and then times that dt.

309
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,420
Right?

310
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,670
I just wanted to write it
this way to show you I'm

311
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,040
just multiplying by 1.

312
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,740
And here, I'm just taking this
dt, writing it there, and

313
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,190
leaving this over here.

314
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,130
And now if I wanted to bring
this into the square root sign,

315
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,510
this is the same thing, this is
equal to, and I'll do it very

316
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,790
slowly, just to make sure, I'll
allow you to believe that I'm

317
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,650
not doing anything shady
with the algebra.

318
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,760
This is the same thing as the
square root of 1 over dt

319
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,520
squared, let me make the
radical a little bit bigger,

320
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,980
times dx squared plus
dy squared, and all of

321
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,410
that times dt, right?

322
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,250
I didn't do anything, you could
just take the square root of

323
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,080
this and you'd get 1 over dt.

324
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,680
And if I just distribute this,
this is equal to the square

325
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:46,770
root, and we have our dt at the
end, of dx squared, or we could

326
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:55,700
even write, dx over dt squared,
plus dy over dt squared.

327
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,590
Right? dx squared over dt
squared is just dx over dt

328
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,840
squared, same thing
with the y's.

329
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,100
And now all of a sudden,
this starts to look

330
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,880
pretty interesting.

331
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,130
Let's substitute this
expression with this one.

332
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,700
We said that these
are equivalent.

333
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,000
And I'll switch colors,
just for the sake of it.

334
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,470
So we have the integral.

335
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,250
From t is equal to a.

336
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,810
Let me get our drawing back, if
I-- from t is equal to a to t

337
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:26,050
is equal to b of f of x of t
times, or f of x of t and f of,

338
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,810
or and y of t, they're both
functions of t, and now instead

339
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,520
of this expression, we can
write the square root of, well,

340
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,490
what's dx, what's the change in
x with respect to, whatever

341
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,150
this parameter is?

342
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,700
What is dx dt?

343
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:55,950
dx dt is the same thing
as g prime of t.

344
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,660
Right? x is a function of t.

345
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,130
The function I wrote
is g prime of t.

346
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:06,400
And then dy dt is same
thing as h prime of t.

347
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,740
We could say that, you
know, this function of t.

348
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,690
So I just wanted to
make that clear.

349
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,760
We know these two functions,
so we can just take their

350
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,970
derivatives with respect to t.

351
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,680
But I'm just going to
leave it in that form.

352
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,550
So the square root, and we take
the derivative of x with

353
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:26,030
respect to t squared, plus the
derivative of y with respect to

354
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,320
t squared, and all
of that times dt.

355
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,780
And this might look like some
strange and convoluted formula,

356
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,130
but this is actually something
that we know how to deal with.

357
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,340
We've now simplified this
strange, you know, this

358
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,650
arc-length problem, or this
line integral, right?

359
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,760
That's essentially
what we're doing.

360
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
We're taking an integral over
a curve, or over a line,

361
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,530
as opposed to just an
interval on the x-axis.

362
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,690
We've taken the strange line
integral, that's in terms of

363
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,730
the arc length of the line, and
x's and y's, and we've put

364
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,170
everything in terms of t.

365
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,290
And I'm going to show you that
in the next video, right?

366
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,200
Everything is going to be
expressed in terms of t,

367
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,350
so this just turns into a
simple, definite integral.

368
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,030
So hopefully that didn't
confuse you too much.

369
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,080
I think you're going to see in
the next video that this, right

370
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,010
here, is actually a
very straightforward

371
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,850
thing to implement.

372
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,250
And just to remind you where
it all came from, I think I

373
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,470
got the parentheses right.

374
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,860
This right here was just a
change in our arc length.

375
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,390
That whole thing right
there was just a

376
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,330
change in arc length.

377
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,370
And this is just the height of
our function at that point.

378
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,820
And we're just summing it,
doing an infinite sum of

379
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,370
infinitely small lengths.

380
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,050
So this was a change in our
arc length times the height.

381
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,640
This is going to have an
infinitely narrow width, and

382
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,120
they're going to take an
infinite number of these

383
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,300
rectangles to get the area of
this entire fence, or

384
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,430
this entire curtain.

385
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,210
And that's what this definite
integral will give us,

386
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,270
and we'll actually apply
it in the next video.
