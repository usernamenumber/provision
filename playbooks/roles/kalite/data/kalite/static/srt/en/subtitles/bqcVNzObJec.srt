1
00:00:02,538 --> 00:00:04,369
So this is the first of a series of videos

2
00:00:04,369 --> 00:00:06,869
in which we show you how to build a âbeetle botâ

3
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:08,513
without using any solder.

4
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:11,285
This is our Khan Academy âSpoutâ beetle bot.

5
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:12,600
So it's got LED eyes,

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,377
and a bunch of different ways you can make it.

7
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:16,932
So the first thing we're going to do

8
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:19,283
is to organize all of our parts.

9
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:22,439
And weâre go through each of the different components.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,619
In this kit, we've got

11
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:24,749
2 bottle caps,

12
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:26,291
2 sliding switches,

13
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,578
2 single-pole-double-throw lever switches â

14
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:29,540
We also have

15
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,787
2 1.5 volt motors,

16
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:35,215
4 large paper clips,

17
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:36,274
and 2 AA batteries.

18
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:38,918
Youâll need a AA battery holder, as well.

19
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:41,119
And some hot glue,

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,294
2 LEDs,

21
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,537
and 2 resistors.

22
00:00:44,537 --> 00:00:45,535
Youâll want to make sure you pick

23
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:47,283
resistors that fit with those LEDs.

24
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:50,209
I believe those are under 60 ohm.

25
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:55,592
And then we have 5 multicolored wires.

26
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,452
Okay. So now weâre going to talk about

27
00:00:57,452 --> 00:00:59,415
the tools that you need to make this project work.

28
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:00,702
You're going to need ...

29
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:01,932
a hot glue gun.

30
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:03,787
(And any standard one will do.)

31
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:07,286
And needle-nosed pliers to crimp the wires together.

32
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:10,452
And youâll need something to strip the wires with.

33
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:11,953
You can either use a wire stripper

34
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:16,158
or scissors, if you like.

35
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:18,000
Alright. So let's get building.
