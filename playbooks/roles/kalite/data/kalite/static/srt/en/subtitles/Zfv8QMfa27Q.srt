1
00:00:00,535 --> 00:00:05,718
And we begin with a very simple question, or --

2
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:07,649
not a question -- a challenge.

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,645
We need to build a machine which takes an input --

4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,937
(And that input is some integer, 'x.')

5
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:16,350
And all that machine needs to do

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,648
is output 'true' or 'false.'

7
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,484
And that is the first step.

8
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,904
Now we will use the

9
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:28,236
[Khan Academy] computer-science tool

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:31,188
to actually build this machine together.

11
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:32,364
And one of the questions

12
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:35,803
that we will be asking is two things --

13
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,596
two aspects to this machine.

14
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:40,111
How much time --

15
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:41,547
That's a clock. [CHUCKLES]

16
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:44,545
How much time does it take to get the solution?

17
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,860
And how much space does it need?

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,373
And when I say 'space,'

19
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:50,664
I mean -- for example, in the case of

20
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:53,088
this mechanical calculator -- physical space.

21
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:55,624
How many rooms do we need to hold our machine?

22
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:57,729
Or if we're using a computer,

23
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:00,998
how much memory does it need?

24
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:02,354
So we will be returning

25
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,167
to these two ideas as we go.
