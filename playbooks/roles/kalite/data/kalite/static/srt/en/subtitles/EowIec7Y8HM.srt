00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,880
I want to do a quick video on
something that you're likely

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,960
to see in a statistics class,
and that's the notion of a

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,210
Type 1 Error.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,270
Type...type...type 1 error.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,280
And all this error means is that
you've rejected-- this is

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,310
the error of rejecting-- let
me do this in a different

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:25,300
color-- rejecting the
null hypothesis even

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,550
though it is true.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,700
Even though it is true.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,890
So for example, in a lot, in actually all
of the hypothesis testing

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,390
examples we've seen, we start
assuming that the null

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,980
hypothesis is true. We assume...

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,960
We always assume that the
null hypothesis is true.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,150
And given that the null
hypothesis is true, we say OK,

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,670
if the null hypothesis is true
then the mean is usually going

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,710
to be equal to some value.

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,620
So we create some
distribution.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,310
Assuming that the null
hypothesis is true, it

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,060
normally has some mean value
right over there.

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:10,160
Then we have some statistic and
we're seeing if the null

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,260
hypothesis is true, what is
the probability of getting

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,070
that statistic, or getting a
result that extreme or more

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,230
extreme then that statistic.

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,220
So let's say that the statistic
gives us some value

25
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,530
over here, and we say gee, you
know what, there's only, I

26
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,620
don't know, there might be a 1%
chance, there's only a 1%

27
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,410
probability of getting a result

28
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,570
that extreme or greater.

29
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,220
And then if that's low enough of
a threshold for us, we will

30
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,440
reject the null hypothesis.

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,150
So in this case we will--
so actually let's

32
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,720
think of it this way.

33
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,680
Let's say that 1% is
our threshold.

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,820
We say look, we're going
to assume that the null

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,660
hypothesis is true.

36
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,700
There's some threshold that
if we get a value any more

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,860
extreme than that value, there's
less than a 1% chance

38
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,670
of that happening.

39
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,680
So let's say we're looking
at sample means.

40
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,920
We get a sample mean that
is way out here.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,260
We say, well, there's less
than a 1% chance of that

42
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,900
happening given that the null
hypothesis is true.

43
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,020
So we are going to reject
the null hypothesis.

44
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,620
So we will reject the
null hypothesis.

45
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,510
Now what does that
mean though?

46
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,540
Let's say that this area, the
probability of getting a

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,580
result like that or that much
more extreme is just this area

48
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,100
right here.

49
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,250
So let's say that's 0.5%, or
maybe I can write it this way.

50
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,920
Let's say it's 0.5%.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,950
And because it's so unlikely to
get a statistic like that

52
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,280
assuming that the null
hypothesis is true, we decide

53
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,260
to reject the null hypothesis.

54
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,890
Or another way to view it is
there's a 0.5% chance that we

55
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,470
have made a Type 1 Error in
rejecting the null hypothesis.

56
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,150
Because if the null hypothesis
is true there's a 0.5% chance

57
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,240
that this could still happen.

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,500
So in rejecting it we would
make a mistake.

59
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,460
There's a 0.5% chance we've
made a Type 1 Error.

60
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,700
I just want to clear that up.

61
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,130
Hopefully that clarified
it for you.

62
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,920
It's sometimes a little
bit confusing.

63
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,010
But we're going to use what we
learned in this video and the

64
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,980
previous video to now tackle
an actual example.
