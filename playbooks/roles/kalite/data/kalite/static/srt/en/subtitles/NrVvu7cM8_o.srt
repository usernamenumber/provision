00:00:00,541 --> 00:00:05,040
Find the sum of 15 plus -46 plus 29.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,460
So lets just think about the first part over here

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:16,324
We have 15 plus -46, we will worry about +29 later on.

4
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:27,283
So lets do 15 plus -46. We will get a different color.

5
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:30,928
We will do it orange. Plus -46.

6
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:32,273
So we draw a number line here.

7
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:36,129
Just we can properly visualize what is going on.

8
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:39,793
That's my number line.

9
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:46,579
We are starting 15. Let me put 0 over here and we're starting with 15.

10
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:56,345
15 could be right over here. So this is 15. Let me draw a big fat arrow to signify this is 15

11
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:58,462
15 has an absolute value of 15.

12
00:00:58,462 --> 00:01:01,868
So the length of this arrow would be 15.

13
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:07,500
Now, we are adding -46 to that 15, that is the same thing...

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,048
This is equaivalent to 15-46, which means we are going to move

15
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:17,063
46 spots to the left of 15.

16
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:21,056
Negative sign or minus needs to be the left on the number line.

17
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:23,754
So we are going to 46 to the left.

18
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:31,261
So we are starting with 15 and we are going to move 46 to the left.

19
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:38,070
The length of this arrow right here is going to be 46.

20
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,374
We are moving to the left. This is the negative 46 we are adding to the 15.

21
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:47,224
We are going to end up at some point over here.

22
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:53,020
That point is clearly 0. We were 15 to the right. Now we are goig to move 46 to the left.

23
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,354
So we are definitely going to be the left of 0.

24
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:57,236
So it's definitely going to a negative number.

25
00:01:57,236 --> 00:02:02,781
We can even think about the absolute value of that negative number. We can just visualize it.

26
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:08,608
This yellow arrow has the length of 15 and this orange arrow has the length of 46

27
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:12,535
The blue arrow that I am going about to draw which is the sum of these two

28
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:17,884
is going to be have this length, right over here.

29
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:22,853
And just visually, how can we figure out the length of the blue part.

30
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:26,677
If we know the length of this orange part and we know the length of this yellow part.

31
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:28,593
Well, it's just going to be the difference.

32
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:32,856
It's just going to be the difference of these two. So the absolute value of the sum is

33
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:37,467
going to be the difference between this length 46 and 15.

34
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:45,775
So this is 46... Let me just figure it out. 46 - 15. 6 - 5 is 1, 4 - 1 is 3.

35
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:48,380
The length of this is going to be 31.

36
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:56,248
and it's going to be 31 to the left of 0. This is going to be -31, right over here.

37
00:02:56,248 --> 00:03:01,935
So we know the first part over here is -31 and then to that

38
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:07,806
we are going to add 29. Let me do that another color.

39
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:11,461
So what does that mean. That means we start at -31.

40
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:15,464
So we are gonna move 29 to the right. We are adding 29.

41
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:23,885
So we are gonna to move 29 to the right. Maybe that is right about there. The arrow of length 29.

42
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:29,756
I can draw a cleaner looking arrow than that. I'll do it right over here actually.

43
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:34,799
So then we are going to 29 over to the right.

44
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,195
That's the 29 part.

45
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:40,858
So now this is the positive 29.

46
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:43,053
So how do we figure out what this is.

47
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:48,264
So this is going to land us... So this number, ... This is 29 right here that we are adding.

48
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:51,789
This is going to land us right over here on the number line

49
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:54,118
So how do we figure out that number that is?

50
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:58,189
Well, once again we can just visualize it and eventually you want to draw a number line and the stuffs.

51
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,876
I think it'll be useful here. The number we are going to do.

52
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:04,932
We are starting from -31 and adding 29 to it.

53
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:08,988
Since we are adding a number less than -31,

54
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:10,745
we are not going to get all the way back to 0.

55
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:15,856
So we are stilll going to have a negative number

56
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:19,454
But how to figure out the absolute value of that negative number, it's distance.

57
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:25,485
Once again, the little white part right there, that white part plus this 29 is going to equal to 31.

58
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:28,146
If we just think of the absolute value.

59
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:30,863
If we don't think about the signs, we just think about the length.

60
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:36,453
Or another way to think about is, 31-29 will give us the length of the white part

61
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:41,789
and of course it's going to be negative. Because the negative number here is larger than the positive number.

62
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:43,321
We are adding the two.

63
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:54,143
So, 31-29, you can borrow and all of that. But it's clearly just going to equal to 2. You could say, that's 11, this is 2.

64
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:01,119
Subtract. This is equal to 2. Since it is -31 plus 29, it's going to be a negative 2.

65
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:05,471
We are still going to stay negative. We haven't moved far to the right enough to pass 0.

66
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,537
This right here is going to be negative 2.

67
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:13,185
Or another way to think about is that the length of the white bar, the absolute value is going to be 2.

68
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:20,020
2 + 29 is 31. We are operating to left to 0. So it's negative 31. This is -2.

69
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,803
Anyway, hopefully you found that useful.

70
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:24,119
Oh anyway, I would like to make it clear.

71
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:31,303
So our final answer is negative 2.
