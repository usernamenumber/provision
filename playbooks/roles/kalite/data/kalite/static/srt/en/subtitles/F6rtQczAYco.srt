1
00:00:00,115 --> 00:00:05,681
Maria and Nadia drive from Philadelphia to Toronto to visit their friend.

2
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:09,717
They take two days for the trip, stopping along the way for sightseeing.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,508
To conserve on gas mileage,they drive at a constant speed for the entire trip.

4
00:00:16,508 --> 00:00:20,160
Alright, which of the following equations, where x represents hours

5
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:27,322
and y represents miles, represents a speed that is greater than Maria and Nadia's speed.

6
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:28,991
Select all that apply.

7
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:31,690
So let's think about what's happening here.

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:37,895
So in Day 1, they travel for 4 hours, and they go 240 miles.

9
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:42,136
So if we wanted to figure out their speed, you would figure out distance divided by time.

10
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:45,470
So they traveled 240 miles in 4 hours.

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:54,628
240 divided by 4 is, or 240 miles divided by 4 hours, is 60 miles per hour.

12
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:56,435
So they're going 60 miles per hour.

13
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:58,365
And assuming they went on a constant speed the whole time,

14
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:01,386
they should have been going 60 miles per hour on Day 2 as well.

15
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:07,003
And we can verify that. 60 miles per hour times 5 hours is indeed 300 miles.

16
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:09,162
or 300 divided by 5 is 60.

17
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:11,000
So they went 60 miles per hour.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,135
So which of these equations represent a relation between time elapsed in hours and distance,

19
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,782
that represents faster than 60 miles per hour.

20
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:27,730
Well, this is, here you're taking the time times 60 to get distance, which is what we did over here.

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,104
Time times 60 to get distance, which is exactly their speed.

22
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:33,429
But we care about a speed that is greater.

23
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,342
And so pretty much all of these other coefficients are faster.

24
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:40,345
So here you're taking your time, times 65 miles per hour to get.

25
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:43,528
So you're going to go more distance, more than 60 miles per hour.

26
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:46,169
In this situation, here you're going 70 miles per hour.

27
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:49,081
Here you're going 80 miles per hour.

28
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:51,196
Well we got it right. Let's do 1 more.

29
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:58,857
Some vinyl records (let's call them "Oldies") rotate at the rate of 78 revolutions per minute.

30
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:05,663
The chart below shows revolutions per minute for three different tracks on another type of vinyl record called "Goodies".

31
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:10,460
Which has a greater rate of revolution, Oldies or Goodies?

32
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,724
So Oldies are at 78 revolutions per minute.

33
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,912
Let's think about these revolutions per minute right over here.

34
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,420
So in 3 minutes, this one makes a 135 revolutions.

35
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,706
So how many per minute? So if we divide revolutions by minutes, you're going to get

36
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:31,047
let's see, 3 goes into 135... it looks like it would go into, let's see 3 goes into 100 twenty... forty times.

37
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:33,280
So it looks like it goes forty-five times.

38
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:37,238
So it's 45 revolutions per minute for Track 1.

39
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:44,201
Track 2 is also 45. 4 times 45, if I have 45 revolutions per minute times 4 minutes,

40
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:46,366
(that's 160 plus 20) yep, that's 180.

41
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,943
So these are all 45 revolutions per minute.

42
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:54,608
You can multiply 5 times, 5 minutes times 45 revolutions per minute, you're going to get 225.

43
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,158
So the Oldies go at 78 rpm,

44
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,526
So they do 78 revolutions in a minute while the Goodies go 45.

45
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:06,565
So the Oldies go at... do more revolutions in a minute.

46
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:10,565
So Oldies have a greater rate of revolution per minute, or rotate, well, at least have a greater rate of revolution per minute.
