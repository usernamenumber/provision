1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,000
I've got a square here.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,060
What makes it a square is
all of the sides are equal.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,380
I haven't gone in depth into
angles yet, but these are at

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,520
right angles to each other.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,470
I'll just draw it like that.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,760
That means that if this bottom
side goes straight left and

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,880
right, that this left side
will go straight up and down.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,210
That's all the right
angle really means.

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,290
Let's say that the side down
here is equal to 8 meters.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,540
This side right here.

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,100
And this is a square.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,980
And I were to ask you what
is the area of the square?

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,040
Well, the area is essentially
how much space the square

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,430
takes up, let's say, on
your screen right now.

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,040
So it's essentially a way of
measuring how much space

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,110
something takes up on kind of
a two-dimensional surface.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,170
A two-dimensional surface would
just be this computer screen or

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,530
your piece of paper, if you're
also doing this problem.

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,680
An analogy would be if you had
an 8 meter by 8 meter room, how

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,570
much carpeting would you need
is kind of the size of the

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,240
space you need to fill out in
two dimensions on some

22
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,500
type of surface.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,750
So the area here is literally
how much is this size that

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,980
you're filling up, and it's
very easy to figure

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,605
out for a square.

26
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,830
It's literally going to be your
base times your height -- and

27
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,570
this is true for any rectangle
-- but since this is a square,

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,650
your base and your height are
going to be the same number.

29
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,340
It's going to be 8 meters.

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,930
So your area is going to be 8
meters times 8 meters, which is

31
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,020
equal to 8 times 8 is 64, and
then your meters times your

32
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,580
meters -- you have to do the
same thing with your units --

33
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,200
you get 64 meters squared.

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,860
Or another way of saying,
this is 64 square meters.

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,390
You might be asking where
are those 64 square meters?

36
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,615
Well, you can actually
break it out here.

37
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:48,470
So let me draw it a
little bit bigger than

38
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,630
I originally drew it.

39
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,890
I probably should have drawn
it this big to begin with.

40
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,940
So let's say that's
my same square.

41
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,100
I'm going to draw a little
bit, so let me divide

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,240
it in the middle.

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,770
Let me see, I have -- and
we divide them again.

44
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,142
Then we divide each side
again just like that.

45
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:08,410
I could probably do it neater.

46
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,930
And let me do it one more time.

47
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:16,840
Divide these just like that,
and then divide these

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,010
just like that.

49
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,940
There you go.

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,480
OK.

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,980
Now the reason why I did this
is to show you the dimensions

52
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,030
along the base and the height.

53
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,650
We said this is 8 meters,
and notice I have 1, 2,

54
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,610
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 meters.

55
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,620
And the same thing
along this side.

56
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,050
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 meters.

57
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,340
So when we're talking about
64 square meters, we're

58
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,520
literally counting each
of the square meters.

59
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,380
A square meter is a
two-dimensional measurement,

60
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,780
that's 1 meter on each side.

61
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,490
That's 1 meter, that's 1 meter.

62
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,480
What I'm shading here in
yellow is 1 square meter.

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,030
And you could imagine just
counting the square meters.

64
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,070
In each row we're going to
have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

65
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,080
7, 8 square meters.

66
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,610
And then we have 8 rows.

67
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,200
So we're going to have 8
times 8 square meters

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,760
or 64 meters square.

69
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,840
Which is essentially if you sat
here and just counted each of

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,050
these, you would count
64 square meters.

71
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,540
Now, what happens if I
were to ask you the

72
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,690
perimeter of my square?

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,620
The perimeter is the distance
you need to go to go

74
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,950
around the square.

75
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,990
It's not measuring,
for example, how much

76
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,070
carpeting you need.

77
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,520
It's measuring, for example, if
you wanted to put a fence

78
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,050
around your carpet -- I'm kind
of mixing the indoor and

79
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,400
outdoor analogies -- it would
be how much fencing

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,110
you would need.

81
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,210
So it would be the
distance around.

82
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,950
So it would be that distance
plus that distance plus that

83
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,980
distance plus that distance.

84
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,830
But we already know this
distance right here on the

85
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,020
bottom, we already know
this distance is 8 meters.

86
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,480
Then we know that the height
right here is 8 meters.

87
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,180
It's a square.

88
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,570
This distance up here is going
to be the same as this distance

89
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,710
down here -- it's going
to be another 8 meters.

90
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,450
Then when you go down the
left hand side it's going

91
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,380
to be another 8 meters.

92
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,670
We have four sides -- 1, 2, 3,
4 -- each of them are 8 meters.

93
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,660
So you add 8 to itself 4 times,
that's the same thing as 8

94
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,070
times 4, you get 36 meters.

95
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,050
Now notice, when we measured
just the amount of fencing we

96
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,530
needed, we ended up just with
meters, just with kind of a

97
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,680
one-dimensional measurement.

98
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,080
That's because we're not
measuring square meters here.

99
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,310
We're not measuring how
much area we're taking up.

100
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,560
We're measuring a distance
-- a distance to go around.

101
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,920
We are taking turns, but you
can imagine straightening out

102
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,570
this fence, and it would just
become one big fence like this,

103
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,160
which would have the same
length of 36 meters.

104
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,010
So that's why we just have
meters there for perimeter.

105
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,640
But for area we got square
meters, because we're counting

106
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,220
these two-dimensional
measurements.

107
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,840
Now, let's make it a little
bit more interesting.

108
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,070
What happens if instead
of a square I have a

109
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,780
rectangle like this?

110
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,280
Let's say that this side
over here is 7 centimeters.

111
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:23,170
And let's say that the height
right here is 4 centimeters.

112
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,845
So what is the area of this
rectangle going to be?

113
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:28,280
It's going to be 7
times 4 centimeters.

114
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,490
7 centimeters times
4 centimeters.

115
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,390
Remember, we could draw 7 rows,
right, and each of them is

116
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,540
going to have 4 square
centimeters -- each of those

117
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,380
is a square centimeter.

118
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,360
So if you were to count them
all out, you'd have 7 times

119
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,170
4 square centimeters.

120
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,140
It's 4 centimeters.

121
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,390
So it's equal to 28 centimeters
square or squared centimeters.

122
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,070
What's the perimeter?

123
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,660
Well, it's going to be equal to
this distance down here, which

124
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,670
is 7 centimeters, plus this
distance over here which is 4

125
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,480
centimeters, plus the distance
on the top -- this is a

126
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,170
rectangle, it's going to be
the same distance as

127
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,440
this one over here.

128
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,170
So plus another 7 centimeters.

129
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,300
Then you're going to have this
distance on the left hand side.

130
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,870
But this distance on the left
hand side is the same as this

131
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,810
distance right here -- this
is also 4 centimeters.

132
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,450
So plus another 4 centimeters.

133
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,450
And what do you get?

134
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,570
You get 7 plus 4 which is
11, and then you have

135
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,020
another 7 plus 4.

136
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,020
You have 11 plus 11, so
you have 22 centimeters.

137
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,300
Once again, it's not
a square centimeter.

138
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Now let's divert -- let's go
away from our rectangle analogy

139
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,760
or our rectangle examples.

140
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,930
So let's see if we can do
the same with triangles.

141
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,940
So let's say I have
a triangle here.

142
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,100
I have a triangle like this.

143
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,720
Let's say that this distance
right here -- actually

144
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,760
let me draw it like this.

145
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,210
I think this'll make it a
little bit easier for you

146
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,550
to see how this relates
to a rectangle.

147
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,810
Let me draw it like this.

148
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,810
There you go.

149
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,300
That's my triangle.

150
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,510
And let's say that this
distance right here is 7

151
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,210
centimeters right down there.

152
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,090
And let's say that the
height of this triangle

153
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,520
is 4 centimeters.

154
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,160
And I were to ask you what is
the area of the triangle?

155
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,590
Well, when we had a rectangle
like this, we just

156
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,660
multiplied 7 times 4.

157
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,600
But what would that give us?

158
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,610
That would give us the area
of an entire rectangle.

159
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,610
If we did 7 times 4, that
would give us the area of

160
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,050
this entire rectangle.

161
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,640
You could imagine extending
my triangle up like this.

162
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,880
This is a right triangle --
this is going straight up and

163
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,420
down, this is going straight
left and right on the

164
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,910
bottom right here.

165
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,910
It's a 90 degree angle, if
you've been exposed to the

166
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,040
idea of angles already.

167
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,460
So you could almost view it as
it's 1/2 of this rectangle.

168
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,610
Not really almost, it is.

169
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,580
Because if you just double this
guy, you could imagine if you

170
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,190
flip this triangle over, you
get the same triangle but

171
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,910
it's just upside down
and flipped over.

172
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,650
So if you think about when you
multiply 7 times 4, you're

173
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:25,140
getting the area of this entire
rectangle, which we

174
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,800
just did up here.

175
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,210
But we want to know the
area of the triangle.

176
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,190
We want to know just
this area right here.

177
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,290
You can see, hopefully, from
this drawing that the area of

178
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,390
this triangle is exactly 1/2
of the area of the

179
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,990
entire rectangle.

180
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:47,040
So the area for a triangle is
equal to the base times the

181
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,490
height -- now this so far,
base times height is the

182
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,150
area of a rectangle.

183
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,755
So in order to get the area of
the triangle, you're going

184
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,910
to multiply that times 1/2.

185
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,160
So 1/2 base times height.

186
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,320
So in our example it's going
to be 1/2 times 7 centimeters

187
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,020
times 4 centimeters.

188
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,780
We know what 7 times 4 is.

189
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,880
We already know it's
28 centimeters -- we

190
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,710
did that up there.

191
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,050
So this right here
is 28 centimeters.

192
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,070
Then we want centimeters and we
want to multiply that by 1/2.

193
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,720
So that's going to be 14
centimeters just like that.

194
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,950
So the area of this triangle
is exactly 1/2 of the

195
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,700
area of that rectangle.

196
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,670
Now, the perimeter of this
triangle becomes a little bit

197
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:43,380
more complicated because
figuring out this distance

198
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,320
isn't the easiest
thing in the world.

199
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,965
Well, it will be easy for
you once you get exposed to

200
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:48,870
the Pythagorean Theorem.

201
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,290
But I'm going to skip
that right now.

202
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,010
I'm going to leave that for the
Pythagorean Theorem video.

203
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,450
Let me just give you one
more area of a triangle.

204
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,120
Let's say I have a triangle
that looks like this.

205
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,190
This was a very special case
that I drew to make it look

206
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,520
like half of a rectangle.

207
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,220
Let's say we had a triangle
that looks like this.

208
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,650
It's a little bit more
skewed looking like this.

209
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:19,346
And let's say that this
distance down here is 3 meters

210
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:21,950
-- that distance is 3 meters.

211
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,230
Let's say we don't know what
that distance is and we don't

212
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,570
know what that distance is.

213
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,660
But we do know that if we were
to kind of drop a line straight

214
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,670
down like this -- if you
imagine this was a building or

215
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,760
some type of mountain and you
just drop something straight

216
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,850
down onto the ground like that,
we know that this distance

217
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,770
is equal to -- let's say
it's equal to 4 meters.

218
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,140
So what is the area of this
triangle going to be?

219
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,910
Well, we apply the
same formula.

220
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,170
Area is equal to 1/2
base times height.

221
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,490
So it's equal to 1/2 -- the
base is literally this base

222
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,260
right here of this triangle.

223
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,380
So 1/2 times 3 times the
height of the triangle.

224
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,740
I guess a better way
to think of it is an

225
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,570
altitude of the triangle.

226
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,760
So this thing isn't even in
the triangle, but it is

227
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,820
literally the height.

228
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,850
If you imagine this was a
building, you say how high is

229
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,360
the building, it would be
this height right there.

230
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,395
So 1/2 times 3 times 4.

231
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,880
You use that distance
right there.

232
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,860
Which is equal to 3 times 4 is
12 times 1/2 is equal to 6.

233
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,830
We're going to be dealing
with square meters.

234
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,140
I really want to highlight the
idea, because if I gave you a

235
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:40,000
triangle that looked like this,
where if this was 3 meters down

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,250
here, and then if I were to
tell you that this side over

237
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:50,930
here is 4 meters, this is not
something that you can just

238
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,820
apply this formula
to and figure out.

239
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,790
In fact, you'd have to know
some of the angles and whatnot

240
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,840
to really be able to figure out
the area, or you'd have to

241
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,350
know this other side here.

242
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,480
So this is not easy.

243
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,890
You have to know what the
altitude or the height

244
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,720
of the triangle is.

245
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,900
You need to know this distance.

246
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,330
In this case, it was one of
the sides, but in this case

247
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,290
it's not one of the sides.

248
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,840
You'd have to figure out what
that side right there on the

249
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,590
right hand side is in order
to apply this formula.
