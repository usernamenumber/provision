1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:04,481
Given that the Chinese Central Bank is printing yuan

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:08,290
in order to keep it devalued to other foreign currencies

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,683
--especially relative to the dollar--

4
00:00:09,683 --> 00:00:12,098
a question that may have jumped into your brain is:

5
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:14,884
"Is this causing inflation?"

6
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:18,274
And when I'm talking about inflation, I'm talking about price inflation:

7
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:23,067
Is it making a basket of goods in China more expensive?

8
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:27,283
And the other type of inflation that the word 'inflation' is sometimes referring to is

9
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:29,698
'monetary inflation,' that by definition is increasing.

10
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:32,067
They are definitely increasing the money supply,

11
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:36,386
but is it making the price of goods and services in China more expensive?

12
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:40,380
And to answer that question I have this article here from the NYTimes,

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,188
by Keith Bradsher, and he writes,

14
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:50,782
"In China, consumer prices were 5.1% higher in November than a year earlier."

15
00:00:50,782 --> 00:00:55,194
Remember, in the US we try to target inflation to be between 1 and 3%.

16
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:58,398
So, the official government data--this is according to official government data--

17
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:02,392
they admit that their inflation is at 5.1%.

18
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:04,807
But the next sentence is even more interesting:

19
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:10,612
"And many economists say the official figures actually understate the rate of inflation,

20
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:14,002
which might in reality be twice as high."

21
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:17,392
And there are tons of ways to engineer the actual inflation

22
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:20,596
depending on what the basket of goods is and how you adjust for things

23
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:25,380
"Now, though, that cheap currency policy seems to be reaching its limits.

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,185
The extra renminbi [and this is a point of confusion when talking about the currency of China...

25
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:36,386
The renminbi is the name of the currency, while

26
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:39,776
the Yuan is the name people use when they say,

27
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:43,213
"Hey, I gave you five yuan." Or, "You owe me five yuan."

28
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:45,581
They wouldn't say, "You owe me five renminbi."

29
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,392
And a good analogy is:

30
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:50,597
if you go to Great Britain and buy something, they'll say,

31
00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:54,776
"You owe five pounds." So, in Great Britain, five pounds is what they say,

32
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:59,606
when you're actually buying something, but the name of the currency is called the 'sterling.'

33
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:05,597
It's kind of like, people the 'dollar' 'US Legal Tender.'

34
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:08,569
That's the equivalent of 'renminbi,' whereas the yuan

35
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,194
might be like the dollar.

36
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:17,578
So five pounds is called the sterling, five yuan is called the renminbi.

37
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:23,615
So, they're saying that the extra renminbi are feeding inflation.

38
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:27,609
That is, starting to undermine exporters' price competitiveness.

39
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:33,786
Just as a stronger renminbi would do if Beijing were not intervening to begin with.

40
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:37,640
So the whole reason why they're printing this money is to keep the currency devalued.

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,030
But that is making things more expensive, in terms of yuan.

42
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,210
So, in the end, that's kinda counter-acting some of this cheap currency policy...

43
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,996
it's making their exports more expensive.

44
00:02:47,996 --> 00:02:51,619
"Money supply figures for December, which the central bank released on Tuesday,

45
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:58,585
showed that cash and bank deposits were increasing at a rate twice as fast as even China's soaring economy.

46
00:02:58,585 --> 00:03:03,182
So, if you increase the money supply roughly in line with the growth in the economy

47
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,597
then you wouldn't experience too much inflation,

48
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:07,826
but they're experiencing it twice as fast.

49
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:11,170
" Ever more renminbi are available to buy goods and services."

50
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,188
So you see, they deliberately trying to keep their currency devalued,

51
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:17,811
but they're reaching kinda a breaking-point where they

52
00:03:17,811 --> 99:59:59,999
won't be able to do it as aggressively going forward.
