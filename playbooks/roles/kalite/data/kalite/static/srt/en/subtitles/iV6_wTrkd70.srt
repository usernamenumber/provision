[music]

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,631
We're in Santa Maria della Grazie, in Milan,

3
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:10,527
looking at Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper."

4
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:12,381
And we're in the room where the monks would eat,

5
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:15,098
the refectory, and so several times a day

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,933
the monks would come in here and eat silently,

7
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,086
and be able to look up at Leonardo's "Last Supper."

8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,317
It's an ideal place, of course, for this particular subject,

9
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:23,729
and not an uncommon one.

10
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:25,445
So let's talk about the story.

11
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:27,251
At the last supper, Christ says,

12
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:30,535
"One of you will betray me," to his twelve apostles.

13
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:33,200
And one of the ways that this painting is often read

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,773
is as a reaction to that moment. That is,

15
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:39,192
this is not the moment when Christ utters that,

16
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:41,727
but the moment after, when the reaction takes place.

17
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:43,644
These are his closest followers, and so

18
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:46,545
this is terribly shocking. And so what we see

19
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:51,176
is this incredible set of reactions from the apostles around the table.

20
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,765
So that's one way we can understand the fresco.

21
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,964
But there's another aspect of the narrative.

22
00:00:55,964 --> 00:00:58,093
Which is in some ways even more important.

23
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:03,466
Christ, you can see, is reaching towards both a glass of wine, and towards bread.

24
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:06,622
And this is the institution of the sacrament.

25
00:01:06,622 --> 00:01:10,098
The sacrament of the Eucharist, we might know it as Holy Communion,

26
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:13,803
where Christ says, "Take this bread, for this is my body.

27
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:16,934
Take this wine, for this is my blood; and remember me."

28
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:20,961
And you can see that he reaches out toward the bread and the wine.

29
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:25,224
But what's interesting is that Christ's hand is widely spread,

30
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:27,393
so it seems as if he's reaching towards the wine,

31
00:01:27,393 --> 00:01:29,996
but at the same time he's reaching toward a bowl,

32
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:33,976
and at the same moment, Judas is reaching towards that same bowl.

33
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:36,605
Judas is the one who's going to betray Christ.

34
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:40,100
He's been paid thirty pieces of silver by the Romans,

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,137
and you can see he's grasped that bag of silver in his right hand,

36
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:48,315
as he pulls away from Christ, his face cast in shadow.

37
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:51,859
But he's pulling away at the same time that he's still reaching out to the bowl,

38
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:55,621
and that's one of the ways that Christ identifies who will betray him,

39
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,769
the person who shares, who dips with him in that bowl.

40
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,319
It's interesting, because the history of - the art history about this painting -

41
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,862
is really about scholars arguing about what moment this is.

42
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:10,441
[chuckling] But I think there are all of these moments here,

43
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:15,535
and the apostles could just as easily be understood as reacting to Christ's words,

44
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,697
"One of you will betray me," as they could to Christ saying,

45
00:02:18,697 --> 00:02:20,379
"Take the bread, for this is my body;

46
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:22,411
and take the wine, for this is my blood."

47
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:25,597
So Leonardo tells us several moments in this story,

48
00:02:25,597 --> 00:02:31,864
and at the same time gives us a sense of the divine, eternal importance of this story.

49
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:35,650
I mean, we would never mistake this for thirteen people having dinner.

50
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,225
We know that this is the Last Supper.

51
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:39,148
We know that this is an important moment,

52
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:42,346
but without any of the obvious symbols of the Divine

53
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:45,004
that we would have in the early Renaissance, like the halo.

54
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:48,381
The figures themselves are monumental in this space,

55
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:51,221
and too crowded for that table,

56
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:54,199
creating a kind of energy, a kind of chaos,

57
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,949
that surrounds the perfection, the solemnity,

58
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,264
the geometry of Christ.

59
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,981
That's right. Christ forms an equilateral triangle,

60
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,544
his head is in the center of a circle;

61
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:08,853
the window that frames his head reads as a halo.

62
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:12,899
There's that calm center, and then human beings,

63
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:16,629
with all of their faults and fears and worries,

64
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,871
around that divine center.

65
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:22,184
This is Leonardo da Vinci, who is thinking about mathematics,

66
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:23,431
he's thinking about science,

67
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:27,238
he's thinking about the integration of all of these things.

68
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:29,251
If we look at earlier images of the Last Supper,

69
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,311
there's lots of room at the table;

70
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:34,655
there's lots of decorations in the room;

71
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:37,478
what Leonardo does is he simplifies everything,

72
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:40,880
and focuses us on those figures and their gestures

73
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,909
and by making it so that there's no room behind the table -

74
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:45,614
the figures take up so much space -

75
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:50,138
it's separating our world from the world of Christ and the apostles.

76
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:52,877
There's no way for us to enter that space.

77
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:55,482
In fact, there's no way for them to move into our space.

78
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:57,768
There really is this demarcation.

79
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:01,256
In versions of the Last Supper that Leonardo would have seen in Florence,

80
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:04,326
Judas is sitting on the opposite side of the table;

81
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:06,969
and by putting Judas with the other apostles,

82
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:12,141
he does use the table as a barrier between our world and the world of the apostles.

83
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:14,710
Let's look at those faces for just a moment.

84
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,200
Christ is so serene, his eyes are down,

85
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,760
one hand is up, one hand is down.

86
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,619
To his right is a group of three.

87
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,710
And there is Judas, who is facing away from us in shadow.

88
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,026
His neck is turned, reminding us that that night he will hang himself.

89
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:35,633
Now as he pulls away, St. Peter, Christ's protector, rushes in.

90
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:39,239
He's got a knife that he holds around his back,

91
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:43,553
and he comes in, seeming to say almost, "Who is it? I need to defend you."

92
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:46,217
The third figure in that group with Judas and Peter

93
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:49,776
would be St. John, who looks very resigned and closes his eyes,

94
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:52,702
and that's the tradition in paintings of the Last Supper.

95
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:56,089
My favorite three figures are the figures on the far right.

96
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,426
Leonardo was very interested in using the body

97
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:03,378
to reveal the soul, to reveal one's internal nature.

98
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:06,774
But Leonardo was creating these four groups of three

99
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:09,561
with that idea of knitting the figures together,

100
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:11,468
overlapping them with one another,

101
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:12,853
creating all this drama.

102
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:18,010
And creating tensions and contrasts between the emotional responses of all these figures.

103
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,309
There's that incredible grouping of Thomas pointing upward -

104
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:25,897
- As if to say, "is this something that is ordained by God?

105
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:28,568
Is this God's plan, that one of us should betray you?"

106
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:33,725
But of course, that finger also foreshadows him actually proving Christ's resurrection

107
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:36,531
by plunging that finger into Christ's wound.

108
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:40,974
And then we have Phillip and James the Major, and they're in opposition,

109
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:44,805
one throwing his arms out, one bringing his hands together.

110
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,350
And if we were to compare this with earlier Last Suppers,

111
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,556
we would see the way that the figures remained very separate from one another.

112
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:55,203
And here that idea of the unified composition,

113
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:57,762
which is so characteristic of the High Renaissance.

114
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:00,647
But what I sense here more than anything

115
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:06,570
is the Divinity of Christ here, in the center, his calm,

116
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,926
the way that all of those perspective lines bring us toward him.

117
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:14,981
It's interesting, because that perspective that the artist is rendering

118
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:17,620
is slightly at odds with the perspective

119
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,376
as we see it from down here on the floor.

120
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:23,219
That is, we would need to be close to Christ's level

121
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:27,240
to see this painting in a perspectivally correct manner.

122
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,804
And it's interesting. In a sense,

123
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:31,557
it elevates us as we look at this painting.

124
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,640
Right. We would have to be what,

125
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,230
about 10 or 15 feet off the floor

126
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,064
to have the perspective work exactly perfectly.

127
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,454
So, we have this divine presence in the center

128
00:06:40,454 --> 00:06:42,978
indicated in all of these different ways.

129
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:47,972
Now keep in mind, we're not seeing this the way that people would have seen it in 1498.

130
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,557
The painting is in terrible condition,

131
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:54,991
in part because Leonardo experimented with a combination of oil paint and tempera

132
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:57,901
in an environment where fresco would be traditionally used,

133
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:01,638
and the painting began to deteriorate soon after it was completed.

134
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,156
Right. Unlike a traditional fresco,

135
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,626
which is painted on wet plaster,

136
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:06,370
Leonardo painted on dry plaster,

137
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,855
and the paint never really adhered to the wall.

138
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:12,106
So, luckily for us, "The Last Supper" has been conserved.

139
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:16,775
And so, in some ways, this is a perfect representation of the High Renaissance.

140
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:20,808
It is finding a way of creating a sense of the eternal,

141
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,586
a sense of the perfect, but within the chaos

142
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:25,801
that is the human experience.

143
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:29,236
That's right. Uniting the earthly and the divine.

144
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:37,970
