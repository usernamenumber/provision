1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,710
We came up with a process for
generating an orthonormal

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,515
basis in the last video, and
it wasn't a new discovery.

4
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:08,650
It's called the Gram-Schmidt
process.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,760
But let's apply that now to
some real examples, and

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,590
hopefully, we'll see that it's
a lot more concrete than it

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,780
might have looked in
the last video.

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:24,040
Let's say I have the plane x1
plus x2 plus x3 is equal to 0.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,200
This is a plane in R3.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,549
So let's just say that subspace
V is equal to the

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:41,370
plane defined by this guy right
here. x1 plus x2 plus x3

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,390
is equal to 0.

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,760
All of the vectors in the
subspace, if you take their

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,190
entries and you add them up,
you're going to get 0.

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,001
So first we need just any basis
for v, so let's see if

16
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,510
we can come up with that.

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,750
So if we subtract x2 and x3
from both sides of this

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,060
equation, we know that x1
is going to be equal to

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,440
minus x2 minus x3.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,680
Or we could say that our
subspace V is equal to the set

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,240
of all of the vectors in R3--
x1, x2 and x3-- that satisfy

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,120
the equation, let's say,
minus-- well, let me

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,700
write it this way.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:26,770
Let's say that x2 is equal to
c1, and x3 is equal to c2.

25
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:33,980
Then this equation would be x1
is equal to minus c1 minus c2.

26
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,980
So if we write it that way, then
the subspace V is a set

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:42,860
of all of the vectors in R3
such that c1 times some

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,700
vector-- let me write it this
way-- c1 times-- let me write

29
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,880
it this way-- plus c2 times some
other vector, where c1

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,530
and c2 are any real numbers,
so c1 and c2 are a

31
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,890
member of the reals.

32
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,600
And so what is x1? x1 is equal
to minus c1 minus c2.

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,139
So x1 is equal to minus
1 c1, minus 1 c2.

34
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,190
x2 is just equal to c1.

35
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,550
So x2 is equal to 1 times
c1 plus 0 times c2.

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,650
And then x3 is equal to c2, or
0 times c1 plus 1 times c2.

37
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,040
So V is essentially the span of
these two vectors, all of

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,940
the linear combinations
of these two vectors.

39
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,520
That would represent
that plane.

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,490
So let me write it like this.

41
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:39,580
So V is equal to the span of the
vectors minus 1, 1, 0, and

42
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,480
the vector minus 1, 0, 1.

43
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,350
And you can see that
these are linearly

44
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,750
independent right here.

45
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,260
Obviously, there's no linear
combination of this guy that

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,090
can give you a 1 over here,
and there's no linear

47
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,290
combination of this
guy that'll give

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,950
you a 1 right there.

49
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,010
So this is what V is.

50
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,920
But what we want, the whole
reason why I'm making this

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,870
video, is to find an orthonormal
basis for V.

52
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,990
This is just a basis.

53
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,040
These guys right here are
just a basis for V.

54
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,480
Let's find an orthonormal
basis.

55
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,860
Let's call this vector up here,
let's call that v1, and

56
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,370
let's call this vector
right here v2.

57
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,480
So if we wanted to find an
orthonormal basis for the span

58
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,520
of v1-- let me write
this down.

59
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,150
Let me define some subspace V1
is equal to the span of just

60
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,910
my vector v1.

61
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,740
Well, we saw in the last video,
if we just divide v1 by

62
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,640
its length, then the span of
that vector is going to be a

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,280
unit vector, and it's going to
be the same thing as the

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,050
subspace V1.

65
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,970
It's this line in R3.

66
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,660
So let's do that.

67
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,110
What is the length of v1?

68
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:55,870
The length of v1 is equal to
the square root of minus 1

69
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,030
squared, which is 1, plus 1
squared, which is 1, plus 0

70
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,650
squared, which is 0, so it's
equal to the square root of 2.

71
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:10,030
So let's define some vector u1
is equal to 1 divided by the

72
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,010
length of v1, so 1 over the
square root of 2 times v1,

73
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,720
times minus 1, 1, 0.

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,029
Then the span of v1 is
just the same thing

75
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,530
as the span of u1.

76
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,620
And so this would be an
orthonormal basis.

77
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,930
Just this vector right here
would be an orthonormal basis

78
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,600
for just the span of v1.

79
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,880
But we don't want just the span
of v1, we want the span

80
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,910
of v1 and v2.

81
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,230
Let me just draw it.

82
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,210
So right now, we have a basis,
if I just do u1.

83
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,690
I'm not going to actually draw
what this looks like.

84
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,900
Maybe it looks something like
this, and its span is this

85
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,150
entire line in R3.

86
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,160
   

87
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,860
The span of just one vector in
Rn is just going to be all the

88
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,600
scalar multiples of it
or a line in Rn.

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,310
So this right here is
the subspace V1.

90
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,700
Now, we have a v2 here, which
is linearly independent from

91
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,690
this guy, which means it's
linearly independent from this

92
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,360
guy, because he's just a scaled
version of this guy.

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,480
So v2 is going to
look like that.

94
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,510
That is v2 right there.

95
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,070
This, of course, was our u1.

96
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,350
And what we want to do is we
want to find a subspace V.

97
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,690
I'll call it V2 for now.

98
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:31,530
V2 is equal to the span of v1
and v2, which is the same

99
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,720
thing as the span-- anything
that's spanned by v1 is also

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,860
spanned by u1-- the
span of u1 and v2.

101
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,090
So we want to see everything
that could be generated by

102
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,480
linear combinations
of u1 and v2.

103
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,300
And obviously, this thing right
here is our plane that

104
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:48,930
we're talking about.

105
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,330
The span of these two guys,
that is the whole subspace

106
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,540
that we're talking about
in this problem.

107
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,630
So that is equal to V.

108
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,550
So once we find this, if we find
an orthonormal version

109
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,215
for this span, we're done.

110
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,900
So how can we do that?

111
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,140
Well, if I can find a vector
that's orthogonal to all of

112
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,380
the linear combinations of this,
that if I add up some

113
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,040
linear combination of this to
that vector, I can get v2, I

114
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,480
can replace v2 with
that vector.

115
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,890
So we can call that vector
right there y2, right?

116
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,680
If I can determine a y2, this
y2 is clearly orthogonal to

117
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,490
everything over here, and I can
take some vector in v1, in

118
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,220
this line, and add it to y2,
and I can get to v2.

119
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,390
So combinations of these guys
are just as good as v2.

120
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:41,180
So this is going to be equal
to the span of u1 and y2.

121
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,330
Now what is y2 equal to?

122
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,930
Well, we saw in the last
video, this is just a

123
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,630
projection of v2.

124
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,640
This vector right here is the
projection of v2 onto the

125
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,370
subspace V1.

126
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,870
And how do we figure out
what that-- and then

127
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,910
what would y2 be?

128
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,110
y2 would be v2 minus that.

129
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:06,840
So y2 is equal to v2 minus the
projection of v2 onto v1.

130
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,430
Or if, we were to actually write
it out, what is that

131
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,060
going to be equal to?

132
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,870
So it's going to be equal to--
v2 is this vector right here.

133
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,050
So it's minus 1, 0, 2.

134
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,370
That is v2.

135
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,820
v2 minus the projection
of v2 onto v1.

136
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,190
Well the projection of the
vector v2 onto the subspace V1

137
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:35,780
is just v2, minus 1, 0, 0,
dotted with the orthonormal

138
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,690
basis for v1.

139
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,655
The orthonormal basis
for v1 is just u1.

140
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:43,620
And we solved for u1 up here,
so that's going to be that

141
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,890
dotted with 1 over the square
root of 2 times-- let me do

142
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,450
that in yellow, actually,
just so you can see

143
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,490
that this is u1.

144
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,690
So dotting it with u1, so
dotting it with 1 over the

145
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,780
square root of 2 times minus 1,
1, 0-- I like leaving the 1

146
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,670
over the square root of 2 out of
there, just to keep things

147
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,960
simple-- all of that divided
by-- actually,

148
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,720
not divided by anything.

149
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,680
Because we if we were doing a
projection of a line, it would

150
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,080
be divided by the dot product of
the orthonormal basis with

151
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,360
itself, but its length is 1, so
we don't have that, and we

152
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,150
saw that before.

153
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,310
Actually let me-- let me write
this a little bit.

154
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,700
I'll just move it down.

155
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,630
Let me see if I can move it.

156
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,370
It's just equal to
that guy, right?

157
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,850
Let me make the numbers clear.

158
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:39,130
This is v2 minus the projection
of v2 onto the

159
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,880
subspace 1.

160
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,840
So that's just v2 dotted with
my orthonormal basis for v1,

161
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,680
my first vector in my
orthonormal basis.

162
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,830
There's only one, so I'm only
going to have one term here,

163
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,960
and then all of that times
my orthonormal

164
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,950
basis vector for v1.

165
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,050
So 1 over the square
root of 2 times the

166
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,070
vector minus 1, 1, 0.

167
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,860
Now this looks really fancy.

168
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,420
This right here is our
orthonormal basis for the

169
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,020
subspace V1, but what does
this simplify to?

170
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,450
So this is going to be equal
to-- remember, this right

171
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,120
here, this piece right
there, that's the

172
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,970
projection onto v1 of v2.

173
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,230
That's what that was
right there.

174
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,880
So this is going to be equal to
the vector minus 1, 0, 1,

175
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,140
minus-- now, I can take the 1
over the square root of 2 on

176
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,620
the outside.

177
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,470
Actually, I can take both of
these onto the outside.

178
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,385
So 1 over the square root of 2
times 1 over the square root

179
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:41,670
of 2, it's just going to
be 1 over 2, right?

180
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:47,270
So this is going to be minus
1/2 times these guys dotted

181
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,580
with each other.

182
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,430
Let me just write it this way.

183
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,600
So what is these guys dotted
with each other?

184
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,070
It's just going to
be a number.

185
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,760
Minus 1 times minus 1 is 1,
plus 0 times 1, so plus 0,

186
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,440
plus 1 times 0, so plus 0.

187
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,440
All of that times-- well, we
already used this part of it,

188
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,810
so we just have this part
left over-- times minus

189
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,700
1, 1, and the 0.

190
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,420
This was the dot product, and
we took the two scaling

191
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,110
factors out.

192
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,830
When you multiply them you got
1/2, so this is just going to

193
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,440
be a 1, which simplifies
things.

194
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,680
So this is going to be equal to
the vector minus 1, 0, 1,

195
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,350
minus 1/2 times this, or we
could just write-- 1/2 times

196
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,150
minus 1 is minus 1/2.

197
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,190
We have 1/2 and then
we have 0.

198
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,120
And so this is going to
be equal to minus

199
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,010
1, minus minus 1/2.

200
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,220
That's plus 1/2, so that's going
to be just minus 1/2.

201
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,050
0 minus 1/2 is minus 1/2.

202
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,120
And then 1 minus 0 is just 1.

203
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,790
So this right here
is our vector y2.

204
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,610
   

205
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,320
And if you combined u1 right
here and y2, we are spanning

206
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,930
our subspace V.

207
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,000
But we don't have an orthonormal
basis yet.

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,490
These guys are orthogonal with
respect to each other, but

209
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,840
this guy does not have
length 1 yet.

210
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,500
So to make it equal to length
1, let's replace him.

211
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,700
Let's define another vector u2
that's equal to 1 over the

212
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:29,820
length of y2 times y2.

213
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,320
So what is the length of y2?

214
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:38,290
The length of y2 is equal to the
square root of minus 1/2

215
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:45,160
squared is 1/4, plus
1 squared.

216
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,930
So it's the square root
of 1 and 1/2, or 3/2.

217
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,060
So it's equal to the square
root of 3/2, right?

218
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,250
Yeah, this is 1/2 plus 1 is
1 and 1/2, which is 3/2.

219
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,080
So it's equal to the
square root of 3/2.

220
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,806
So if I defined u2, u2 is equal
to 1 over the square

221
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:11,120
root of 3/2, or that's the same
thing as the square root

222
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,060
of 2/3 times y2, which is this
guy right here, minus 1/2,

223
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,470
minus 1/2, and 1.

224
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,420
And I already had defined
u1 up here.

225
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,680
u1 was right up here.

226
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,540
Let me copy and paste.

227
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,180
Actually, I think I can
just move it down.

228
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,600
   

229
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,140
So I found u1 right here.

230
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:44,930
We now have two vectors that are
orthogonal with respect to

231
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,950
each other.

232
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,870
So if I have the set of
u1 and u2, these guys

233
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,410
both have length 1.

234
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,620
They are orthogonal with respect
to each other, and

235
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,410
they span V.

236
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:03,030
So this is an orthonormal basis
for the plane that we

237
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,340
started this video
out with: for V.

238
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,030
And we're done.

239
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,650
We have done the Gram-Schmidt
process.

240
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,390
These are our new orthonormal
basis vectors.

241
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:13,626
