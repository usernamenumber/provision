1
00:00:00,976 --> 00:00:04,304
So we have a function f(x) graphed right over here

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:08,901
then we have a bunch of statements about the limit of f(x) as x approaches different values

3
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:11,753
and what I want to do is to figure out which of these statements are true

4
00:00:11,784 --> 00:00:13,971
and which of these are false

5
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:18,824
So let's look at this first statement: limit of f(x) as x approaches

6
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:23,563
one from the positive direction is equal to zero

7
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:26,303
So Is this true or false?

8
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:30,922
So let's look at it. So we're talking about as x approaches one

9
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:35,139
from the positive direction, so for values greater than one

10
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:39,528
So as x approaches one from the positive direction what is f(x)?

11
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:41,535
Well, when x is let's say one and a half

12
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:47,340
f(x) is up here; as x gets closer and closer to one, f(x) stays right at one

13
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:49,904
So as x approaches one

14
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:54,221
from the positive direction it looks like the limit of f...

15
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,784
...it looks like the limit of f(x) as x approaches one from the positive direction

16
00:00:57,784 --> 00:01:00,571
isn't zero - It looks like it is one

17
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:04,370
So this is not, this is not true.

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:10,704
This would be true if instead of saying from the positive direction, we said from the negative direction: from the negative direction the function really does look like look like it is...

19
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:15,451
...the value of the function really does look like look like it is approaching zero

20
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:21,263
For approaching one from the negative direction, when x is right over here, this is f(x)...

21
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:23,393
...when x is right over here, this is f(x)...

22
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:26,368
...when x is right over here, this is f(x)

23
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:29,587
and we see that the value of f(x) seems to get closer and closer to zero

24
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:33,035
So this would only be true if we were approaching from the negative direction

25
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:36,787
Next question: limit of f(x) as x approaches zero from the

26
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:40,503
negative direction is the same as limit of f(x) as x approaches zero

27
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:43,205
from the positive direction. Is this statement true?

28
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:48,286
Well, let's look: our function f(x) as we approach zero from the

29
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:52,703
negative direction - I'm using a new color - as we approach zero from the negative direction

30
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:57,704
So, right over here, this is our value of f(x)

31
00:01:57,723 --> 00:02:09,035
then as we get closer, this is our value of f(x), as we get even closer, this is our value of f(x). So it seems from the negative direction like it is approaching positive one; from the positive direction

32
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:13,035
when x is greater than zero: let's try it out

33
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:16,011
So if let's say x is one half, this is our f(x)

34
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,544
if x is let's say one fourth, this is our f(x)

35
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:22,943
If x is just barely larger than zero, this is our f(x)

36
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:28,702
So it also seems to be approaching f(x)...f(x) is equal to one.

37
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:33,454
So this looks true: they both seems to be approaching a limit of one

38
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:37,237
The limit here is one, so this is absolutely true

39
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:44,124
Now let's look at this statement: the limit of f(x) as x approaches zero from the negative direction is equal to one

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,052
Well we've already thought about that

41
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,971
The limit of f(x) as x approaches from the negative direction...

42
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:56,970
...the limit of f(x) as x approaches zero from the negative direction, we see that we are getting closer and closer to one; as x gets closer and closer to zero

43
00:02:57,046 --> 00:03:00,739
f(x) gets closer and closer to one, so this is also true

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,406
Limit of f(x) as x approaches zero exists

45
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:08,662
Well, it definitely exists - we've already established that it's equal to one

46
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,152
so that's true

47
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:15,122
Now, the limit of f(x), as x approaches one, exists - is that true?

48
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:19,986
Well, we already saw that when we were approaching one from the positive direction

49
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:22,600
the limit seems to be approaching one

50
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:28,142
we get when x is a half we get f(x) is one, when x is a little bit more than one, it's one

51
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,157
so it seems like we're getting closer and closer to one

52
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,170
(Just let me write that down)

53
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:38,208
The limit of f(x) as x approaches one from the positive direction is equal to one

54
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:40,415
And now what's the limit...

55
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,026
...the limit of f(x) as x approaches one from the negative direction?

56
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:48,375
Well, here, this is our f(x)...

57
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,828
Here, this is our f(x)...

58
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:55,743
It seems like our f(x) is getting closer and closer to zero when we approach one from values less than one

59
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:57,750
So over here it equals zero

60
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,643
So if the limit from the right-hand side is a different value

61
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:05,292
than the limit from the left-hand side then the limit does not exist

62
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:10,067
So this is not true

63
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:14,301
Now finally, the limit of f(x) as x approaches 1.5 is equal to one

64
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,231
So, right over here

65
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:19,974
So, everything we've been dealing with so far, we've always looked at points of discontinuity

66
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:22,929
or points where maybe the function isn't quite defined

67
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:27,396
but here this is kind of a plain vanilla point; when x is equal to 1.5 that's maybe right over here

68
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:31,207
This is f(1.5); that right over there is the point...

69
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,345
Well, this is the value f(1.5)

70
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:34,629
We could say f of...

71
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:39,622
We could see that f(1.5) is equal to one

72
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:43,267
This right here is the point (1.5, 1)

73
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:47,935
and if we approach it from the left-hand side, from values less than it

74
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,328
it's one, the limit seems to be one

75
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:52,796
and if we approach from the right-hand side the limit seems to be one

76
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:54,572
So this is a pretty straightforward thing

77
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:56,502
The graph is continuous right there

78
00:04:56,502 --> 00:05:00,150
and so really if we just substitute at that point or we just look at the graph

79
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,587
the limit is the value of the function there

80
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:06,429
You don't have to have a function be undefined in order to find a limit there

81
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:14,992
So it is indeed the case that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 1.5 is equal to one
