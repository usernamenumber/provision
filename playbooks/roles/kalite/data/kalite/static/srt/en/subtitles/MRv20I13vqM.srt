1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,533
In the years during the First World War,

2
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:10,000
this art movement called 'Dada' began.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,133
How do you spell that?

4
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,838
That is D-a-d-a.

5
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:18,439
It is really a nonsense word.

6
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,271
The idea was to create a kind of anti-art.

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,943
To kind of challenge what art was.

8
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:24,967
The world was in flames,

9
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:26,937
the war was raging across Europe

10
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,770
and artists didn't want to have any part of it.

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,603
They wanted to show how absurd and how dangerous

12
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:33,900
the world had gotten.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,271
And one of the artists who was a Dada artist

14
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,943
His name was Marcel Duchamp.

15
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:40,333
He had to create what we call 'Ready-Mades'

16
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,937
or what he called Ready-Mades.

17
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:44,033
Some of them were 'Assisted Ready-Mades'

18
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,767
where he would take two objects that existed in the world

19
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:48,233
and put them together,

20
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,733
and some objects were just pure Ready-Mades.

21
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:53,433
And one of my favorites is called

22
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:55,567
"In Advance of a Broken Arm"

23
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:58,934
and we're looking at it on the left here.

24
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,633
And you had to explicitly tell me

25
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:02,067
that it was the one on the left.

26
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:03,439
Yes I did! (he laughs)

27
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,867
So, just to make this clear, this is

28
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:07,000
In Advance of a Broken Arm.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,500
That's exactly right.

30
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,633
And you had to point that out

31
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,300
because we have a very similar piece

32
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,500
on the right side here

33
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,067
which I just got off of Amazon,

34
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,800
which is a snow shovel.

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,600
- And really they're not much different at all, are they?

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,500
No, they both seem like snow shovels.

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,033
They are both snow shovels,

38
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:26,101
except Duchamp has taken his out of the garage

39
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:28,609
or out of the hardware store

40
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,867
and relocated it, sort of reframed it

41
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:33,764
and said, "No, this is a Ready-Made."...

42
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:35,800
..." This is something to look at..."

43
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,900
"...and understand within an aesthetic sphere."

44
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,233
I'm thinking what I think many people are thinking,

45
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:43,098
Okay, he did that, and it seems

46
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:45,133
like what he did was a very cynical act.

47
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:49,067
Which was, like, "here's art for you, all you jokers!"

48
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,867
"I'm going to go buy a snow shovel..."

49
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:54,367
"...and stick it in a museum and --"

50
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:56,633
I don't know, I feel like he's like laughing at people.

51
00:01:56,633 --> 00:02:00,233
I think that there is definitely cynicism here,

52
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,133
and I think that this is

53
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,933
very much related to the objectives of Dada

54
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:09,105
which was to undermine the way in which we valued art,

55
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:10,867
the way in which we understood art,

56
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:13,935
saying that the world had become a place of chaos

57
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,000
and a kind of dangerous chaos, and

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,067
the artist wanted in some ways

59
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:20,200
have nothing to do with that any longer.

60
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,367
So how can I most undermine

61
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,500
and in a sense destroy the way

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,300
in which we had defined art?

63
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,400
To create a kind of anti-art?

64
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,133
I think that's exactly right.

65
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,767
And was he like the first person?

66
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:33,467
Because you know we just talked about Warhol,

67
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:37,200
and we said, if now someone took a piece of advertising

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,300
and stuck it in a museum

69
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,500
it would feel very derivative,

70
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,733
but Warhol did that a while after Duchamp.

71
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:42,733
So to some degree

72
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,433
it feels like now Warhal is derivative,

73
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:45,607
because Duchamp, --

74
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:47,929
you know, Warhol had to actually do some work,

75
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,633
he like actually painted a soup can,

76
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:53,278
but this guy, I mean, he's way ahead of his time,

77
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:55,900
he literally just bought a snow shovel

78
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,867
and showed up.

79
00:02:57,867 --> 00:02:59,867
Duchamp would say however,

80
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,266
that finding a perfect Ready-Made

81
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,599
wasn't an easy thing.

82
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,733
He went on a hunt

83
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:07,039
and most objects did not suit his definition

84
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,832
of what a perfect Ready-Made would be.

85
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:12,300
You know he has created a kind of narrative here.

86
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,666
I mean, what do you think of

87
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,633
when you put that snow shovel together with the title?

88
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:21,366
To me, it looks like a parody.

89
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:25,133
In Advance of a Broken Arm...

90
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:27,366
Yeah, he went and bought a snow shovel

91
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:29,933
and he called it In Advance of a Broken Arm,

92
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,933
which is a very, kind of fancy-sounding title,

93
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,332
which makes you think a little bit,

94
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:38,033
but yeah, I , er, yeah

95
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,266
(they giggle)

96
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:41,467
So I think you're absolutely right,

97
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:42,704
I think it's impossible,

98
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:44,499
And here's the even more absurd part:

99
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:45,933
we're looking at a photograph,

100
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:48,067
not even of the original In Advance of a Broken Arm,

101
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,300
but a later snow shovel

102
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,166
he replaced the original with

103
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,832
after the first had been lost,

104
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,300
perhaps to a snow storm!

105
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
O yeah here we read:

106
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,832
"August 1964,"

107
00:03:57,832 --> 00:04:02,022
"Fourth version after lost original of November 1915"

108
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:04,133
So I guess --

109
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,532
Well, can you even have an original?

110
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:07,400
Well exactly, because there's probably

111
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,832
a hundred of those originals.

112
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,332
So, let's play this out for a moment.

113
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:13,099
Imagine that this came up to auction

114
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,767
and it went to Sotheby's or Christie's,

115
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,633
it went to one of the big auction houses

116
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,800
and it's a Duchamp,

117
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,066
this important example of Dada.

118
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:22,967
And the auction is going to start

119
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:25,267
at some very high numbers right?

120
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,100
It's going to start at 2 million dollars.

121
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,800
Is that really what this might go for?

122
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,100
Er, these are priceless objects.

123
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,566
Except that somebody could walk into Home Depot

124
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,767
or go onto Amazon

125
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:40,032
or in their grandfather's barn or something

126
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:41,400
And imagine they could get

127
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,467
past the guard at Christie's

128
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:43,999
and walk into the showroom

129
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:45,600
with their own snow shovel

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,133
and there would be no difference, physically,

131
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,333
between the snow shovel

132
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,667
that is up on the podium

133
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,499
that is for sale, for auction,

134
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:54,566
and that is reaching this astronomical figure

135
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:55,708
versus the snow shovel

136
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,733
that's worth 29,99.

137
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,900
So that's a fascinating question,

138
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,566
because they are physically identical snow shovels

139
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:05,532
and one was touched by Duchamp

140
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:07,932
and placed in a museum

141
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,532
and another 1,000 were not

142
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:11,467
and because of that,

143
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:14,432
this one could go for millions.

144
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:15,532
You started off by saying

145
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:16,733
"is Duchamp being cynical"?

146
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,371
I think in some ways he really is.

147
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:20,042
He is trying to make, in a sense,

148
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:22,532
the apparatus of the art market transparent,

149
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:25,167
he is trying to force us to grapple with

150
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,967
"how do we define what art is?"

151
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,233
and how it's important.

152
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,633
And maybe that our values are misplaced

153
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:31,633
in some way.

154
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,100
But he is also pointing toward something else

155
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,532
which is that art is not necessarily

156
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,300
in the 20th century,

157
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,233
located in the practice of its making,

158
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:41,999
located in the proficiency of the artist

159
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,566
and their brush work,

160
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:46,667
but it is located in the symbolic language

161
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,200
that art can invoke.

162
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,267
In the way that art

163
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,467
can transform the way

164
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:51,733
that we see the world.

165
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:52,833
So...

166
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,362
I am actually becoming a bit of a fan

167
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:55,300
of Duchamp.

168
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,467
But I think there is...

169
00:05:57,467 --> 00:06:00,900
O and I'm also thinking of becoming

170
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,696
an avant-garde artist.

171
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,690
I want to do an art installation

172
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,566
called "Breath Of Air".

173
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:12,066
Which is: I will go to that location

174
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,733
that little part of volume

175
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:16,233
and I will just exhale, right there.

176
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,467
And I will put a little plaque or something

177
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,267
saying "Salman has exhaled at this point"

178
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:21,633
That would push thinking at art.

179
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:23,733
Art that doesn't even exist!

180
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,523
You know what?

181
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:27,767
You missed your moment.

182
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:29,467
Because art was made like that

183
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:30,932
in the 1970's and 80's.

184
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,967
Someone has allready done that?

185
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:34,900
Someone has allready created art that doesn't exist?

186
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,767
- Or, art that exists as a performative act.

187
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,532
O, yeah, but...

188
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,100
yeah.

189
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,333
This is a difficult one.

190
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,999
I'm er,

191
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,133
I mean...

192
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,733
yeah.

193
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:48,967
(they laugh)

194
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,400
This is about as tough as it gets.

195
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,267
What is your take on it?

196
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:54,333
I mean, In Advance of a Broken Arm.

197
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,600
It does...

198
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,733
I, I agree with everything you said

199
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:59,833
that, like, he introduced this,

200
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,733
he is challenging people's notion of art,

201
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:02,900
challenging the art market,

202
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,967
challenging all of these

203
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:05,368
but in my mind it seems

204
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:06,529
in a very cynical way.

205
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,967
That 'I'm going to put a very mundane object on there,

206
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,400
make people bid on it

207
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,700
and think of it as art,

208
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,667
but...

209
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,267
What do you make of this name

210
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,900
"Advance of a Broken Arm"?

211
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,535
And that it gets a special showcase

212
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:18,833
and the fact that it costs the same

213
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:23,000
as a 5 dollar snow shovel from Home Depot?

214
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,867
You know, when we think about poetry for example

215
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:29,233
we don't worry about the cost of the typeface

216
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,400
we think about

217
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,861
where that poetry brings us

218
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:34,833
emotionally and intellectually.

219
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,700
It transforms us, it changes us.

220
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,667
And so, it is interesting that in the visual arts

221
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,433
we are still so tied to the handicraft.

222
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:44,566
Duchamp is really distancing art

223
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:45,833
from the handicraft

224
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,700
and making it a purely conceptual process.

225
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,433
So he is really forcing that issue

226
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,967
I think in an important way.

227
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,133
That has really challenged the 20th century

228
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:58,066
and made contemporary art possible.

229
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,933
That is interesting

230
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:00,864
So what you are saying is that

231
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,667
he is -- like poetry

232
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,032
Poetry is really about the idea of poetry

233
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:05,500
someone can copy and paste that

234
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,167
and we can all share that poetry

235
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,000
there is no physical words there

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,200
And he kind of did the same

237
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,367
It's the idea

238
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,833
thats why he was able to take another shovel

239
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,167
and do it again and again.

240
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,000
But still... We say that but

241
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,867
at the same time, the art market

242
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:21,333
does not necessarily view it that way.

243
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,333
They view this shovel as somehow being holy

244
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,367
versus the other shovel

245
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,032
that was made at the same assembly line

246
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:28,667
that is nowhere near as holy.

247
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:29,833
I think that is exactly right

248
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,799
and in some ways, Duchamp failed.

249
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,499
In some ways, I think the avarice

250
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:35,369
of the art market has prevailed

251
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:37,876
despite his attempt to undermine it.

252
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:40,233
We still would auction it at a very high price

253
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,799
we still differentiate the 2 shovels

254
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,467
and we would still value one

255
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:45,500
over the other

256
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,267
In a sence we heroicise the object

257
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:48,500
that is somehow connected

258
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,767
to the conceptual

259
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,067
even though I think Duchamp

260
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:52,833
was really focussed on

261
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,874
seperating those things.

262
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:56,035
And what about--

263
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,400
just going back to the name

264
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,233
I mean I can kind of buy

265
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,299
some of this

266
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,500
in that he is challenging what is art

267
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,633
and this idea

268
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,233
of putting focus on something like this,

269
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,876
but at the same time it seems like

270
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:11,267
the title is a little bit uppity.

271
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,200
Why didn't he just call it 'Snow Shovel'?

272
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,539
Or just 'blank'?

273
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:16,700
Why did he have to say

274
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,000
"In Advance of a Broken Arm"?

275
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,533
I will not pretend to know

276
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:20,767
what his motivations were

277
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,876
but I think that the cynicism we spoke of before

278
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,799
is exactly his point here.

279
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,033
Some of my students have said

280
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,799
they can imagine someone slipped on the ice

281
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,133
and broke their arm.

282
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,033
Oh, I could imagine,

283
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:35,462
you could call this 'In Advance of a Cherry Pie"

284
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:38,067
I can imagine that after working a long day

285
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,299
shoveling snow I will go eat a cherry pie.

286
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:45,633
I think that notion of absurdity

287
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,866
was central to Duchamp's practice

288
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,500
and what he was interested in.

289
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,900
I think he wanted us to bump up against

290
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,866
the absurdity of that title

291
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,667
and to be challenged by it.

292
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:56,871
Fascinating.
