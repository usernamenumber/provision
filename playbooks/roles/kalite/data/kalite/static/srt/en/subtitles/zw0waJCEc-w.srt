1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
   

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,700
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,380
I'm now going to do a proof
of a trig identity, which

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,520
I think is pretty amazing.

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,660
Although, I think, the
proof isn't that obvious.

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,250
And I'll have to admit ahead of
time, this isn't something that

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,070
would have occurred
to me naturally.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,802
I wouldn't have naturally
drawn this figure just

9
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:20,010
to start off with.

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,740
Let's just say we want to
figure out some other way to

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:33,440
write the sine of alpha plus
beta, where alpha and beta are

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,580
let's say, two separate angles.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:42,180
So if I had the sine of 40 and
50 degrees, I'd want to know--

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,140
this would obviously be the
sine of 90, which is easy.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,040
But could I rewrite that as
some combination of the sine

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,280
of 40 and the sine
of 50 or whatever?

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,040
I think you'll see
where this is going.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,790
So let's go back to this
diagram and let's say

19
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,040
that this-- let me
pick a better color.

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,710
Let's say that this is angle
alpha and this is angle beta.

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,240
   

22
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:12,020
Than this whole angle right
here is angle alpha plus beta.

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,970
So we want to figure out the
sine of alpha plus beta.

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,810
Well, the sine of alpha plus
beta, the sine of this

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,120
whole angle, opposite
over hypotenuse.

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,440
Opposite this whole angle is if
we use this right angle-- or

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,830
this right triangle,
triangle BAC.

28
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:33,262
Opposite is BC, so
that equals BC.

29
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:35,170
I'll draw a little
line over it.

30
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,790
BC over the hypotenuse, AB.

31
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,520
   

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,650
BC over AB is the sine
of alpha plus beta.

33
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,770
Well, can be write BC
over AB differently?

34
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,900
Let's see if we can.

35
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,920
And probably, the person who
first figured out this proof

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,440
was just playing around.

37
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,090
They drew this diagram,
they said, can I write

38
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,480
BC any differently?

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,730
Well BC-- this whole length--
is the sum of BD and EF.

40
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,070
And we know that because this
is a horizontal line right now

41
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,620
and you can figure that out
just by looking at all

42
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,750
the right angles.

43
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,800
But this is a horizontal line.

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,970
So BC is the same
thing is BD plus EF.

45
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,880
Let's write that one down.

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:30,750
BC is the same thing
as BD plus EF.

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,050
   

48
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,290
And then still, all
of that, over AB.

49
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,730
All I did is I rewrote BC as a
sum of this segment and this

50
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,700
segment, which should make
sense to you, hopefully.

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:52,970
And then we can of course,
rewrite that as equal to BD

52
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:05,460
over AB plus EF over AB.

53
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:13,060
So BD over AB plus EF over AB.

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,020
And these are kind of
nonsensical ratios, right?

55
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,920
BD over AB, what can
I do with that?

56
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,420
And EF over AB, what
can I do with that?

57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,190
Wouldn't it be more interesting
if I could do like BD over BE.

58
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,520
That'd be an interesting ratio
because that would be a

59
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,500
segment over its hypotenuse.

60
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,400
So let's see if we can rewrite
it somehow like that.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,610
Well, we could just do
it mathematically.

62
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:52,900
We could say this is equal to
BD over BE times BE over AB.

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,560
So this might seem
non-intuitive to you, but

64
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,820
it kind of makes sense.

65
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,505
We didn't pick BE
completely arbitrarily.

66
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:01,750
We said we know what BD is, so
let me pick another side that I

67
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,130
can do something maybe
with real trig ratios.

68
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,330
And so I said BD over
BE times BE over AB is

69
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,380
equal to BD over AB.

70
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,190
I hope I don't confuse you
with all these letters.

71
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,210
But that makes sense, right?

72
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,850
Because these two terms
would just cancel out.

73
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,430
If we're just multiplying these
fractions then you would

74
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,770
get back to this top term.

75
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,090
Let me actually make sure
that you understand

76
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,240
that this-- whoops.

77
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,630
That this term and this
term are the same thing.

78
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,810
And now let's do
that second term.

79
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,960
We know EF, wouldn't it be good
if we could relate EF to

80
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,570
something, like it's the
hypotenuse of this

81
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,280
right triangle?

82
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,220
Like AE.

83
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,075
So let's do that.

84
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:42,810
   

85
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,750
So let's put the
plus sign there.

86
00:04:44,750 --> 00:05:01,450
EF over AB is the same thing as
EF over AE times AE over AB.

87
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,480
Once again, we're just
multiplying fractions.

88
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,170
These would cancel out and
you would get this again.

89
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,760
Let me make sure you understand
that this term is the

90
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,660
same thing as this term.

91
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,560
And you can just multiple out
the fractions and that's

92
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,570
what you would get.

93
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,920
Now before we progress
with this whole line of

94
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,900
thought that we're doing.

95
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,860
Let's see if we could figure
out something else interesting

96
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,990
about this strange set of
triangles and shapes

97
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,850
that I've drawn.

98
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,060
It's actually pretty neat.

99
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,390
IF this angle is alpha--
we have line AF.

100
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,800
EF is perpendicular
to it, right?

101
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,450
And DE is perpendicular
to EF, right?

102
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,260
So DE, this line, and
AF are parallel.

103
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,110
Since AF is parallel to DE and
then, AE intersects both,

104
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,350
we know that, what is that?

105
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,460
The inner angles?

106
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,780
Yeah, I think that's
called inner angles

107
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,730
with parallel lines.

108
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,080
That this is also
equal to alpha.

109
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,330
You can imagine long parallel
line here, long parallel here,

110
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,890
and then this line
intersects both.

111
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,500
So if this is a little
confusing maybe you want to

112
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,880
review a little bit of the
parallel line geometry, but I

113
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,150
think this might make sense.

114
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,380
So if this angle is alpha,
then this angle right here

115
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,300
is complementary to it.

116
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,740
So it's 90 minus alpha.

117
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,470
   

118
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,600
And if this angle is
90 minus alpha, this

119
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,480
angle is obviously 90.

120
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,210
Then we know that this angle
plus this angle plus this

121
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,460
angle has to equal 180.

122
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,620
So we know that this
is equal to alpha.

123
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,980
If that doesn't make sense to
you, think about this: alpha

124
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,070
plus 90 minus alpha plus
90-- that's a minus.

125
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,370
Minus alpha.

126
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,120
Plus 90 is what?

127
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,760
Alpha plus 90 minus alpha.

128
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,920
So this minus alpha and alpha
cancel out and you just have 90

129
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,080
plus 90 and that equals 180.

130
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,775
So we know that this angle
right here, I know it's

131
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:57,980
getting really small and
probably hard to read.

132
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,940
We know that this
angle here is alpha.

133
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,730
So let's get back to what
we were progressing,

134
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,060
what we were doing here.

135
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,190
So what is BD over BE?

136
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,850
BD over BE.

137
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,990
Well, that's the adjacent
to this alpha, which is

138
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,690
the same angle really.

139
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:23,530
BD over BE, so it's
adjacent over hypotenuse.

140
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,630
Cosine.

141
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,780
So that is equal to
the cosine of alpha.

142
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,880
   

143
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,360
And what's BE over AB?

144
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,900
   

145
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,770
Well, if we look at this larger
right triangle, that is the

146
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,230
opposite of beta times
its hypotenuse.

147
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,620
So what's opposite
over hypotenuse?

148
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,740
SOH.

149
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,710
S O H.

150
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,480
Sine.

151
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,000
So sine of beta is BE over AB.

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,310
So this is sine of beta.

153
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:06,940
   

154
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,780
And now let me
switch to magenta.

155
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,610
What's EF over AE?

156
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,210
   

157
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,960
If we look at this right
triangle right here,

158
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,220
is opposite over
hypotenuse for alpha.

159
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,050
So it's sine of alpha.

160
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,030
Opposite over hypotenuse.

161
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,000
   

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,660
And what's AE over AB?

163
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,240
   

164
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,330
So now we're looking at this
large right triangle here.

165
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,780
AE over AB.

166
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,710
Well, that's the adjacent of
beta over the hypotenuse.

167
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,580
Well, what's adjacent
over hypotenuse?

168
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,430
That's the cosine.

169
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,230
CAH.

170
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,140
Cosine of beta, of
this beta right here.

171
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,650
I think we're done.

172
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,140
This is to me, fairly
mind blowing.

173
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:14,010
That the sine of alpha plus
beta is equal to the cosine of

174
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,920
alpha times the sine of beta.

175
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,310
Plus the sine of alpha
times the cosine of beta.

176
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,590
What's neat about this is that
it kind of came out of this

177
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,970
nice symmetric formula.

178
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,370
It's not this big, hairy thing.

179
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,530
You might have even guessed it.

180
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,940
I don't know.

181
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,950
I just find it very neat.

182
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,430
We went through this big
convoluted proof with this big

183
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,780
convoluted shape, but we got
this nice symmetric trig

184
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,980
identity out of it.

185
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,780
So hopefully you found that
amazing as well and in the next

186
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,900
presentation I'll do a proof
for cosine of alpha plus beta.

187
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,460
See you soon.

188
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:47,900
