1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,030
In the last video, we had a ten kilogram mass

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,640
sitting on top of an inclined plane at a 30 degree angle

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,220
And in order to figure out what would happen to this block

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,020
we broke down the force of gravity on this block into

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,860
the components that are parallel to the surface of the plane

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,010
and perpendicular to the surface of the plane

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:29,200
and for a perpendicular component, we got 49 times the square root of 3 N downwards

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,950
That's 98 times this quantity over here, downwards

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,850
But we said look! We don't see this block of ice accelerating downwards into this wedge

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,630
because the wedge is supporting it

11
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,540
So there must be a counteracting force that the wedge is exerting on the block

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,990
And that counteracting force is the normal force of the wedge on the block of ice

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,450
And that is exactly opposite to the force of gravity in this direction

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,240
The normal force of gravity is the normal force of the wedge

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,690
And these completely balance each other out in that normal, perpendicular direction

16
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,620
And that is why this block is not accelerating either in that direction

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,220
or in this direction over here

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,740
But the one component of the force of gravity that did not seem to have any offset

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,320
(at least the way we set up the problem in the last video)

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,400
is the force/component that is parallel to the surface of the plane

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,910
And we figured that out to be 49N, it was

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,750
essentially the weight of the block times the sin of this angle

23
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,020
And we said look, if there is no other forces

24
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,710
then it would be accelerated in this direction

25
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,870
And to figure out the rate of acceleration

26
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,030
you take the force in that direction divided by the mass of the block

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,880
and you would get 4.9 m/s^2

28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,970
Now let's say that wasn't happening. Let's say that you were to look at this system

29
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,620
right over here and the block was just stationary

30
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,460
And now, for the sake of argument, let's assume it is not ice on ice

31
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,100
Let's assume that they are both made out of wood

32
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,300
And now all of a sudden we have a situation where the block is stationary

33
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,480
If it is stationary, what is necessarily the case?

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,310
Well we already determined that if it is not accelerating in this normal direction

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,490
there must be zero net forces on it

36
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,420
But if it is stationary as a whole

37
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,920
then there must be zero net forces in the parallel component too

38
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:29,890
So there must be some force counteracting this 49 N that wants to take it down the slope

39
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:36,110
So there must be some force counteracting

40
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,920
the component of gravity that wants to accelerate it down the slope

41
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,870
And the question is what is this force? We're dealing with a situation now

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,880
where we're dealing with a stationary block, a block that is not accelerating

43
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,370
So what is that force?

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,430
I think you know from experience maybe what is the difference between

45
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,000
a block of wood on top of wood and a block of ice on top of ice

46
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,130
A block of ice on top of ice is much more slippery; there is no friction

47
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,320
between ice and ice, but there is friction between wood and wood

48
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,520
To make it a little bit more tangible, maybe we'd put some sandpaper on the surface over here

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,070
And then it becomes a little bit clearer. The force

50
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:25,530
that is keeping this block from sliding down in this situation is the force of friction

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,690
and the force of friction will always act in a direction opposite

52
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,090
to the motion if there was not any friction

53
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:44,230
or the potential acceleration if there was not any action

54
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,400
So what is the force of friction in this case?

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,460
Well, this block is completely stationary. It's not accelerating down the ramp

56
00:03:50,650 --> 00:04:06,810
The force of friction over here is going to be 49 N, upwards, up the ramp

57
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,820
Now I want think about, this is something that can be determined experimentally

58
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:17,860
as long as you have some way of measuring force, you can do this experimentally

59
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,090
But the interesting question here is

60
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,320
how much do I have to push on this block

61
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,140
until it starts to move down the ramp? How much do I have to push on it?

62
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,330
Let's say you are able to experimentally determine

63
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:55,230
that if you can apply another 1 N on this

64
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,930
then all of a sudden, I can at lease get the box to start accelerating down

65
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,080
Not the rate which it would do naturally, but I can just start to nudge it down

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,550
if I give it another push of one N in the parallel direction

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,590
So what is the total force--so exactly one N

68
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,740
So the total force at this point that's acting on it in order to just start to budge it

69
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,780
I'll call this the bulging force

70
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,600
Remember here isn't a traditional class

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,940
F sub B for the budging force

72
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,790
The budging force is in the parallel direction

73
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,820
If I'm applying 1 N in this direction and it already has 49 N due to

74
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,920
the component of gravity in this direction, then my budging force is 50 N

75
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,170
And so an interesting thing that you can determine

76
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,890
based on the materials that are coming in contact with each other is

77
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,080
just how much force you need to just start to overcome friction

78
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,620
In this case, it's the budging force. That's a term that I made up

79
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,860
And the interesting ratio which tends to hold for given materials pretty well

80
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,770
is the ratio between the amount of force just to budge it

81
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,810
and the amount of force between the two objects

82
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,130
between how much force they are exerting on each other

83
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:17,620
And in this case, the amount of force that is being exerted by this, by the wedge on the block

84
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,090
is the normal force, is 49 sqrt of 3

85
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,080
Maybe I should say the magnitude of the budging force

86
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,100
over the magnitude of the force that is putting these two things in contact

87
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,970
In this case, it is 49 square root of 3 N

88
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:43,270
Over the magnitude of the normal force, and that is 49 sqrt of 3

89
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,410
We call this the coefficient of static friction

90
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,690
We're gonna use this a little bit more deeply in other problems

91
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,010
but it tends to hold true for different materials so that

92
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,560
in the future if you have a different mass, you have a different incline

93
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,920
but you have the same materials

94
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,270
given the normal force, you can figure out the budging force

95
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,580
You can figure out exactly how much force you need to put

96
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,870
if you know this, which you usually figure out experimentally

97
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,240
So what would be the value in this case? You have 50 N over 49 square root of 3 N

98
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,240
Let's get the calculator out

99
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:31,840
So I have 50 divided by 40 times the square root of 3

100
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,430
Gives me .72--I'll just round to two significant digits--0.72

101
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,570
This is 0.72

102
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:52,210
And then you can use this information. This is the coefficient of static friction

103
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,330
We call it the coefficient of static friction because

104
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:02,470
this deals with the ratio of the force of friction relative to the normal force

105
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,130
I guess the force just to overcome the force of friction, just kind of get right over that

106
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,330
the most friction that can be applied by kind of the abrasiveness of the 2 things

107
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,510
when the object is stationary

108
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,890
I'll do a whole video on how this is different

109
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,830
when an object is stationary to when it's moving

110
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,430
A lot of times, they're very very very close, but for certain materials

111
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,160
you have a very--at least, a noticeably different coefficient

112
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,280
of friction when the object is stationery as opposed to when it is moving

113
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,730
So I'll leave you there. In the next few videos, we'll use coefficient of friction

114
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,270
or calculate coefficient of friction to do some more problems
