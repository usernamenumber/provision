1
00:00:00,631 --> 00:00:04,133
Before we start going off into things outside of our solar system

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:08,200
I wanna take a few steps back because I found this neat picture of

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,933
the sun over here, and the reason why at least in my mind it's kinda

4
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:16,800
mindblowing it's because at this scale the sun is obviously still a huge object

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,800
at this scale, the Earth would be roughly, and this is an approximation,

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,467
roughly that big, so for me at least, this is mindblowing because this idea

7
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:33,460
that our whole planet, everything we could fit into one of these kind of plasma flares

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,039
coming off of the sun, and you can only imagine, we can't realistically

9
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:40,333
be there but if you were in some type of protective capsule what it would be like

10
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,047
to be in this type of an enviroment

11
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:46,600
so I just thought this was kind of a fascinating concept, but anyway,

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,000
with that out of the way, let's just think about what it means to be

13
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:53,225
at the boundary of the Solar System, in the last video we explored the

14
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:59,133
Oort Belt which was about, it started a little under 1 light year away from the Sun

15
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:03,133
but depending on what you view as a boundary it could be something way

16
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:07,779
further in or as far out as something like the Oort Cloud

17
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:13,533
So if the Sun, well we see this things being ejected, but even in unseen ways

18
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:21,533
unseen particles, super high energy electrons and protons are also

19
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:29,032
being ejected from the Sun at super high velocities, 400 km/s, let me write that down

20
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:33,372
400 km/s

21
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:36,667
and on Earth we're protected from this highly energetic particles

22
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:42,721
because of Earth's magnetic field, but if you're on the surface of the Moon

23
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:47,892
when the Sun is on top of the Moon, and you're in the dark side of the Moon

24
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:51,897
you'll have direct contact with this, and you can imagine, not the best thing

25
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:56,600
to hang around in too long, but the whole reason why I'm talking about this,

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,028
this charged particles that are coming out at huge velocities

27
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:02,533
from the surface of the Sun, these are considered the Solar Wind

28
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:08,848
these are the Solar Wind, and I'll put the "Wind" in quotes

29
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,702
'cause it's really very different that out tradicional asociation of a nice breeze

30
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:17,903
these are just charged particles that are going out at super high velocities from the Sun

31
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:21,930
and I'm even going into the idea of the Solar Wind because to some degree

32
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,933
they can help us with one definition of maybe the limits of the Solar System

33
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:31,400
and that's the limits of how far the Solar Wind is getting before

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,129
it kinda comes in confrontation with the interstellar medium

35
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:40,400
and this right here shows a depiction of that, so the Oort Cloud is way

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,175
at least the edges of the dense part is way

37
00:02:44,175 --> 00:02:47,950
outside of this, as we saw this is just where Voyager I and Voyager II,

38
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:55,385
if we wanted the orbit of Sedna, it would be something like, the close part would

39
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:58,743
be something over here and then it would go out but the Oort Cloud is

40
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:03,498
much much further out, so if you look at this kind of view of the Solar System as the

41
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:07,007
extent of the Solar Wind it's much smaller than the Oort Cloud but it's still

42
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:12,359
farely large, so this is right here this heliopause right here, and I got this from

43
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:19,508
Wikipedia, this is essentially where the velocity and the forces of the Solar Wind are

44
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:26,048
counteracted, the preassure is so diluted at this point that it's counteracted

45
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:32,046
by mainly the hydrogen and the helium that's in the interstellar kind of

46
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:38,000
'medium', that's just kind of out there, after this point it's not being ejected out anymore

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,421
it's just kind of, there's this kind of 'pause' there, I guess you could say

48
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:46,298
and Voyager I and Voyager II have essentially gotten pretty close to

49
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:51,348
people believe, that 'pause' over there, and that's one view of the edges of the Solar System

50
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:55,462
there's never going to be any hard edge to it, another view would be something like

51
00:03:55,508 --> 00:04:01,323
the Oort Cloud, you know, the area where you have the still objects out there

52
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:05,477
and this is all, actually we haven't directly observed objects in the Oort Cloud,

53
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:11,031
we think they're out there, and then maybe the most abstract definition would be

54
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:16,569
the significant influence from the Sun's gravitational pull, so all of those ways

55
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:21,431
are to imagine the extent of the Solar System, but they all kinda leave a gray area

56
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:25,456
for what is and what is not in the Solar System, but my whole point here,

57
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:28,329
what I wanna do is start explaining a little bit outside of the Solar System

58
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:33,579
and just give you a sense of the scale as we just go to the closest start

59
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:38,575
so if we go right over here, this shows our local neighbourhood

60
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:42,320
from a stellar point of view, and even though this stars look pretty big, if you

61
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,369
actually were to draw, this is our Solar System right here, but clearly,

62
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:51,267
oh and you might be saying 'oh that's the Sun', no, the Sun

63
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:54,034
if you were to draw it here, it wouldn't even make up one pixel, in fact

64
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:59,654
the entire orbit of Pluto, everything inside it still wouldn't make up

65
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:05,933
one pixel on the screen right here, what we see right here, which is a radius

66
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:12,867
it's roughly a radius of about, give or take, a light year, this is roughly

67
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:19,298
maybe the radius of the Oort Cloud, and we saw in the last video how huge that was

68
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:28,267
especially relative to the radius of, say, Pluto's orbit, which is roughly

69
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:37,595
like that, and that itself it's a huge, huge diameter, a huge distance away from the Sun

70
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:44,255
and that wouldn't even make a pixel on this diagram right over here.

71
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:52,246
But just to give you an idea of how far we are, we're a speck of a speck of a speck inside here,

72
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:59,236
a pixel of a pixel in the center here, to make it from our Solar System, or in particular from Earth maybe

73
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:04,205
to the nearest star, or maybe the nearest cluster of stars, the Alpha Centauri

74
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:09,375
they're the nearest cluster of stars, there's 3 stars, Alpha Centauri A, which is

75
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:13,029
the largest, Alpha Centauri B, and then there's one that you can't

76
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:18,333
observe with the naked eye, Alpha Proximus, or I think Proximus Centauri I think it's called,

77
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:22,642
not Alpha Proximus, Proximus Centauri, so that's a much smaller star,

78
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:30,629
but that's the closest star, and this whole cluster of stars, and they're the closest,

79
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:40,000
is about 4.2 lightyears away, or another way to think about it, if someone were to shine a light

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,224
on one of these planets and assuming that light could get to us it would take 4.2 years

81
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:49,704
to get to us, or if this guys were to dissapear or blew up we wouldn't know it for 4.2 years

82
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:54,053
and you might say 'hey, that's not too bad, we should take a trip over there and check them out

83
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:58,354
and see if there are any other people there that we can meet, and exchange technologies

84
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:06,331
with or whatnot', but this is a huge distance, just this 4.2 lightyears is an unbelievably ridiculous

85
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:11,134
distance, and just to give you a sense, the Voyager I and II, we talked about them

86
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:13,684
in the last video and we an even see how far they've gotten, they've gotten

87
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:25,529
pretty much to the heliopause, this guys are traveling at 60,000km/h

88
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:34,044
which is the same thing as 17km/s, if we were able to get up to those type of velocities,

89
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:38,990
and this guys got up to this type of velocities by leveraging the gravitational

90
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,698
pull of some of the larger planets to keep accelerating, so this is

91
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:48,579
a pretty hard velocity to actually reach, but if you were able to reach that velocity

92
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:57,913
and go straight to the direction of the Alpha Centauri system, the closest starts to Earth,

93
00:07:57,913 --> 00:08:09,200
it would take you 80,000 years travelling at the same velocity as Voyager I, which is the fastest of

94
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,918
the Voyagers, so it's a ridiculously long time, so we're gonna have to figure out some better way to

95
00:08:14,918 --> 99:59:59,999
do that.
