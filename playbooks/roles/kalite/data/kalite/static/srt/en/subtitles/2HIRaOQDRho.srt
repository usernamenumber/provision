1
00:00:00,687 --> 00:00:04,480
let's say that company abcd is some type of pharmaceutical company

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,482
that has a drug trial coming out

3
00:00:06,482 --> 00:00:08,216
and you're convinced that

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,450
it's trading at 50 dollars a share

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,294
but you're convinced that if the drug gets approved

6
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:14,200
that the company's stock is going to skyrocket

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,621
and you're also convinced that the company

8
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:20,134
if the drug gets rejected that the stock price

9
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:22,715
is going to tank to maybe 5 or 10 dollars

10
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:24,696
so if you want to make money

11
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:26,278
off of that beleif

12
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:27,464
and I'm not necessarily reccommending

13
00:00:27,464 --> 00:00:28,549
that you do it

14
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:31,300
it's always tricker in reality than it sounds on paper

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,482
but one way that you could would be to buy the call option and the put option

16
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:37,613
on that stock

17
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:39,348
the put option is going to make you money if

18
00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:40,515
the stock tanks

19
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:42,203
and then the call option is going to make money

20
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:43,745
if the stock becomes, if the drug gets

21
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:46,536
approved and the stock skyrockets

22
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:49,418
so let's actually draw the payoff diagram

23
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:51,529
so if the stock goes down

24
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:52,653
if the stock goes down

25
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,934
let's say it goes down to zero

26
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:55,299
you sould exercise the put option

27
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:57,645
you could buy the stock for 0,

28
00:00:57,645 --> 00:00:59,218
excercise the put option

29
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:01,065
and sell it for 50 dollars

30
00:01:01,065 --> 00:01:03,987
this is the right to sell the stock for 50 dollars

31
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:09,228
and of course we're talking about the value of the combination at expiration

32
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:12,793
so if the stock is worth zero at experation

33
00:01:12,793 --> 00:01:14,897
then the put is worth 50

34
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:16,471
the call option is clearly worthless

35
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:19,203
you wouldn't exercise the call option if the stock is worth zero

36
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:22,961
you wouldn't want to buy something for 50 dollars that's worth zero

37
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:25,496
so from the stock being worth zero

38
00:01:25,496 --> 00:01:27,937
all the way up to the stock being worth 50

39
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:31,499
you would want to exercise the put option

40
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:35,116
but the value of the put option is going to become lower and lower and lower

41
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:38,866
and anything above 50 you wouldn't exercise the put option at all

42
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:42,382
if you get above 50, you would want to exercise your call option

43
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:46,152
if the stock is worth 60 dollars at expiration, then your call option is worth 10 dollars

44
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:49,899
because you have the right to buy something at 50

45
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:52,681
which you can sell for 60

46
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,364
so then you have the value of your call option

47
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:56,362
going up

48
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:58,879
so you can see a situation here when you think about the value

49
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,270
of this bundle of the call plus the put option

50
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:07,378
that it's not much value if the value of the stock doesn't change

51
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,908
from 50, your options are worthless

52
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:11,381
but you have a major movement

53
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,333
either to the upside or the downside,

54
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,046
then this straddle it's called

55
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:18,838
when you buy, when you go

56
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:22,133
long a call and long a put

57
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,319
this is called a long straddle

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,515
you benefit from a major price movement

59
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:28,814
when you think about it from the profit or loss point of view

60
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:30,482
you just shift it down from the

61
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:32,536
amount that you paid for the two options

62
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:36,764
in this case we paid 20 dollars for both options

63
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:39,303
so in this case where we exercise the put

64
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:41,213
instead of making 50 dollars

65
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:45,019
we have to net it for the 20 dollars we paid for the options

66
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:46,583
so we would only make 30 dollars

67
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,496
and at the point where we're not exercising either option

68
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:54,047
because they're both essentially worthless

69
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:56,035
there's no reason to exercise them

70
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:58,814
then essentially we have just lost 20 dollars

71
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:02,168
for both options so we will be down over here

72
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:06,587
and then anything above 50 dollars will start to make money

73
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,197
so let me draw the option diagram over here

74
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:13,467
it will look like this

75
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:15,633
the payoff diagram

76
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:19,251
it will look just like this

77
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:22,605
so when you actually factor in how much you paid for the options

78
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:26,722
you now see that you only would make money with this straddle

79
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,939
if the underlying stock price

80
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:32,188
myabe after the results of the trial

81
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:35,465
hopefully they get released before the maturity of the options

82
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:42,687
if the stock goes in this area

83
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:44,988
if the stock goes below 30

84
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:46,821
or if the stock goes above 70

85
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:48,105
but if it has one of those major movements,

86
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,232
then this position, this straddle

87
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:52,022
this long straddle will make you money
