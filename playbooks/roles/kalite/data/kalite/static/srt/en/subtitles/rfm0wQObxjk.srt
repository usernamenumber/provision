1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,100
I've got a transformation, m
that's a mapping from Rn to

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,420
Rn, and it can be represented
by the matrix A.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,310
So the transformation of x
is equal to A times x.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,500
We saw in the last video it's
interesting to find the

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,480
vectors that only get scaled
up or down by the

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,300
transformation.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,910
So we're interested in the
vectors where I take the

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,220
transformation of some
special vector v.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,580
It equals of course,
A times v.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,250
And we say it only gets scaled
up by some factor,

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,160
lambda times v.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,940
And these are interesting
because they make for

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,180
interesting basis vectors.

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,580
You know, the transformation
matrix in the alternate

16
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,680
basis-- this is one of
the basis vectors.

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,220
It might be easier to compute.

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,340
Might make for good coordinate
systems. But they're in

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,700
general, interesting.

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,660
And we call vectors v that
satisfy this, we call them

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,910
eigenvectors.

22
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,130
   

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:01,560
And we call their scaling
factors the eigenvalues

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,610
associated with this
transformation and that

25
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,350
eigenvector.

26
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,230
You know, hopefully from that
last video, we have a little

27
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,890
bit of appreciation of
why they're useful.

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,460
But now in this video let's at
least try to determine what

29
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,200
some of them are.

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,260
You know, based on what we know
so far, if you show me an

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,930
eigenvector I can verify that it
definitely is the case, or

32
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,620
an eigenvalue.

33
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,970
I could verify the case.

34
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,620
But I don't know a systematic
way of solving

35
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,400
for either of them.

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,750
So let's see if we can come
up with something.

37
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,840
So in general, we're looking for
solutions to the equation

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,350
A times v is equal
to lambda v.

39
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,750
It's equal to lambda
times the vector.

40
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,750
Now one solution might
immediately pop out at you,

41
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,800
and that's just v is equal
to the 0 vector.

42
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,210
And that definitely is a
solution, although it's not

43
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,100
normally considered to be an
eigenvector just because one,

44
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,610
it's not a useful
basis vector.

45
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,230
It doesn't add anything
to a basis.

46
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,800
It doesn't add really the amount
of vectors that you can

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,140
span when you throw the
basis vector in there.

48
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,420
And also, it's not clear what
is your eigenvalue that's

49
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,120
associated with it.

50
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,710
Because if v is equal
to 0, any eigenvalue

51
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,500
will work for that.

52
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,320
So normally when we're looking
for eigenvectors, we start

53
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,955
with the assumption that we're
looking for non-zero vectors.

54
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:17,880
So we're looking for vectors
that are not

55
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,545
equal to the 0 vector.

56
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:21,840
So given that, let's see if we
can play around with this

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,660
equation a little bit and see
if we can at least come up

58
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,260
with eigenvalues maybe
in this video.

59
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,730
So we subtract Av from both
sides, we get the 0 vector is

60
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,480
equal to lambda v
minus A times v.

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,460
Now, we can rewrite v as-- v is
just the same thing as the

62
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,690
identity matrix times v, right?
v is a member of Rn.

63
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,200
The identity matrix n by n.

64
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,580
You just multiply and we're
just going to get v again.

65
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,640
So if I rewrite v this way, at
least on this part of the

66
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,230
expression-- and let me swap
sides-- so then I'll get

67
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,390
lambda times-- instead of v
I'll write the identity

68
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:08,890
matrix, the n by n identity
matrix times v minus A times v

69
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,390
is equal to the 0 vector.

70
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,020
Now I have one matrix times v
minus another matrix times v.

71
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,140
Matrix vector products,
they have the

72
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,840
distributive property.

73
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,300
So this is equivalent to the
matrix lambda times the

74
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,630
identity matrix minus A
times the vector v.

75
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,810
And that's going to be
equal to 0, right?

76
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,930
This is just some matrix
right here.

77
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,580
   

78
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,180
And the whole reason why I made
this substitution is so I

79
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,770
can write this as a matrix
vector product instead of just

80
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,000
a scalar vector product.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,340
And that way I was able to
essentially factor out the v

82
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,700
and just write this whole
equation as essentially, some

83
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,350
matrix vector product
is equal to 0.

84
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,760
Now, in order-- if we assume
that this is the case, and

85
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,030
we're assuming-- remember,
we're assuming that v

86
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,920
does not equal 0.

87
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,890
So what does this mean?

88
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,980
So we know that v is a member
of the null space of this

89
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,990
matrix right here.

90
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,339
Let me write this down. v is a
member of the null space of

91
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:23,380
lambda I sub n minus A.

92
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,040
I know that might look a little
convoluted to you right

93
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,890
now, but just imagine this
is just some matrix B.

94
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,840
It might make it simpler.

95
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,580
This is just some matrix
here, right?

96
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,470
That's B.

97
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,750
Let's make that substitution.

98
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,460
Then this equation just becomes
Bv is equal to 0.

99
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,190
Now, if we want to look at the
null space of this, the null

100
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:48,940
space of B is all of the vectors
x that are a member of

101
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,450
Rn such that B times
x is equal to 0.

102
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,090
Well, v is clearly one
of those guys, right?

103
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,560
Because B times v
is equal to 0.

104
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,560
We're assuming B solves this
equation and that gets all the

105
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,940
way to the assumption that B
must solve this equation.

106
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,060
And v is not equal to 0.

107
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,320
So v is a member of the null
space and this is a nontrivial

108
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,180
member of the null space.

109
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,030
We already said the 0 vector is
always going to be a member

110
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,200
of the null space, and it
would make this true.

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,630
But we're assuming
v is non-zero.

112
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,170
We're only interested in
non-zero eigenvectors.

113
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,000
And that means that this guy's
null space has to be

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,070
nontrivial.

115
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:36,100
So this means that the null
space of lambda In minus A is

116
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,350
nontrivial.

117
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,240
   

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
The 0 vector is not
the only member.

119
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,650
And you might remember before,
that the only time-- let me

120
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,650
write this in general.

121
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,170
If I have some matrix--
I don't know.

122
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,270
I've used A and B.

123
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,235
Let's say I have
some matrix D.

124
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:59,050
   

125
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:08,310
D's columns are linearly
independent if and only if the

126
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:18,390
null space of D only contains
the 0 vector.

127
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,030
Right?

128
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,350
So if we have some matrix here
whose null space does not only

129
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,130
contain the 0 vector,
then it has

130
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,670
linearly dependent columns.

131
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,180
   

132
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,830
And I just wrote that there to
kind of show you what we do

133
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,110
know and the fact that this
one doesn't have a trivial

134
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,220
null space tells us that we're
dealing with linearly

135
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,670
dependent columns.

136
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,750
So lambda In minus A-- it looks
all fancy, but this is

137
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:52,590
just a matrix-- must have
linearly dependent columns.

138
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,120
Or another way to say that is,
if you have linearly dependent

139
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,220
columns, you're not invertible,
which also means

140
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,990
that your determinate
must be equal to 0.

141
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,740
All of these are true.

142
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,000
If your determinate is equal to
0, you're not going to be

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,230
invertible.

144
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,770
You're going to have linearly
dependent columns.

145
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,000
If your determinate is equal
to 0, then that also means

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,850
that you have nontrivial members
in your null space.

147
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,460
And so, if your determinate is
equal to 0 that means there's

148
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:27,030
some lambdas for which this is
true, for non-zero vectors v.

149
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,530
So, if there are some solutions,
if there are some

150
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:39,160
non-zero vector v's that satisfy
this equation, then

151
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:46,220
this matrix right here must
have a determinate of 0.

152
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,990
And it goes the other way.

153
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,830
If this guy has a determinate of
0, then there must be-- or

154
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,890
if there's some the lambdas
that make this guy have a

155
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,320
determinate of 0, then those
lambdas are going to satisfy

156
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,072
this equation.

157
00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:57,970
And you could go
the other way.

158
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,640
If there's some lambdas that
satisfy this, then those

159
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,060
lambdas are going to make this
matrix have a 0 determinate.

160
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,030
   

161
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,280
Let me write this.

162
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,890
   

163
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:29,620
Av is equal to lambda v for
non-zero v's if and only if

164
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:37,409
the determinate of lambda
In minus A is

165
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,080
equal to the 0 vector.

166
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,860
No, not the 0 vector.

167
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,159
Sorry, it's just equal to 0.

168
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,280
The determinate is just
a scalar factor.

169
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,590
And so that's our
big takeaway.

170
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,830
And I know what you're saying
now, how is that

171
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,270
useful for me, Sal?

172
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,040
You know, we did all of
this manipulation.

173
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,100
I talked a little bit about
the null spaces.

174
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,000
And my big takeaway is, is that
in order for this to be

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,690
true for some non-zero vectors
v, then lambda

176
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,085
has to be some value.

177
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:05,090
So if I take the determinate of
lambda times the identity

178
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,050
matrix minus A, it has
got to be equal to 0.

179
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,670
And the reason why this is
useful is that you can

180
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,820
actually set this equation up
for your matrices, and then

181
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,650
solve for your lambdas.

182
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,460
And we're going to do that
in the next video.

183
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:18,691
