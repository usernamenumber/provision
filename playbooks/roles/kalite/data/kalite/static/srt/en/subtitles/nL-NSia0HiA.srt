1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,030
Now on problem 37.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:11,640
And they say what is the value of xy minus yz.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,030
Statement one says, y is equal to 2.

4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,750
Well, that by itself doesn't help us.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,150
That just tells us 2x minus 2z.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,690
So if you don't know what x and z are

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,580
you can't figure out what this whole thing is

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,600
if you just know y is equal to 2.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,010
So that alone doesn't help.

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,970
Statement two is x minus z is equal to 5.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,770
Now this is interesting because this expression,

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,850
we can factor out the y.

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,010
What happens if we factor y out of both of these expressions?

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,430
I'm going to just rewrite it.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,320
xy minus zy-- I just switched the y and z--

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,070
that equals x minus z times y.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,620
Well, we can figure out x minus z from statement number two.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,090
x minus z, this is equal 5.

19
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,030
And we know what y is equal to from statement one.

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,060
So y is equal to 2.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,020
So we can definitely figure it out

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,670
as long as we have both statements

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,480
and we can show that the answer is y is equal to 2.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,510
So the answer is, 2 times 5 is 10.

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,300
But we didn't have to figure it out.

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,270
We just have to know that we could figure it out

27
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,380
if we had both of these data points.

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,850
One by themselves, you wouldn't be able to solve it.

29
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,900
So the answer is C.

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,040
Both statements together are sufficient but neither alone is.

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,000
Problem 38.

32
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,790
OK, they drew us a picture.

33
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,200
Let me see if I can draw that same picture,

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,090
looks like some type of device.

35
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,420
So it looks like that and then they have the other end,

36
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,050
and the other end looks like that.

37
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,210
There are these handles, or something that looks like handles

38
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,020
I haven't read the problem yet.

39
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,640
So they say will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,530
encyclopedia fit upright in the book rack shown above?

41
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,270
So this is a book rack.

42
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,750
So I guess the books get stacked that way.

43
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,740
And they labeled this right here, this dimension is x.

44
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,850
And they're saying, will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume

45
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,520
encyclopedia fit upright in the book rack shown above?

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,550
So essentially I'm going to put the first 10 in there.

47
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,720
So the first statement they say,

48
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,080
is that x is equal to 50 centimeters.

49
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,300
Well, that doesn't help me because I don't know

50
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,250
how big the first 10 volumes of the encyclopedia are.

51
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,870
If each of them are, at least the first 10 are,

52
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,160
less than 5 centimeters each

53
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,830
or on average less than 5 centimeters,

54
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,870
then maybe I could fit them.

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,070
But one by itself doesn't help me.

56
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,690
Two: 12 of the volumes

57
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,090
have an average thickness of 5 centimeters.

58
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,830
Well, that doesn't help me either because remember,

59
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,170
they're saying will the first 10 volumes

60
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,000
of a 20 volume encyclopedia?

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,980
Maybe the 12 that have an average thickness of 5 centimeters,

62
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,550
maybe those are the volumes 8 through 20

63
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,950
and maybe volumes 1 through 7 have an average thickness

64
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,930
of 50 centimeters each or 5 million centimeters each.

65
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,660
So even both of these conditions combined don't help me know

66
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,930
if I can definitely fit the first 10 volumes

67
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,000
of the 20 volume encyclopedia.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,050
So that is E.

69
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,040
Both statements together are still not sufficient.

70
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,030
Problem 39.

71
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,530
A circular tub--

72
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,330
OK, so they've drawn this circular-looking tub.

73
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,060
So the top looks like that.

74
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,720
And then there's two sides.

75
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,200
Let's me see how well I can construct what they've drawn.

76
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,080
And the bottom looks something like that.

77
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,030
And then they shade in a little area,

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,000
a strip of this, like that.

79
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,370
And they say a circular tub has a painted band

80
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,000
has a band painted around its circumference as show above.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,090
So this is the painted band around its circumference.

82
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,360
What is the surface area of the painted band?

83
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,940
And they tell us that the height of the painted band is x.

84
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,660
So in order to essentially know the surface area,

85
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,540
you'd have to know the height, which is x,

86
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,230
times the circumference of the circle,

87
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,820
Right? which would be the length.

88
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,090
So if you knew the height times circumference of the circle,

89
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,210
you'd be able to know the surface area.

90
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,800
So they tell us, the first statement,

91
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,790
x is equal to 0.5, whatever, meters.

92
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,030
So this is in meters.

93
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,000
0.5 meters, so that alone doesn't help us.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,280
We have to be able to figure out

95
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,090
the circumference of this tub

96
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,000
in order to really be able to figure out the surface area

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,420
because the circumference times this height

98
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,040
will be the surface area.

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,010
Point two: they say the height of the tub is one meter.

100
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,040
So they're telling us that this is one meter.

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,490
Well that doesn't help us.

102
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,120
That still doesn't tell us how far around the tub goes.

103
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,670
If they had given us the diameter or the radius

104
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,770
or the circumference then we could've used our basic geometry

105
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,710
to figure out the circumference.

106
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,680
But they didn't.

107
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,100
So either way-- it's a one meter height--

108
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,190
both of these combined still do not allow us

109
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,000
to figure out the surface area of this green band.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,080
E again.

111
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,000
Problem 40.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,040
What is the value of integer n?

113
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,660
And n as an integer.

114
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,700
So statement number one:

115
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:48,070
they tell us that n times n plus 1 is equal to 6.

116
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,630
Now we should already be able to figure this out

117
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,020
because n is an integer, n plus 1 is an integer.

118
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,230
So what are the factorizations of 6?

119
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,000
You could have 1 times 6.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,940
But that doesn't fit n and n plus 1, right?

121
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,390
This is n and n plus 5.

122
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,690
You have 2 times 3, which work, right.

123
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,020
If 2 is n, n plus 1 is 3 and they equal 6.

124
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,560
So let me circle that.

125
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,200
And then what other factorizations?

126
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,640
You don't have any other-- these are all of the factors 6.

127
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,090
So just looking at the first statement,

128
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,010
you know that n has to be equal to 2.

129
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,630
This is the only integer where this is true.

130
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,680
Actually, let me take a step back.

131
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,030
No, what if n is negative?

132
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,300
Because I was assuming it's a positive integer

133
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,660
but they didn't say it's a positive integer,

134
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,090
so let me think about that.

135
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,980
If I did minus 3 times minus 2,

136
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,060
that also equals 6 and these are both integers.

137
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,530
Huh, OK, so this isn't enough.

138
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,140
Because in this case, n could be--

139
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,200
could this would be n and this is would be n plus 1--

140
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,290
so n is either equal to 2 or n is equal to minus 3.

141
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,170
That's a little tricky.

142
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,340
The intuition is to just assume that n is positive

143
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,000
but it doesn't have to be positive.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,070
So n could be 2 or minus 3 here.

145
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,600
That's a tricky one.

146
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,040
So that one by itself does not help us solve the problem.

147
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,450
The second part of it, point two it says,

148
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,010
2 to the 2n is equal to 16.

149
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,990
And whenever you have these in the SAT or the GMAT

150
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,570
or anything whenever you have a variable in the exponent,

151
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,020
your goal really is to just get everything in the same base.

152
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,060
So we could write the left-hand side the same.

153
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,420
So that's 2 to the 2n.

154
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,880
And how do we write 16 with the base 2?

155
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,050
Well, 16 is just 2 to the fourth, right?

156
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,390
And so we get 2n is equal to 4.

157
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,080
n is equal to 2.

158
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,010
So this statement alone is enough to figure it out.

159
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,600
This statement alone is not.

160
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,210
So the answer is B.

161
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,090
Statement two alone is sufficient.

162
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,000
40 is B.

163
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,610
And this was tricky because one,

164
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,420
you think that 1n alone is sufficient

165
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,070
but it is ambiguous because and n could be minus 3.

166
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,080
41.

167
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,780
41. OK. They've drawn a bunch of, if I see this right,

168
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,090
They draw a bunch of-- two lines.

169
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,050
Let's see if I can draw this.

170
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,110
So a line and then there's a bunch of circles.

171
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:51,020
One circle, two circles they have, and then they keep going.

172
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,080
Three circles, and then one more.

173
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,390
It's going to be right there. Four circles.

174
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,250
I think that's about right.

175
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,960
And they say essentially that the circles

176
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,050
just keep going on and on.

177
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,000
That's what I think the drawing implies.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,720
They say the inside of a rectangular carton

179
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:30,610
is 48 centimeters long, 32 centimeters wide

180
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,040
and 15 centimeters high

181
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,030
OK. So that's the inside.

182
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,630
Kind of from the other wall.

183
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,730
This is the floor of the inside of the container

184
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,130
and then there would be another up here.

185
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,040
But I think you get the idea.

186
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,630
The carton is filled to capacity with k

187
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,710
identical cylindrical cans of fruit that stand upright

188
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,420
in rows and columns as indicated in the figure above.

189
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,450
OK. So this is like a top view of it.

190
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,760
So we could say that this side up here,

191
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,010
this is 48 and then this is 32.

192
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,080
So we don't care so much about the height, I think.

193
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,000
So, let's see, the carton is filled to capacity with k

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,780
identical cylindrical cans of fruit that stand upright

195
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,550
in rows and columns as indicated in figure above.

196
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,300
If the cans are 15 centimeters high--

197
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,780
OK, so each of the cans are exactly 15 centimeters high.

198
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,560
So they literally are exactly as high as the carton.

199
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,000
If the cans are 15 centimeters high, what is the value of k?

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,090
So we have to figure out

201
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,040
how many of these cans will fit in this area essentially?

202
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,720
And then they tell us point number one:

203
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,350
each of the cans have a radius of 4 centimeters.

204
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,120
Radius is 4 centimeters.

205
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,810
Well,

206
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,260
if we know that each of them have a radius of 4 centimeters

207
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,310
then we know exactly

208
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,840
how much square area each of these circles will take up,

209
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,060
assuming that they're packed exactly like this, right?

210
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,020
Because if you think about it, what is this area right here?

211
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, there's a bunch of were different ways

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,840
you could think about it.

213
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,910
The easiest is that if the radius is 4 centimeters,

214
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,930
that the diameter right here is 8 centimeters.

215
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,780
So if this is 8 and you have a 48 length,

216
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,430
you can only do 6 of these, right?

217
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,010
6 times 8 is 48.

218
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,890
So you can only do 6 that way.

219
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,700
And then if the diameter is 8 this way and this length is 32,

220
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,070
you can only do 4 this way.

221
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,340
So statement number one, alone,

222
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,690
is enough to figure out how many you can put.

223
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,810
It would actually be 4 times 6.

224
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,530
You could put 24, k would be 24 cans that you could fit in.

225
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,390
So statement one, alone, is enough.

226
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,020
Now what does statement two tell us?

227
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:43,950
6 of the cans sit exactly along the length of the carton.

228
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,340
So they're telling us that these cans,

229
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,450
there's 6 cans that fit right along the length,

230
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,020
which we figured out from statement number one.

231
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,370
But that also gives you the same information

232
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,690
as statement number one.

233
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,040
Because you know that these are cylindrical cans.

234
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,880
I think it's a safe assumption to say that these are circles.

235
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,760
Yeah. A cylinder, you're assuming that the tops are circles.

236
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,120
So if you say that 6 can fit that way,

237
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,910
then you know that the diameter of each of them is 8 centimeters

238
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,630
and then you can make the same argument

239
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,870
that the diameter's 8 centimeters to say

240
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,650
that 4 can fit the other way down.

241
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:30,000
So two, alone, is also sufficient by itself.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,440
So the answer is, what is that, C?

243
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,040
Both statements-- no D, each statement, alone, is sufficient.

244
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,020
See you in the next video.
