99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're in Nablus, at the archaeological museum,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
looking at one of the most famous sculptures from all the antiquity.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It was discovered in the Renaissance during archaeological excavations in Rome

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the Baths of Caracalla.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the so called Farnese Hercules and it gets that name,

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because it was excavated by the Farnese Family.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They've been looking for building materials to take from ancient sited to build a new palace.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But what they found in the Baths was an extraordinary array of ancient sculptures.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We could reconstruct the original site for this collossal sculpture.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There were mosaic floors, walls made of different coloured marble.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
An incredibly luxurious bathing complex, used by thousands of Romans every day.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it was decorated with hundreds of sculptures, many of them collossal, like this one.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These were really complex structures, these bathing facilities.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They were the baths themselves, some were cold, some were hot,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there were rooms for transition from ane temperature to another,

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there were places, where one could exercise.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this sculpture makes perfect sense in this environment.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a place, where you would go to work out, or you would go to exercise.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you could look at this wildly muscular figure and have a bit of a goal.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Many of the sculptures that were found in the Baths of Caracalla

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were not the typical ideal athletic copies of Greek sculptures, that we think of,.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but they were especially bulky, like the Hercules that we see here.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we know that some successful Greek athletes would sometimes dedicate sculptures to Hercules

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in a way thanking him for their successes.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He was a symbol of strength and hero.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can see that here, but there's also irony in Lysippos' treatment,

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because even as we see this wildly powerful figure, this incredible musculature,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we also see a figure, that is exhausted.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He really is. He leans almost his full weight on a club,that is propped up under his arm.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so right, there is light irony between the brut strength of his muscles

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the === of his pose.
