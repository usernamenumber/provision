1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,520
We're asked to subtract,
simplify the answer and write

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,710
as a mixed number.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,170
So we have two mixed numbers
here, and like when you're

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,300
adding mixed numbers, you
can do it two ways.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,370
You can either turn both of
these into improper fractions

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,480
and then subtract, or you can
subtract the whole number part

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,470
and then the fraction part,
so let's do it that way.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,484
So just to remind ourselves,
5 and 5/8 is the exact same thing

9
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:24,525
Let me write it here in yellow.

10
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:29,240
as 5 plus 5/8. 
These are the exact same thing.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,962
And subtracting-- let me write
this subtraction sign in blue--

12
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:36,230
and then we're
subtracting 2 and 1/5, but 2

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,390
and 1/5 is the exact same
thing as 2 plus 1/5.

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,710
That's what 2 and
1/5 really is.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,540
Now if we're subtracting, that
means we have to subtract 2

16
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,360
and we're subtracting the 1/5.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,410
Distributive property.

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,330
We're subtracting both of them.

19
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:57,690
So we get 5 plus 5/8, and then
we distribute the negative sign,

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,010
minus 2 minus 1/5.

21
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,440
And now we can rearrange it.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,503
We can say this is the same
thing as... Let me do it in orange...

23
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:15,270
as 5 minus 2, that's the whole number parts, and

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:22,744
then you have plus 5/8 minus 1/5.

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,010
Now, 5 minus 2, that's pretty straightforward.

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,120
That's just 3.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,820
But what's 5/8 minus 1/5?

28
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,720
Let's do that over here.

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,930
So we have 5/8 minus 1/5.

30
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,700
Now, just like when you're
adding fractions, when you're

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,319
subtracting fractions, you
have to have a common denominator.

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,000
8 and 5 are not the same
denominator so we have to find

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,940
the least common multiple
of these two numbers.

34
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,850
If we do a prime factorization
of 8, you get 2 times 4.

35
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,750
4 is 2 times 2.

36
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,620
So 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,390
That's if you break it down into
its constituent primes.

38
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,180
5 is just 5, because it
is a prime number.

39
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,180
So the least common multiple of
8 and 5 has to have a 5 and

40
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,350
three 2's in it.

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,380
Or another way of saying it, it
has to be 5 times 2 times 2

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,900
times 2, which is the same
thing as 5 times 8.

43
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,680
So the least common multiple is
going to be-- because these

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,900
guys share no common factors
other than 1 really.

45
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,850
The least common multiple is
just going to be 8 times 5.

46
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,790
So the least common multiple
is going to be 40.

47
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,970
It's going to be 40.

48
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,510
Now, to go from 8 to 40, you
have to multiply by 5.

49
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,970
Then we have to do the same
thing to the numerator.

50
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,689
If we multiplied 8 times 5,
we have to multiply 5 times 5 to get 25.

51
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:47,235
So in either case, we're multiplying times 5, 
the numerator and the denominator.

52
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,840
Now, to go from 5 to 40, we have
to multiply by 8, so we

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,780
also have to do that for the
numerator, so 1 times 8 is 8.

54
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,710
So now we have 25/40 minus
40/40, which would be equal

55
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,420
to-- we're going to have
40 as the denominator.

56
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,860
25 minus 8 is 17.

57
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,350
So 5/8 minus 1/5, which is the
same thing as 25/40 minus

58
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,260
8/40, is equal to 17/40.

59
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,790
And 17 is a prime number so it's
not going to share any

60
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:24,400
common factors with 40, or at
least 40 isn't divisible by 17

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,140
either, so this is as simplified
as we can get.

62
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,590
So this part, the [integer] part,
is 3 and the fraction

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,934
part is 17/40. And we're done

64
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,040
And this worked.

65
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,250
We were able to separate this
out and do it pretty

66
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,380
straightforward, because in this
situation, the fraction

67
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,299
part that we're subtracting from
the other fraction part was smaller.

68
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,430
If it was larger, it would've
gotten a little bit messy.

69
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,460
Maybe we would have ended up
with a negative number and we

70
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,650
would've done all this other
stuff, so that's why sometimes

71
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,726
it's easier to go straight
to an improper fraction for both of them.

72
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,240
But in this case, it worked
out doing it this way.
