1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,730
   

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,670
This is another brain teaser
that deals with people trying

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,240
to logically deduce what's
on their forehead.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,939
And it's called the Forehead
Number Game.

5
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:19,960
   

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,400
So what's going to happen is I
guess you could say the god of

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,760
brain teasers is going
to get three

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,790
people in a room together.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,250
Once again, these three people
are perfect logicians.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:36,060
   

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,710
Which means they have infallible
powers of logic.

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,750
And they know that the other
two people-- they're three

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,190
people in total --are also all
perfect logicians and have

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,740
infallible powers of logic.

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,910
We get them into the circle,
and we'll say

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,790
this is the top view.

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,630
So this is the top of
one guy's forehead.

18
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,410
They're all bald for
convenience.

19
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,910
To make it easy to paint
things on their head.

20
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,780
This time we're not going
to paint blue

21
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,700
paint on their forehead.

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,790
We're actually going
to paint numbers.

23
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,040
So you could say the dungeon
master of this game, or the

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,510
the god of this game says I'm
going to pick three numbers.

25
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,830
So three numbers
will be picked.

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,560
They will be unique.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,260
Which means that no two of these
numbers are going to be

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,880
the same number.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,030
There are going to be three
different numbers.

30
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,210
They're all going to be
greater than zero.

31
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,840
And this is key: One of the
numbers is going to be the sum

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,090
of the other two.

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:38,950
   

34
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,740
And they tell this to all
of the logicians.

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,390
So this is the method that they
use to pick the number.

36
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,940
And they tell this to the three
parties right there.

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,790
And what they do is they take
these three numbers.

38
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,970
And they write them on
people's foreheads.

39
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,260
So say the numbers
are a, b and c.

40
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,670
And we know that a plus-- let me
scroll down a little bit b

41
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,030
is equal to c.

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,640
We know that a, b and
c are different.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,490
And we know that a is
greater than zero.

44
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,520
b is greater than zero.

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,540
And c is also greater
than zero.

46
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,160
What they do is they paint
them on their heads.

47
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,790
So this guy will have
a on his forehead.

48
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,820
This guy will have b
on his forehead.

49
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,900
And let's say this guy has
c on his forehead.

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,100
And so when this guy looks out--
and you know, the reason

51
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,290
we're even putting things on
people's foreheads is because

52
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,070
you can't see what's on
your own forehead.

53
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,370
No tricks involved here.

54
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,960
All you can see is what's on the
forehead of the other two

55
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,100
people in the game.

56
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,290
So this guy is going
to see a and b.

57
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,470
This guy right here is going to
see the foreheads c and a.

58
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,520
And then this guy's going
to see these two

59
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,220
foreheads, c and b.

60
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,690
So that's the rules
of the game.

61
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,800
And of course, you don't know;
this guy, the number on his

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,500
forehead is c.

63
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,050
And it happens to be
the sum of a and b.

64
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,960
But he doesn't know that.

65
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,010
He doesn't know whether
it's the sum or not.

66
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,950
He doesn't know he has
the sum number.

67
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,580
This is just the way I
happened to draw it.

68
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,740
So given those rules
of the game.

69
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,415
And let's say you're
one of the players.

70
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,640
   

71
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,110
And this is the view you see.

72
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,200
You look at the two other
people in the game.

73
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,020
Let me see if I can draw them
a little bit better.

74
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,050
So you look at one person.

75
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,740
This is your view.

76
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,870
So this is one person
in the game.

77
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,810
On his forehead-- which
is fairly large-- you

78
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:28,430
see the number 20.

79
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:34,630
And on the next guy, who
I'll draw in purple.

80
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:43,640
The next guy, you see
the number 30.

81
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,000
And what happens is-- so this
is literally your view.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,570
So they're seeing you with some
number on your forehead.

83
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,400
And this guy can
see this 20 and

84
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,370
whatever's on your forehead.

85
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,210
This guy can see this 30 and
whatever's on your forehead.

86
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,600
And the game show host, or the
dungeon master or soon.

87
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,920
whoever, says, OK what's
on your forehead?

88
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,970
And you look at these two
people, and you say, gee, I

89
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,090
don't know what's
on my forehead.

90
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,660
I'm a perfect logician, but I
still can't figure out what's

91
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,450
on my forehead.

92
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,930
And they say, OK fair enough.

93
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,790
Then they go to this guy.

94
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,010
We call him whatever we
want to call this guy.

95
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,390
And they say, hey you,
do know what

96
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,510
number's on your forehead?

97
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,560
And he looks at whatever
number's on my

98
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,350
forehead over here.

99
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,500
Let's say this is my forehead.

100
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,710
I don't know what number's
written on it.

101
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,290
Some number's written up here.

102
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,390
He looks at this number and then
at that guy, and says,

103
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,620
you know what, I really don't
know what my number is.

104
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,070
They say, OK fair enough.

105
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,970
Then you turn to this guy.

106
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,230
And you say, hey you, look
at this guy and that guy.

107
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,450
Do you know what
your number is?

108
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,340
And he looks at that number, and
he looks at the number on

109
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,890
your forehead.

110
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,620
And he says, you know what?

111
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,615
I really don't know
what my number is.

112
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:53,850
And then they come
back to you.

113
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,060
And then you, as a perfect
logician says, oh, now I know

114
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,980
what my number is.

115
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,160
So my question to you-- and this
is the question of the

116
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,570
brain teaser-- is, what
is your number?

117
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,820
And why?

118
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:15,980
   

119
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,110
So that's the question.

120
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,130
And everything I'm going to do
from this point on in the

121
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,750
video is essentially
going to be a hint.

122
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,340
And then I'll actually
give the solution.

123
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,410
So let's think about
it a little bit.

124
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,760
And pause it, stop
it, whatever.

125
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,730
Think about it for a while.

126
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,620
And I would say this
is a fairly

127
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,940
advanced level brain teaser.

128
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,190
And it takes a lot of
trial and error.

129
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,400
But the solution-- just as a
little bit of a hint-- isn't

130
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,600
an ultre-complicated one, where
you have to know some

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,160
higher level math.

132
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,130
It's, once again,
very logical.

133
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,010
You can make very logical
deductions here.

134
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,100
You don't need any higher
math to really come

135
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,550
to the correct answer.

136
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,880
So let's lay it all out.

137
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,970
So if I were to draw
the top view.

138
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,360
We'll do it in yellow.

139
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,890
This is you.

140
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,420
This is the guy with
20 on his forehead.

141
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,480
And this is the guy with
30 on his forehead.

142
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,320
And what do we know?

143
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,210
Let's call whatever's
on your forehead a.

144
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,150
That's what you want
to figure out.

145
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,260
So we know that a is
greater than zero.

146
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,680
These are obviously
greater than zero.

147
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,270
You see those already.

148
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,110
We know that a can't
be 20 or 30.

149
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,310
Now this is the interesting
thing.

150
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,780
They told us that the numbers on
one of our foreheads is the

151
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,400
sum of the numbers on the
other two foreheads.

152
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,120
So either-- this
is a big hint.

153
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,660
I think you might be able
to run with this after

154
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,580
you get this hint.

155
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,110
You say either a is a sum
of these two numbers.

156
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:52,420
So a is equal to 20 plus
30, which would mean

157
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,680
a is equal to 50.

158
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,600
What's the other option?

159
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,940
Either these two numbers, when
you sum them, is equal to a.

160
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,230
That's one possibility.

161
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:10,100
The other possibility is 20
plus a is equal to 30.

162
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,500
Or, a is equal to 10.

163
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,980
And of course I can't say that
30 plus a is equal to 20,

164
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,800
because a can't be minus 10.

165
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,150
That's the only other
possibility.

166
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,930
And we already said that
all the numbers are

167
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,550
greater than zero.

168
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,840
So every one of these players
knows that their number on

169
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,760
their forehead is either the sum
of the other two numbers,

170
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,850
or it's the difference of
the other two numbers.

171
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,250
This guy says, you know what?

172
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,720
My number is either 30 plus a,
or it's the difference between

173
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,510
a and 30, depending on
whichever is bigger.

174
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,960
And he can see which
one's bigger.

175
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,550
I can't see.

176
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,900
So you can say the absolute
value of 30 minus a.

177
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,090
He knows that about
his number.

178
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:55,540
This guy, he knows that his
number is either 20 plus a, or

179
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,695
the absolute value
of 20 minus a.

180
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:03,730
And this all comes from the clue
or the rule that one of

181
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,080
these numbers you is the sum
of the other two numbers.

182
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,220
Although, you don't know if
you have the sum number on

183
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,880
your forehead, or you don't know
if you have one of the

184
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,030
numbers that make up the
sum on your forehead.

185
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,860
But let's go back to our-- So
right from the beginning of

186
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,000
the game, before anyone asks
us a question, we know that

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,800
the number on our forehead
is either 50 or it is 10.

188
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,370
And that's a pretty good hint,
and you might be able to take

189
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:29,960
it from there.

190
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,970
I mean, we've narrowed down the
universe of numbers from

191
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,230
an infinite number of numbers
to two numbers.

192
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,929
And this guy can just deduce
that automatically.

193
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,360
So what other information
was given in the game?

194
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,300
Well, we actually went
around the circle.

195
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,670
So the first time you asked this
guy what number he had,

196
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,740
he didn't know.

197
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,990
He would be able to say, well
I either have 50 or 10, but

198
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,740
that's not enough for me to make
a bold statement that my

199
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,640
number is definitely 50,
or that my number

200
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,360
is definitely 10.

201
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
And so what other information
was there?

202
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,730
We went to this guy, and
this guy wasn't able

203
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,070
to guess his number.

204
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,940
Then this guy wasn't able
to guess his number.

205
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,730
And now the argument is that
now you should be able to

206
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,160
guess your number.

207
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,940
So let's think about
what happens.

208
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:16,800
In the situation where this
guy is 50-- Well actually,

209
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,860
let's take the other
situation.

210
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,530
Let's take the situation
where this guy is 10.

211
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,490
If this guy is 10, what
will this person see?

212
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,050
And I'll do this situation
in green.

213
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,280
This guy will say, I'm
either 30 plus 10.

214
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,560
So he'll say, I'm either 40.

215
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,230
Or I'm 30 minus 10.

216
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,660
Or I'm 20, right?

217
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,810
And he says, well, you know, no
real good conclusion I can

218
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,170
make there.

219
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,980
I could either be 40 or 20,
and I can't figure it out.

220
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,130
Fair enough.

221
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,630
Now you turn to this guy.

222
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,030
In the situation where this
guy is 10, what's this guy

223
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,160
going to say?

224
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,730
He's going to say I'm
either 20 plus 10.

225
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm either 30, or I
am 20 minus 10.

226
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
So 20 minus 10 would be 10.

227
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,420
And you say, wait, wait, hold
on a second though.

228
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,430
I can't be 10.

229
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,920
Because if I were 10 and this
guy were 10, that would

230
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,540
violate the rules of the game.

231
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,990
One of the rules of the
game said that every

232
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,480
number had to be unique.

233
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,730
Every number had to
be different.

234
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,290
So if you were 10-- you know
from the beginning to you're

235
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,790
either 50 or 10-- if you are 10,
then when you go to this

236
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,080
guy, he would be able to
deduce that he is 30.

237
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,840
And how would he be able
to deduce that he's 30?

238
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,540
Because he sees this
20 right here.

239
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,000
If you were a 10, he'd
see a 20 and a 10.

240
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,020
And he would say, I'm either
the sum of those numbers or

241
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,080
the difference.

242
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,860
If I'm the sum, I'm 30.

243
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,690
If I'm the difference, I'm 10.

244
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,480
But then he would say, I can't
be 10, because you're 10.

245
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,030
And all the numbers
are different.

246
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,960
So I have to be 30.

247
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,570
Right?

248
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,660
So in the reality where you are
10, when you go around the

249
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,290
circle, this guy would
be able to figure out

250
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,910
what number he is.

251
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,200
Right?

252
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,510
Because he's a perfect
logician.

253
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,190
But in the problem statement I
gave you, we went around the

254
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,790
circle and this guy couldn't
figure out what number he is.

255
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:18,620
He couldn't establish the fact
that he is definitely 30.

256
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,360
So given the fact that he
couldn't establish that he is

257
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,160
30, it means that he did
not see a 10 here.

258
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,580
He definitely did
not see a 10.

259
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,740
If he saw a 10 there, he
would say, I am 30.

260
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,600
Because I know I cannot be 10.

261
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,180
So we know that you don't have
a 10 on your forehead, and so

262
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,920
that's why when you come
back to you, you say, I

263
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,900
know I must be 50.

264
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,490
50 is the number on my forehead,
because if I were

265
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,000
10, this guy would have been
able to get it before me.

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,960
He would have been able to get
the number on his forehead

267
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,900
before coming back to me.

268
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,020
Anyway, I thought you would
enjoy that brain teaser.

269
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,530
   

270
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,030
I didn't think of this one.

271
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,300
I actually didn't think of any
of these, although they have a

272
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,870
little bit of my twist
on some of them.

273
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,760
But I'll be sure to add more.

274
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,010
See

275
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,982
