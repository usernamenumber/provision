1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
In all of the torque problems
I've done so far in the

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,910
physics playlist, we only just
figured out the magnitude of

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,610
torque, frankly because that's
what normally matters, but

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,500
torque is actually
a vector and it's

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,380
direction can be found.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,160
And that is because torque is
defined as the cross product

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,330
between the radial distance from
your axis of rotation and

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,370
the rotational force
being applied.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,810
So these are both vectors.

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,350
So let's take a look at how I
taught you vectors the first

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,300
time, and then I'll show you
how that's really the same

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,860
thing as what we're doing here
with the cross product.

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,570
Except now with the cross
product, besides just the

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,590
magnitude for torque, we're also
getting the direction.

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,850
But then we'll also see that
direction is a little bit--

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,080
it's just the definition of
the direction of torque.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,300
I don't know how intuitive
it really is.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,950
But what did I teach you
before about torque?

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:01:02,410
Well, let's say I had some arm,
and let's say this could

21
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,269
be the hand of a clock or it's
pinned down to the wall there.

22
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,690
So it would rotate around
this object.

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:14,060
   

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:21,070
Let's say it's some distance,
r, from the pivot.

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,350
Let's say that distance is 10.

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,670
This is the same thing as r,
and the magnitude of r is

27
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,870
equal to 10.

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,290
At some distance 10 from the
pivot, I apply some force F,

29
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,260
and F I will do in yellow.

30
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,370
I apply some force F.

31
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,190
Let me draw it straight.

32
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,360
I apply some force
F at some angle.

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,960
   

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,530
That's my force F.

35
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,390
It's also a vector.

36
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,610
It has magnitude
and direction.

37
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,280
Let's say that this is 10
meters, and let's say that I

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,120
apply a force of 7 newtons.

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,669
Let me make it more
interesting.

40
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,120
Let's say I apply a force of
square root of 3 newtons.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,840
And I just threw that out there
because I think the

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,450
numbers will all work out.

43
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,790
And let's say that the angle
between my force and the lever

44
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,550
arm, or the arm that's
rotating-- let's stick to

45
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,720
radians this time.

46
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,950
Let's say it's pi over 3, but if
you need to visualize that,

47
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,480
that's 60 degrees.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,920
pi over 3 radians is
equal to theta.

49
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,870
And so just based on what we
already know about moments or

50
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,120
torque, what is the torque
around this pivot?

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,600
Or how much torque is being
applied by this force?

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,420
And when we learn torque or we
learn moments, we realize

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,180
really the only hard part about
these problems is that

54
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,410
you don't just multiply the
entire rotational force times

55
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,910
the distance from the
axis of rotation.

56
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,230
You have to multiply the
component of that force that

57
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,660
is actually doing the rotation,
or the component of

58
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,860
the force that is perpendicular
to this rotating

59
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,090
arm, or perpendicular
to this moment arm.

60
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,260
So how do we figure that out?

61
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,480
Well, the component of this
force that is perpendicular to

62
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,465
this arm-- I can visually
draw it here.

63
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:24,850
Let's see, it would look
something like this.

64
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,330
   

65
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,160
I could draw it there.

66
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,150
I could also draw
it here, right?

67
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,310
This would be the component, or
this would be the component

68
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,620
that is perpendicular to this
rotating arm, and the

69
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,570
component that is parallel would
be this, but we don't

70
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,210
care about that.

71
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,970
That's not contributing
to the rotation.

72
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,350
The only thing that is
contributing to the rotation

73
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,890
is this component
of the force.

74
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,600
   

75
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,880
And what is the magnitude of
this vector right here?

76
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,200
The component of vector F that
is perpendicular to this arm.

77
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,560
Well, if this angle--
let me draw a little

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,810
triangle down here.

79
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,610
   

80
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,140
If this is square root of 3,
this is pi over 3 radians, or

81
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,770
60 degrees, and this is a right
angle, it's pi over 3.

82
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,250
I know it's hard to read.

83
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,740
What is this length
right here?

84
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,970
Well, it's a 30-60-90 triangle,
and we know that

85
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,510
this length here-- I mean,
there's a couple of ways you

86
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,410
can think about it.

87
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,420
Now that we know trigonometry,
we know that this is just the

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,170
square root of 3 times the sine
of pi over 3, or the sine

89
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,020
of 60 degrees, and so that
equals the square root of 3.

90
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,790
Sine of pi over 3, or sine
of 60 degrees, is square

91
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,820
root of 3 over 2.

92
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,190
So the square root of 3 times
the square root of 3 is just

93
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,110
3, so that equals 3/2.

94
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,190
So the magnitude of this force
vector that is perpendicular,

95
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,660
the component that is
perpendicular to the arm, is

96
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,580
3/2 newtons, and now we can
figure out the magnitude of

97
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,135
the torque.

98
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,700
It's 3/2 newtons times
10 meters.

99
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,970
So we know the magnitude of the
torque, and I'm being a

100
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,200
little bit more careful with
my notation right now to

101
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,680
remind you that torque actually
is a vector, or you

102
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,520
can almost view it as, they use
this term pseudovector,

103
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,330
because it's kind of a-- well,
anyway, I won't go into that.

104
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,060
So what is the magnitude
of the torque vector?

105
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:31,930
Well, it's 3/2 newtons times the
distance, and remember, I

106
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,830
just drew this vector
here just to

107
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,450
show you the component.

108
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,400
I could just shift the vector
here because this is actually

109
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,550
where the force is
being applied.

110
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,810
You could draw that same vector
here because you can

111
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,730
shift vectors around, so this is
also 3/2 newtons and maybe

112
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,950
that makes it a little
bit clearer.

113
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,600
So it's 3/2 newtons times the
distance that you are from

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,960
your pivot arm, so times
10 meters, and so

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,770
that is equal to what?

116
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,590
15 newton meters.

117
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,940
So the magnitude of the torque
is 15 newton meters.

118
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,720
But all we did now-- and
hopefully this looks a little

119
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,180
bit familiar.

120
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,530
This is what we learned when we
learned moments and torque,

121
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,690
but all we did now is we figured
out the magnitude of

122
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,010
the torque.

123
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,470
But what if we wanted to
know the direction?

124
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,300
And that's where the cross
product comes in.

125
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,080
So what was the definition
of the cross product?

126
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,610
Cross product: r cross F, that
is equal to magnitude of r

127
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,910
times the magnitude of F times
sine of the smallest angle

128
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:41,400
between them times some vector
that is perpendicular to both.

129
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,070
And this is really where it's
going to help, because all of

130
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,660
these right here, these are all
scalar quantities, right?

131
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,380
So these don't specify
the direction.

132
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,990
The direction is completely
specified by this unit vector,

133
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,420
and a unit vector is just a
vector of magnitude 1 that's

134
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,750
pointing in some direction.

135
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,250
Well, look, this cross product,
this part of it, the

136
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,000
part that just gives us
magnitudes, we just calculated

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,200
that using what we knew
before of torques.

138
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,730
The magnitude of our force
vector times sine of theta,

139
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,110
that gave us the component of
the force vector that is

140
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,110
perpendicular to the arm.

141
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,430
And we just multiply that times
the magnitude of r, and

142
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,110
we got the magnitude of the
torque vector, which was 15.

143
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,960
We can leave out the newton
meters for now.

144
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,910
15, and then its direction
is this vector that we

145
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,880
specified by n.

146
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,500
We can call it the
normal vector.

147
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,560
And what do we know
about this vector?

148
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,590
It's perpendicular to both r--
this is r, right-- and it's

149
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,960
perpendicular to F.

150
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,780
And the only way that I
can visualize in our

151
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,990
three-dimensional universe, a
vector that's perpendicular to

152
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,120
both this and this is
if it pops in or out

153
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
of this page, right?

154
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,690
Because both of these vectors
are in the plane that are

155
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,650
defined by our video.

156
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,320
So if I'm a vector that is
perpendicular to your screen,

157
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,350
whatever you're watching this
on, then it's going to be

158
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,050
perpendicular to both
of these vectors.

159
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,150
And how do we figure out if that
vector pops out or pops

160
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,240
into the page?

161
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,035
We use the right hand
rule, right?

162
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:14,340
In the right hand rule, we
take-- r is our index finger,

163
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,410
F is our middle finger, and
whichever direction our thumb

164
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,340
points in tells us whether or
not we are-- the direction of

165
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,980
the cross product.

166
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,930
So let's draw it.

167
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,350
Let me see if I can do a
good job right here.

168
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:43,409
So if that is my index finger,
and you could imagine your

169
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,130
hand sitting on top
of this screen.

170
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,160
So that's my index finger
representing r, and this is my

171
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,610
right hand.

172
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,850
Remember, it only works
with your right hand.

173
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,440
If you do your left hand, it's
going to be the opposite.

174
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,220
And then my middle finger is
going to go in the direction

175
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,460
of F, and then the rest of my
fingers are-- and I encourage

176
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,570
you to draw this.

177
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,300
So if I were to draw it-- let
me draw my nails just so you

178
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,200
know what this is.

179
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,470
So this is the nail on
my index finger.

180
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,470
This is the nail on
my middle finger.

181
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,960
And so in this situation, where
is my thumb going to be?

182
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,550
My thumb is going to
be popping out.

183
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,380
I wish I could-- that's
the nail of my thumb.

184
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,400
Hopefully, that makes
some sense, right?

185
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,870
That's the palm of my hand.

186
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,940
That's the other side of my--
and I could keep drawing, but

187
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,250
hopefully, that makes
some sense.

188
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,220
This is my index finger.

189
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,080
This is the middle finger.

190
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
My thumb is pointing out of
the page, so that tells us

191
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,280
that the torque is actually
pointing out of the page.

192
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,780
So the direction of this unit
vector n is going to be out of

193
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:49,080
the page, and we could signify
that by a circle with a dot.

194
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,950
And I'm almost at my time limit,
and so there you have

195
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:57,980
it: the cross product as it
is applied to torque.

196
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,820
See you in the next video.

197
00:09:59,820 --> 00:09:59,900
