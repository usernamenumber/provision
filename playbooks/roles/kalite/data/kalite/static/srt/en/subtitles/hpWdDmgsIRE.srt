1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:06,525
lets say there are a couple of herbs that believe help prevent the flu.

2
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:10,194
so to test this what we do is we wait for flu season and

3
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:13,026
randomly assign people to three different groups.

4
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:17,763
And over the course of flu season,we have them either in one group taking

5
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:19,853
we have one group taking herb one and the second group taking herb two

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,036
And the third group they take a placebo.

7
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:26,200
And if you don't know what a placebo is, its something thatto the patient or to the person

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,534
participating in it it feels like its doing something that you told them might help them

9
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:34,200
but it does nothing. It could be just a sugar pill so it feels like medicine

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,467
The reason you go through the effort of giving them something is cause often

11
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:40,635
times there is something called the placebo effect where people

12
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:44,582
get better just because they are told that they are being given something that

13
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:45,733
will make them better.

14
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,333
So this right here could just be a sugar pill.

15
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:54,660
And a very small amount of sugar so it really cant affect their

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,678
actual likelyhood of getting the flu.

17
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:02,973
over here we have a table and this is actually called a contingency

18
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:11,067
table, contingency table,contingency table and it has on

19
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,979
it on each group the number that got sick and the number

20
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,733
that did not get sick. And from this we can also calculate the total number

21
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:23,638
So in group 1 we had a total of 120 people and group 2 we had

22
00:01:23,638 --> 00:01:27,667
a total of 30 plus 110 is a 140 people and

23
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,976
the placebo group, that is the group that just got the sugar pill,

24
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:38,667
we had a total of 120 people and we can also tabulate the total number of people that got sick

25
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:39,167
so thats 20 plus 30 that is 50 plus 30 is 80

26
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:49,333
so that is the total column right over here and the total people that didnt get sick

27
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:55,264
over here is 100 and 110 is 210 plus 90 is 300

28
00:01:55,264 --> 00:02:03,298
ant the total people here are 380 both this column and this row should

29
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:05,922
add up to 380. so with this out of the way lets think about how we

30
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:08,522
can use this information in the contingency table and our

31
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:10,519
knowledge of the chi square distribution

32
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,516
to come up with some conclusion.

33
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:16,510
so lets come up with some null hypothesis. so our null hypothesis

34
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,925
is that the herbs do nothing.

35
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:33,043
the herbs do nothing.do nothing. and we have our alternative

36
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:39,451
hypothesis that the herbs do something. herbs do something.

37
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,145
notice i dont even care whether they actually improve.

38
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:45,303
Im just saying they do something. they may even increase your likelyhood

39
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:47,393
of getting the flu. all we are not testing if they are actually good.

40
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:50,643
we are just saying are they different than doing nothing.

41
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:55,798
so like we did with all of our hypothesis tests, lets just assume

42
00:02:55,798 --> 00:03:01,200
the null . we are going to assume the null and given that assumption,

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,108
figure out the problems. figure out if the likelyhood of getting data like this

44
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:09,962
or more extreme is really low.

45
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:11,800
and if it is really low, and if it is really low, we reject it.

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,393
and in this test like in every hypothesis test, we need a significance level and the significance level

47
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:27,200
we care about for whatever reason is 10% or 0.10 thats the significance level we care about.

48
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:36,108
now to do this we need to calculate a chi square statistic for this contingency table. and to do this,

49
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:40,473
we do something very similiar with what we did with the restaurant situation. we figure out assuming

50
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:46,789
the null hypothesis, the expected results in each of these cells in each of these entries as a cell,

51
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:55,800
thats what we do in excel. each of the entries in excel.

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,957
each of the entries in a table.

53
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:09,333
we figure out what each of the values would have been if you do assume the null hypothesis, we find the

54
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,842
square distance from that expected value and you normalize it by the expected value ,take the sum of

55
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:18,000
all those differences and if the square differences are really big, the probability of getting it would

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,177
be really small and maybe we can reject the null hypothesis so lets just figure out how you can get the

57
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:24,591
expected number .

58
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:29,267
so we are assuming that the herbs do nothing. so if the herbs do nothing, we can just figure out that

59
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:35,180
this whole population had nothing happen to them and the herbs were useless and so we can use this population

60
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,938
sample,i shouldnt call this a population sample. we can use this sample right here to figure out the

61
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:49,437
expected number of people who would get sick or not sick so over here, we have 80 out of 380 did not

62
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:55,288
get sick. i should be careful here. i just said population but we havent sampled the whole universe of

63
00:04:55,288 --> 00:05:02,067
people taking this herb so this is a sample. i dont want to confuse you . i am using population in more

64
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:06,248
of a conversational sense rather than a statistical sense. any way in all of our sample, we are using

65
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:10,938
all of the data because we are assuming that there is no difference so we might aswell use all of the

66
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:17,858
data to find the frequency of getting sick and not getting sick so 80 divided by 380 didnot get sick

67
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:29,236
so thats 21 percent. 21 percent didnot get sick. so 21 percent, thats 21 percent of the total and ten

68
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:38,106
if this will be 79 percent if we just subtract so we should divide 300 by 380, we should get 79 percent

69
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:46,744
as well so one would expect the 21 percent of your total based on the total sample righ over here that

70
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:53,849
21 percent should be getting sick and 79 percent should not be getting sick. so lets look at this for

71
00:05:53,849 --> 00:06:00,933
each of the group. if we assume that 21 percent of this 120 people should have gotten sick, what would

72
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:08,570
have been the expected value right over here? lets just multiply 21 percent times a 120. so lets just

73
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:19,252
multiply that times 120 that gets us to 25.3 people. ill just round it. so the expected ill just write

74
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:34,670
this over here. ill do expected in yellow. so the expected right over here . so if you assume that 21

75
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,245
percent of a group would have gotten sick, you would have expected 25.3 people to get sick in group 1

76
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:47,023
in herb 1 group and the remainder will not get sick. so lets just subtract. or i can multiply 79 percent

77
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:59,333
times a 120 either one of them will be good. but let me just take 120 - 25.3 and i get 94.7. so you would

78
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:12,843
have expected 94.7 to not get sick. so this is expected again. expected. expected. 94.7 to not get sick

79
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:18,323
and i also do that for each of those groups. so once again group 2, you would have expected 21 percent

80
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:28,261
to get sick. 21 percent of the total people in that group thats 140 that 29.4 and the remainder that

81
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:38,989
is 140- 29.4 should not have gotten sick. so that gets us this right here. we have 29.4 should have

82
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:51,249
gotten sick if the herbs did nothing. and over here we have 110.6 should not have gotten sick and this

83
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:54,175
is pretty close and by just looking at the result it looks like the herb doesnt do too much relative

84
00:07:54,175 --> 00:08:01,652
to all of the groups combined. and in the placebo group, lets see what happens. we expect 21 percent

85
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:03,648
to get sick of our group of 120 . so thats 25.2 so this right here, actually this would be the same number

86
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:26,915
over here. i said 21 percent but it is actually 21. something. but the group sizes are the same and we

87
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:32,255
should expect the same proportion to get sick ill say 25.3. just to make it consistant. the reason why

88
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,067
i got 25.2 is because i lost some of the trailing decimals over here . but since i had them over here,

89
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:49,800
im gonna use them over here as well and over here, in this group, you would expect 94.7 to get sick.

90
00:08:49,800 --> 00:09:18,788
lets figure out our chi square statistic. so to figure this out, lets get our statistic, our chi square

91
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:24,315
statistic. ill write it like this here for fun. or maybe ill right it as a big X because its really

92
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:31,977
, this random distribution is approximately a chi square distribution. so ill write it like that. and

93
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:34,578
well talk about the degrees of freedom in a second acually let me write it in a curly axis.

94
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:40,000
so you see that some people write with the chi instead of the x. so our chi square statistic over here,

95
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,863
we are literally going to find the squared distance between the observed and the expected divided by

96
00:09:45,863 --> 00:10:14,005
the expected which will be 20-25.3 squared over 25.3 plus 30-29.4 squared over 29.4 + 30 -25.3 squared

97
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:21,018
over 25.3 and then im gonna have to do these over here so let me just continue it you can ignore this

98
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:54,408
h1 over here + 100-94.7 squared over 94.7 +110-110.6 squared over 110.6 and finally 90-94.7 squared over

99
00:10:54,408 --> 00:11:53,062
94.7. so we have (20-25.3) squared /25.3+(30-29.4 )squared/29.4 + (30-25.3)squared/25.3+(100-94.7)squared

100
00:11:53,062 --> 00:12:25,709
/94.7+(110-110.6)squared /110.6+(90-94.7)squared/94.7

101
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:51,715
we get 2.53.so our chi square statistic assuming the null hypothesis is correct is equal to 2.53

102
00:12:51,715 --> 00:13:02,582
next thing we need to do is figure out the degrees of freedom we had while doing this. and ill give you

103
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:15,492
the rule of thumb. that is you have the number of rows. so you have the rows and you have the number

104
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:31,839
of columns so you have 2 rows and 3 columns you dont count the total. so the degrees of freedom is for

105
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,972
your contingency table is the number of rows-1 times the number of columns-1.

106
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:43,310
in our situation we have two rows and 3 columns so that will be 2-1 times 3-1.

107
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:56,400
so that is going to be 2.we have 2 degrees of freedom. the reason why that should have some intuitive

108
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:05,648
sense is that if you assume that you know the total. if you know all of this information, over here,

109
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:13,914
if you know the total information, actually if you knew the parameters of the population as well, but

110
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:21,901
if you knew the total information, and you knew this information or if you knew r-1 of the informations

111
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:31,050
in the rows, the last one can be figured out if you subtract it from the otal. for example, in this situation,

112
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,744
if you knew this, you could easily figure out this. this is not new information.l this is just total

113
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:39,867
- 20. same thing, if you knew this one over here, this one is not new information. similarly,if you knew

114
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:46,654
these two, this one here id not new information. you can calculate this based on the total and everything

115
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:54,038
else. so that's the sense as to why the degrees of freedom are the columns - 1 times the rows - 1 .

116
00:14:54,038 --> 00:15:07,067
so any way, our chi square statistic has two degrees of freedom. so remember our alpha value is 10 %.

117
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:21,205
so we are going to figure out what our critical chi square statistic is that gives us an alpha of 10

118
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:26,200
% and if this is more extreme than that, if the probability of getting this is even less than that critical

119
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:33,140
statistic, we can reject the null hpothesis, and if it is not more extreme, we will not reject the null

120
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:41,067
hypothesis. so what we need to do is to figure out what the chi square distribution is and 2 degrees

121
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:47,444
of freedom, what is our critical chi square statistic. so lets just go back, we have two degrees of freedom

122
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:58,404
here and we have a care about a significance level of 10 % so our critical chi square value is 4.60.

123
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:03,837
another way to visualize this is if you look at a kai square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom,

124
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:30,667
that is the blue one over here, at a value of 4.60, the probability of getting something atleast that

125
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:40,989
extreme is 10%.this is what we care about. If the kai square distribution that we care about falls into

126
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:53,714
this rejection region, then we reject our null hypothesis but our kai square statistic is only 2.53 so

127
00:16:53,714 --> 00:17:05,324
it is sitting some place right over here. so its actually not that crazy to get it if you assume the null hypothesis. so based

128
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:15,169
on the data we have right now, we cant reject the null hypothesis. we dont know for fact that the herbs

129
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:25,533
do nothing but we cant say that they do something. so we are not going to reject it.but from this point

130
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:34,534
of view , it doesnt seem like the herbs are different from each other and one of the herbs is obviously a placebo.
