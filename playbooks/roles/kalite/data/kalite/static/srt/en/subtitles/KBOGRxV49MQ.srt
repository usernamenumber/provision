00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:22,092
in our last video, we looked at simple designs of beam and arch bridges.

2
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,014
Now let's move on to the modern edge

3
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:28,680
Truss bridge

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,072
Truss Bridge make use of a large frame, called Truss

5
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:34,670
It sets on the top or bellow the bridge deck.

6
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,367
In this case, it is on top.

7
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:39,079
While it may seem that it only adds weight to the deck.

8
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,105
Truss distributes the load through frame,

9
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:46,516
so the deck does not experience as much of load.

10
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:49,043
each segment of the Truss experience different loads of

11
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:51,597
either tension or compression

12
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:53,710
we apply two equal loads to the deck,

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,213
and calculated the loads to each segment

14
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:59,924
which are shown as percentages of the total load.

15
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:03,870
you can see that the largest loads are on the end and the top segment.

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,898
while the middle segments have none.

17
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:09,880
remember that, when we do the compression tests,

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,091
spoiler alert!

19
00:01:17,873 --> 00:01:21,477
Let's see if this convict will get shot up from this Trust job...

20
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:23,634
so how do you think the truss will break?

21
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:27,088
Discuss!

22
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,392
Thanks for coming, Yoda.

23
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:31,738
I love your work.

24
00:01:34,114 --> 00:01:37,784
As you can see, the outer segments to the Truss are the first to break,

25
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:40,941
as they are handling the largest part of the load.

26
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:45,399
The diagram showed the outer and the top segments had the same loads.

27
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,133
But why didn't the top break?

28
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:50,839
That's because the top pieces are lined along the grain of the wood.

29
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:54,276
woods are stronger in that direction

30
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:58,249
Adding the truss allowed the same deck length to hold 32 pounds.

31
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:03,101
which is 25% stronger than the beam bridge of the same length.

32
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:09,559
The final type of the bridge we will discuss, is the iconic suspension bridge.

33
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:14,705
Although the only suspension bridge around us is less than iconic...

34
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:17,092
But the same principles apply.

35
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:20,313
Suspension bridges utilize thick steel cables

36
00:02:20,313 --> 00:02:24,677
which support the deck and transfer the loads to the towers and to the anckers at the end of the bridge.

37
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:34,662
Supporting cables are used to suspend the bridge deck from the main cables.

38
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:39,083
the main cables and the supporting cables of the bridge are always under tension.

39
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,393
the cables transfer the load to the towers.

40
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:43,192
which experience compression.

41
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:47,865
and also to the anckers at the end of the bridge.

42
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:50,099
in our model, we used wires for the main cables, and supporting cables.

43
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:59,072
some of the constructions are not ideal, because it is difficult to simulate some of the joining points and anckers on the small scale.

44
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:08,076
For this test, we need the full cast of characters.

45
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:11,097
The miss fits. versus, the bike gang!

46
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:20,781
Oh, there's this crazy guy again! The loss of the crazy guy...

47
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:25,592
As forces apply, the cables transfer the load out to the towers and to the end.

48
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:28,995
and the first transportation maintains the integrity of the deck

49
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:32,735
So even when it does break, it doesn't really launch anyone!

50
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:34,147
unfortunately.

51
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,251
I really wanted to see the crazy guy get launched.

52
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,245
This bridge supported 32 pounds.

53
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:42,734
Which is the same as the Truss Bridge.

54
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:48,742
The Truss and the Suspension bridges were stronger than the long beam bridges

55
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,784
but weaker than the arch bridge

56
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:52,908
this may have been unexpected

57
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:57,323
but the real advantage of the truss and suspension bridges

58
00:03:57,323 --> 00:04:00,802
are that they can spend longer distances than the beam and arch bridges
