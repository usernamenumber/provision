1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,140
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,410
We've done a lot of
work with vectors.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,050
In a lot of the problems, when
we launch something into—In

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,920
the projectile motion problems,
or when you were

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,620
doing the incline plane
problems. I always gave you a

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,370
vector, like I would draw
a vector like this.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,440
I would say something
has a velocity of

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,420
10 meters per second.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,900
It's at a 30 degree angle.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,060
And then I would break it up
into the x and y components.

11
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,550
So if I called this vector v, I
would use a notation, v sub

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,910
x, and the v sub x would have
been this vector right here.

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,200
v sub x would've been this
vector down here.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,740
The x component of the vector.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,280
   

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,575
And then v sub y would have been
the y component of the

17
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:49,800
vector, and it would have
been this vector.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,390
So this was v sub x,
this was v sub y.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,610
And hopefully by now, it's
second nature of how we would

20
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,260
figure these things out. v sub
x would be 10 times cosine of

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,860
this angle.

22
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,200
10 cosine of 30 degrees, which I
think is square root of 3/2,

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,890
but we're not worried about
that right now.

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,810
And v sub y would be 10 times
the sine of that angle.

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,740
This hopefully should be
second nature to you.

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,560
If it's not, you can just go
through SOH-CAH-TOA and say,

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,180
well, the sine of 30 degrees
is the opposite of the

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,890
hypotenuse.

29
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,820
And you would get
back to this.

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,030
But we've reviewed all of that,
and you should review

31
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,160
the initial vector videos.

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,590
But what I want you to do now,
because this is useful for

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,430
simple projectile motion
problems-- But once we start

34
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,700
dealing with more complicated
vectors-- and maybe we're

35
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,190
dealing with multi-dimensional
of vectors, three-dimensional

36
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,170
vectors, or we start doing
linear algebra, where we do

37
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,790
n-dimensional vectors—we
need a coherent way, an

38
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,450
analytical way, instead of
having to always draw a

39
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,660
picture of representing
vectors.

40
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,700
So what we do is, we use
something I call, and I think

41
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,630
everyone calls it, unit
vector notation.

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,860
So what does that mean?

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,530
So we define these
unit vectors.

44
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,070
Let me draw some axes.

45
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,720
And it's important to keep in
mind, this might seem a little

46
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,699
confusing at first, but this
is no different than what

47
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,350
we've been doing in our physics
problem so far.

48
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:20,980
Let me draw the axes
right there.

49
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:29,600
Let's say that this is 1,
this is 0, this is 2.

50
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,450
0, 1, 2.

51
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,410
I don't know if must been
writing an Arabic or

52
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,820
something, going backwards.

53
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,640
This is 0, 1, 2,
that's not 20.

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,240
And then let's say this is 1,
this is 2, in the y direction.

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,200
I'm going to define what I call
the unit vectors in two

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,020
dimensions.

57
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,720
So I'm going to first
define a vector.

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,970
I'll call this vector i.

59
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,220
And this is the vector.

60
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,175
   

61
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:02,000
It just goes straight in the x
direction, has no y component,

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,140
and it has the magnitude of 1.

63
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,450
And so this is i.

64
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,470
We denote the unit vector
by putting this little

65
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,620
cap on top of it.

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,540
There's multiple notations.

67
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,480
Sometimes in the book, you'll
see this i without the cap,

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,410
and it's just boldface.

69
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,370
There's some other notations.

70
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,640
But if you see i, and not in
the imaginary number sense,

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,255
you should realize that that's
the unit vector.

72
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:28,960
It has magnitude 1 and it's
completely in the x direction.

73
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,200
And I'm going to define another
vector, and that one

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,710
is called j.

75
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,750
And that is the same thing
but in the y direction.

76
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,200
That is the vector j.

77
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,600
You put a little cap over it.

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,290
So why did I do this?

79
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, if I'm dealing with
two dimensions.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,325
And as later we'll see in three
dimensions, so there

81
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,090
will actually be a third
dimension and we'll call that

82
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,070
k, but don't worry about
that right now.

83
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,480
But if we're dealing in two
dimensions, we can define any

84
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,800
vector in terms of some sum
of these two vectors.

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,270
So how does that work?

86
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,780
Well, this vector here,
let's call it v.

87
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,860
This vector, v, is
the sum of its x

88
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,200
component plus its y component.

89
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,450
When you add vectors, you
can put them head

90
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,600
to tail like this.

91
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,320
And that's the sum.

92
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,589
So hopefully knowing what we
already know, we knew that the

93
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,079
vector, v, is equal to its x

94
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,910
component plus its y component.

95
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,270
When you add vectors, you
essentially just put

96
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,080
them head to tails.

97
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,840
And then the resulting sum
is where you end up.

98
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,340
It would be if you added this
vector, and then you put this

99
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,170
tail to this head.

100
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:37,910
And you end up there.

101
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,480
So you end up there.

102
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,300
So that's the vector.

103
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,820
So can we define v sub x as some
multiple of i, of this

104
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,160
unit vector?

105
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,070
Well, sure.

106
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,610
v sub x completely goes
in the x direction.

107
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,590
But it doesn't have
a magnitude of 1.

108
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,150
It has a magnitude of 10
cosine 30 degrees.

109
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,870
So its magnitude is ten.

110
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,340
Let me draw the unit
vector up here.

111
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,640
This is the unit vector i.

112
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,550
It's going to look something
like this and this.

113
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,120
So v sub x is in the exact same
direction, and it's just

114
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,820
a scaled version of
this unit vector.

115
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,120
And what multiple is it
of that unit vector?

116
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,320
Well, the unit vector has
a magnitude of 1.

117
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,720
This has a magnitude of 10
cosine of 30 degrees.

118
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,130
I think that's like, 5
square roots of 3, or

119
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,070
something like that.

120
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:34,200
So we can write v sub x-- I keep
switching colors to keep

121
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,850
things interesting.

122
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:42,680
We can write v sub x is equal
to 10 cosine of 30 degrees

123
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,610
times-- that's the degrees
--times the unit vector i--

124
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,070
let me stay in that color, so
you don't confused --times the

125
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,420
unit vector i.

126
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,010
Does that make sense?

127
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,970
Well, the unit vector i goes in
the exact same direction.

128
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,980
But the x component of this
vector is just a lot longer.

129
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,630
It's 10 cosine 30
degrees long.

130
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,080
And that's equal to-- cosine of
30 degrees is square root

131
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,580
of 3/2 --so that's 5 square
roots of 3 i.

132
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,150
Similary, we can write the y
component of this vector as

133
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,400
some multiple of j.

134
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,110
   

135
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,490
So we could say v sub y, the y
component-- Well, what is sine

136
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,250
of 30 degrees?

137
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,400
Sine of 30 degrees is 1/2.

138
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,470
1/2 times 10, so this is 5.

139
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,740
So the y component goes
completely in the y direction.

140
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,880
So it's just going to be a
multiple of this vector j, of

141
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,410
the unit vector j.

142
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,350
And what multiple is it?

143
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,240
Well, it has length 5,
while the unit vector

144
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,550
has just length 1.

145
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,590
So it's just 5 times
the unit vector j.

146
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,240
So how can we write vector v?

147
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,030
Well, we know the vector v is
the sum of its x component and

148
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,930
its y component.

149
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,840
And we also know, so this
is a whole vector v.

150
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,880
What's its x component?

151
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,130
Its x component can be
written as a multiple

152
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,710
of the x unit vector.

153
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,490
That's that right there.

154
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,080
So you can write it as
5 square roots of 3

155
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,330
i plus its y component.

156
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,530
So what's its y component?

157
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,880
Well, its y component is just
a multiple of the y unit

158
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,160
vector, which is called
j, with the little

159
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,680
funny hat on top.

160
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,730
And that's just this.

161
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,050
It's 5 times j.

162
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,970
   

163
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,770
So what we've done now, by
defining these unit vectors--

164
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,390
And I can switch this
color just so you

165
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,640
remember this is i.

166
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,450
This unit vector is this.

167
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,860
Using unit vectors in two
dimensions, and we can

168
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,140
eventually do them in multiple
dimensions, we can

169
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:55,130
analytically express any
two dimensional vector.

170
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,680
Instead of having to always draw
it like we did before,

171
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,710
and having to break out
its components and

172
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,810
always do it visually.

173
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,660
We can stay in analytical mode
and non graphical mode.

174
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,930
And what makes this very useful
is that if I can write

175
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,480
a vector in this format, I can
add them and subtract them

176
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,830
without having to resort
to visual means.

177
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,080
And what do I mean by that?

178
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,180
   

179
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,710
So if I had to find some vector
a, is equal to, I don't

180
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,870
know, 2i plus 3j.

181
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,980
And I have some other
vector b.

182
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
This little arrow just
means it's a vector.

183
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,409
Sometimes you'll see it
as a whole arrow.

184
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:52,800
As, I don't know, 10i plus 2j.

185
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,080
If I were to say what's
the sum of these two

186
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,650
vectors a plus b?

187
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,460
Before we had this unit vector
notation, we would have to

188
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,320
draw them, and put them
heads to tails.

189
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,300
And you had to do it visually,
and it would take

190
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,870
you a lot of time.

191
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,580
But once you have it broken up
into the x and y components,

192
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,170
you can just separately add
the x and y components.

193
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:18,330
So vector a plus vector b,
that's just 2 plus 10 times i

194
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,660
plus 3 plus 2 times j.

195
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,820
And that's equal
to 12i plus 5j.

196
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,790
And something you might want to
do, maybe I'll do it in the

197
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,820
future video, is actually draw
out these two vectors and add

198
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,420
them visually.

199
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,210
And you'll see that you
get this exact answer.

200
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,050
And as we go into further
videos, or future videos,

201
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,590
you'll see how this is super
useful once we start doing

202
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,090
more complicated physics
problems, or once we start

203
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,140
doing physics with calculus.

204
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,840
Anyway, I'm about to run out
of time on the ten minutes.

205
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,090
So I'll see you in
the next video.
