1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,180
Let's say I have
the subspace v.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,730
And this is a subspace and we
learned all about subspaces in

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,510
the last video.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,240
And it's equal to the span
of some set of vectors.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,910
And I showed in that video that
the span of any set of

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,710
vectors is a valid subspace.

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,310
   

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,910
It's going to be the span of v1,
v2, all the way, so it's

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,030
going to be n vectors.

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,100
So each of these are vectors.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,920
Now let me also say that all of
these vectors are linearly

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,970
independent.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:43,850
So v1, v2, all the way to vn,
this set of vectors are

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,100
linearly independent.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,370
   

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,800
Now before I kind of give you
the punchline, let's review

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
what exactly span meant.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,280
Span meant that this set, this
subspace, represents all of

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,380
the possible linear
combinations of

21
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,800
all of these vectors.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,060
So you know, I could have all of
the combinations for all of

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,880
the different c's.

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:18,600
So c1 times v1 plus c2 times v2,
all the way to cn times vn

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,405
for all of the possible c's
and the real numbers.

26
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:24,140
If you take all of the
possibilities of these and you

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,610
put all of those vectors into
a set, that is the span and

28
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,540
that's what we're defining
the subspace v as.

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,810
Now, the definition of linear
independence meant that the

30
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:44,690
only solution to c1, v1, plus
c2, v2 plus all the way to cn,

31
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,920
vn, that the only solution to
this equally the 0 vector--

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,650
maybe I should put a little
vector sign up there-- is when

33
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,220
all of these terms
are equal to 0.

34
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,890
c1 is equal to c2, is equal
to all of these.

35
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,570
All of them are equal to 0.

36
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,660
Or kind of a more common sense
way to think of it is that you

37
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,670
can't represent any one of these
vectors as a combination

38
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,990
of the other vectors.

39
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,660
Now, if both of these conditions
are true that the

40
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,430
span of this set of vectors is
equal to this subspace or

41
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,950
creates this subspace or it
spans this subspace, and that

42
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,560
all of these vectors are
linearly independent, then we

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,560
can say that the set of
vectors-- maybe we call this,

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,450
we could call this
set of vectors s.

45
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:40,140
Where we say s is equal to v1,
v2, all the way to vn.

46
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,210
It's equal to that
set of vectors.

47
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,780
We can then say and this
is the punchline.

48
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:54,280
We can then say that S, the
set S is a basis for v.

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,580
And this is the definition
I wanted to make.

50
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,790
If something is a basis for a
set, that means that those

51
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,230
vectors, if you take the span
of those vectors, you can

52
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,390
construct-- you can get to any
of the factors in that

53
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,820
subspace and that those
vectors are linearly

54
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,860
independent.

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,280
So there's a couple of ways
to think about it.

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,330
One is there's a lot of things
that might span for something.

57
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,480
For example, if this spans for
v, then so would-- let me add

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,870
another vector.

59
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,060
Let me define another set.

60
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,750
Let me define set T to be
all of set S: v1, v2,

61
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,010
all the way to vn.

62
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,150
But it also contains
this other vector.

63
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,970
I'm going to call it the
v special vector.

64
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,730
So it's going to be essentially,
the set S plus

65
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,120
one more vector.

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,790
Where this vector I'm just
saying is equal to v1 plus v2.

67
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,800
So clearly, this is not a
linearly independent set.

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:04,355
But if I had asked you what the
span of T is, the span of

69
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:09,520
T is still going to be
this subspace, v.

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,550
But I have this extra vector
in here that made it

71
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,190
non-linearly independent.

72
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,500
This set is not linearly
independent.

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,250
So T is linearly dependent.

74
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:31,030
So in this case, T is
not a basis for v.

75
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,450
And I had showed you this
example because the way my

76
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,820
head thinks about basis is,
the basis is really the

77
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,510
minimum set of vectors that I
need, the minimum set-- and

78
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,180
I'll write this down.

79
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,250
This isn't a formal definition,
but I view a

80
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,300
basis-- let me switch colors--
as really the-- let me get a

81
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,120
good color here.

82
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,960
As a basis is the minimum-- I'll
put it in quotes because

83
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,620
I haven't defined that.

84
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:07,470
The minimum set of vectors that
spans the space that it's

85
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,810
a basis of, spans
the subspace.

86
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,570
   

87
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,680
So in this case, this is the
minimum set of vectors.

88
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,360
And I'm not going to prove it
just yet, but you can see

89
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,550
that, look.

90
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,950
This set of vectors right
here, it does span the

91
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,440
subspace, but it's clearly not
the minimum set of vectors.

92
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,560
Because the span of this thing,
I could still remove

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,330
this last vector here.

94
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,410
I could still remove that guy
and still-- and then the span

95
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:44,230
of what's left over is still
going to span my subspace v.

96
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,140
So this guy right here
was redundant.

97
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,300
In a basis, you have
a no redundancy.

98
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,050
Each one of these guys is needed
to be able to construct

99
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,520
any of the vectors in
the subspace v.

100
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,770
Let me do some examples.

101
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,700
   

102
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:12,550
So let's just take some
vectors here.

103
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,450
Let's say I had to find
my set of vectors, and

104
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,170
I'll deal in r2.

105
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,135
So let's say I have
the vector 2, 3.

106
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:25,990
   

107
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,610
Let's say I have the
other vector 7, 0.

108
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,390
So first of all, let's just
think about the span, the span

109
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,620
of this set of vectors.

110
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,090
This is a set of vectors.

111
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,450
So what's the span of S?

112
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,360
What's all of the linear
combinations of this?

113
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,470
Well, let's see if
it's all of r2.

114
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,670
So if it's all of r2 that means
the linear combination

115
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,700
of this could be-- we could
always construct anything in

116
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,270
r2 with the linear combination
of this.

117
00:06:53,270 --> 00:07:00,920
So if we have c1 times 2,
3 plus c2 times 7, 0.

118
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,240
If it is true that this spans
all of r2, then we should be

119
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,280
able to construct-- we should
always be able find a c1 and a

120
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,140
c2 to construct any
point in r2.

121
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,000
And let's see if we
can show that.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,650
So we get 2c1 plus 7c2
is equal to x1.

123
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,810
And then we get 3c1 plus 0c2.

124
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,280
Plus 0 is equal to x2.

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,970
And if we take this second
equation and divide both sides

126
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:37,710
by 3 we get c1 is equal
to x2 over 3.

127
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,920
And then if we substitute that
back into this first equation,

128
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,210
we get 2/3-- I'm just
substituting c1 in there.

129
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,100
So 2/3 x2.

130
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:57,140
2 times x2 over 3 is 2/3 x2.
plus 7c2 is equal to x1.

131
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,160
And then, what can we do?

132
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,090
We can subtract the 2/3
x2 from both sides.

133
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,000
Let me do it right here.

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,390
So we get 7c2 is equal
to x1 minus 2/3 x2.

135
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,000
Divide both sides of this
by 7 and you get c2.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,840
Let me do it in yellow.

137
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:22,890
You get c2 is equal to x1 over
7 minus 2 over 21 x2.

138
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:29,670
So if you've given me any x1 and
any x2 where either x1 or

139
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,980
x2 are a member of the real
numbers, we're talking about--

140
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,799
well, everything we're going to
be dealing with right now

141
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,350
is real numbers.

142
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,159
You give me any two
real numbers.

143
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,190
I take my x2 divided by 3 and
I'll give you your c1.

144
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,380
And I'll take the x1 divided
by 7 and subtract

145
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,410
2/21 times your x2.

146
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,780
And I'll get you your c2.

147
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,830
This will never break.

148
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,410
There's no division
by any of these.

149
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,390
You don't have to worry about
these equaling a 0.

150
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,930
These two formulas
will always work.

151
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,640
So you give me any x1 and any
x2, I can always find

152
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,360
you a c1 or a c2.

153
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,730
Which is essentially finding a
linear combination that will

154
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,070
equal your vector.

155
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,020
So the span of S is r2.

156
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:15,360
   

157
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,250
Now the second question is, is
are these two vectors linearly

158
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,910
independent?

159
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,690
And linear independence means
that the only solution to the

160
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,450
equation c-- let me
switch colors.

161
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,810
The only solution to the
equation c1 times the first

162
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:40,790
vector plus c2 times the second
vector equaling the 0

163
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,660
vector, that the only solution
to this is when both

164
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,970
of these equal 0.

165
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,870
So let's see if that's true.

166
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,780
We've already solved for it, so
if x1-- in this case, x1 is

167
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,220
equal to 0 and x2
is equal to 0.

168
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,500
This is just a special
case where I'm making

169
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,300
them equal to 0 vector.

170
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,340
If I want to get the 0 vector,
c1 is equal to 0/3.

171
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,140
So c1 must be equal to 0.

172
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,130
And c2 is equal to 0/7
minus 2/21 times 0.

173
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,620
So c2 must also be equal to 0.

174
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,540
So the only solution to this
was settings both of these

175
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,040
guys equal to 0.

176
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,190
So S is also a linearly
independent set.

177
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,700
   

178
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,240
So it spans r2, it's linearly
independent.

179
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,610
So we can say definitively, that
S-- that the set S, the

180
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:46,280
set of vectors S is
a basis for r2.

181
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,180
Now, is this the only
basis for r2?

182
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,530
Well I could draw a trivially
simple vector, set of vectors.

183
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,310
I could do this one.

184
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,950
Let me call it T.

185
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:10,290
If I define T to be the set 1, 0
and 0, 1, does this span r2?

186
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,970
Let's say I want to generate
the-- I want to

187
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,420
get to x1 and x2.

188
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,820
How can I construct that out
of these two vectors?

189
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:27,850
Well, if I always just do x1
times 0, 1 plus x2 times 0, 1,

190
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,970
that'll always give me x1, x2.

191
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,380
So this definitely
does span r2.

192
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,960
   

193
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,670
Is it linearly independent?

194
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,260
I could show it to you.

195
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,880
If you wanted to make this
equal to the 0 vector.

196
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,630
   

197
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,900
If this is a 0 and this is 0,
then this has to be a 0 and

198
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,330
this has to be a 0.

199
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,360
And that's kind of obvious.

200
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,810
There's no way that you could
get one of the other vectors

201
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,700
by some multiple of
the other one.

202
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,810
There's no way you could get a
1 here by multiplying this by

203
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,640
anything and vice versa.

204
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,225
So it's also linearly
independent.

205
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:09,960
   

206
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,260
And the whole reason why I
showed you this is because I

207
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,300
wanted to show you that look,
this set T spans r2.

208
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,620
It's also linearly independent,
so T is also a

209
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:27,210
basis for r2.

210
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,600
And I wanted to show you this
to show that if I look at a

211
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,980
vector subspace and r2 is a
valid subspace of itself.

212
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,640
You can verify that.

213
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,880
But if I have a subspace, it
doesn't have just one basis.

214
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,290
It could have multiple bases.

215
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,450
In fact, it normally
has infinite bases.

216
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,880
So in this case, S is a valid
basis and T is also a valid

217
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,580
basis for r2.

218
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,410
And actually, just so you know
what T is, the situation here,

219
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,020
this is called a
standard basis.

220
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,560
This is the standard basis.

221
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,850
And this is what you're used
to dealing with in just

222
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,550
regular calculus or
physics class.

223
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,450
And if you remember from physics
class, this is the

224
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,830
unit vector i and then this
is the unit vector j.

225
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,180
And it's the standard basis for
two-dimensional Cartesian

226
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,320
coordinates.

227
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,990
What's useful about a basis is
that you can always-- and it's

228
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,310
not just true of the standard
basis, is that you can

229
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,940
represent any vector
in your subspace.

230
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,480
You can represent any vector
in your subspace by some

231
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,050
unique combination of the
vectors in your basis.

232
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,220
So let me show you that.

233
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:47,220
So let's say that the set v1,
v2, all the way to vn, let's

234
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:57,240
say that this is a basis for--
I don't know-- just some

235
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,480
subspace U.

236
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,730
So this is a subspace.

237
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,970
   

238
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,720
So that means that these guys
are linearly independent.

239
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,640
And also means that the span of
these guys, or all of the

240
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,880
linear combinations of these
vectors, will get you all of

241
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,260
the vectors, all of the possible
components, all of

242
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,950
the difference members of U.

243
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,370
Now what I want to show you is
each member of U can only be

244
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,300
uniquely defined by a unique set
of-- a unique combination

245
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,910
of these guys.

246
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,520
Let me be clear about that.

247
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,440
Let's say my vector a is a
member of our subspace U.

248
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,370
That means that a can be
represented by some linear

249
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,730
combination of these guys.

250
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,230
These guys span U.

251
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,950
So that means that we can
represent our vector a as

252
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,010
being c1 times v1 plus
c2 times v2.

253
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,430
These are vectors.

254
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,930
All the way to cn times vn.

255
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,860
Now I want to show you that this
is a unique combination.

256
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:06,700
And to show that I'm going to
prove by contradiction.

257
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,270
Let's say that there's
another combination.

258
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,080
Let's say I could also represent
a by some other

259
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,410
combination, d1 times v2 plus
d2 times v2 plus all the way

260
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,940
to dn times vn.

261
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,130
Now, what happens if I
subtract a from a?

262
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,410
I'm going to get the 0 vector.

263
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,160
Let me subtract these
two things.

264
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,880
If I subtract a from
a, a minus a is

265
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,970
clearly the 0 vector.

266
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,250
It's clearly the 0 vector and
if I subtract this side from

267
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,250
that side, what do we get?

268
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,720
I'll do it in a different
color.

269
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:49,390
We get c1 minus d1 times v1 plus
c2 minus d2 times v2, all

270
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,400
the way to-- I'm at the point on
my board where it starts to

271
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,260
malfunction.

272
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:00,510
All the way to c-- you can't
see it. cn minus vn.

273
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,760
It's showing up somehow.

274
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,890
   

275
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,070
cn minus-- no, it's
messing me up.

276
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,670
Let me rewrite it on the left
right here where it's less

277
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,050
likely to mess up.

278
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,580
The 0 vector, I'll write
it like that.

279
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:23,920
Is equal to c1 minus d1 times
v1 plus all the way up to cn

280
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,740
minus dn times vn.

281
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,570
I just subtracted the
vector by itself.

282
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,510
Now, I told you that
these are a basis.

283
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,520
There's two things that-- when
you say a basis, it says that

284
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,270
the span of these guys
makes the subspace.

285
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,970
Or the span of these guys
is the subspace.

286
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,040
And it also tells you that
these guys are linearly

287
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,360
independent.

288
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,530
So if they're linearly
independent, the only solution

289
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,120
to this equation-- this is just
a constant times v1 plus

290
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,660
another constant times
v2, all the way to a

291
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,250
constant times vn.

292
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,730
The only solution to this
equation is if each of these

293
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,490
constants equal 0.

294
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,990
So all of those constants
have to be equal to 0.

295
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,179
Over here before it messed up,
this has to equal 0, this has

296
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:10,910
to equal 0.

297
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,440
That was a definition of
linear independence.

298
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,220
And we know that this is a
linearly independent set.

299
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,660
So if all of those constants are
equal to 0, then we know

300
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,170
that c1-- if this is equal to 0,
then c1 is equal to d1, c2

301
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,690
is equal to d2, all the way
to cn is equal to dn.

302
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,660
So by the fact that it's
linearly independent, all of

303
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,250
these-- each of these constants
have to be equal to

304
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,540
each other.

305
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,410
And that's our contradiction.

306
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,280
I assume they're different, but
the linear independence

307
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,370
forced them to be the same.

308
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,380
So if you have a basis for some
subspace, any member of

309
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,060
that subspace can be uniquely
determined by a unique

310
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,870
combination of those vectors.

311
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:57,370
And just to hit the point home,
I told you that this was

312
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,270
a basis for r2.

313
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,130
And my next question is,
and I just want to kind

314
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,980
of backtrack a bit.

315
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,120
If I just added another vector
here, if I just added the

316
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,310
vector 1, 0, is S now
a basis for r2?

317
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,170
Well no, it clearly will
continue to span r2, but this

318
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,210
guy is redundant.

319
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,330
This guy is in r2.

320
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,760
And I already told you that
these two guys alone span r2.

321
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,630
That anything in r2 can be
represented by a linear

322
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,800
combination of these two guys.

323
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,160
This guy is clearly in r2, so
he can be represented by a

324
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,000
linear combination of
these two guys.

325
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,660
So therefore, this is not a
linearly independent set.

326
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,085
This is linearly dependent.

327
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:41,830
   

328
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,250
And because it's literally
dependent, I have redundant

329
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,250
information here.

330
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,700
And then this would no
longer be a basis.

331
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,770
So in order for these to be a
basis I kind of have to create

332
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,620
the minimum set of vectors that
can span, or the most

333
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,500
efficient set of vectors that
can span, in this case, r2.

334
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,969
