00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:01,415
In the last video,

2
00:00:01,415 --> 00:00:05,039
I realized that I made a mistake near the end,

3
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:05,933
but it's not a good one

4
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:07,440
because I copied down the wrong number

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,400
and then that led to the rest of

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,658
the problem not having the right values.

7
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:12,749
We figured out that the vertical component

8
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:16,040
of our velocity earlier in the video is

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,273
-26.03 m/s.

10
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:21,711
But then I somehow -

11
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:23,028
something happened in my brain-

12
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:25,533
and it became -29.03,

13
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:28,026
so this is not -29.03,

14
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:31,993
this is -26.03 m/s.

15
00:00:32,547 --> 00:00:33,878
So the total velocity, we should have

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,585
26.03^2 over here,

17
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:39,980
and then if we evaluate that,

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,138
and I just did it on my calculator,

19
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:44,421
26.03^2 + 5.61 -

20
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:45,800
actually I did it wrong again,

21
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:48,692
so let me redo it-

22
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:55,585
so 26.03^2 + 5.21^2 under the radical

23
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:58,354
gives us 26.55.

24
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:03,975
So this right over here should be 26.55 m/s.

25
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:11,040
So that is the magnitude of our final velocity.

26
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:13,647
So that is the magnitude

27
00:01:13,647 --> 00:01:15,675
of our total final velocity.

28
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,356
And the angle, since this is not 29.03,

29
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:21,225
this is 26.03,

30
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:23,894
we can say that the tangent of this angle, theta,

31
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:28,067
tangent of theta is equal to

32
00:01:34,236 --> 00:01:36,575
the length of this vector right over here,

33
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:39,467
which is the opposite side, 26.03

34
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,589
over the length of this vector here,

35
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:43,631
which is 5.21,

36
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:46,364
or we could say,

37
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:46,959
we could say,

38
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,873
if we take the inverse tangent

39
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:49,656
of both sides of this,

40
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:51,217
that the angle is equal to

41
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:54,314
the inverse tangent, or the arctangent of

42
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:58,067
26.03/5.21

43
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,024
and that gives us -

44
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:03,902
we have the inverse tangent of

45
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:14,564
26.03/5.21 - gives us roughly 78.7 degrees.

46
00:02:14,564 --> 00:02:18,067
So the angle here is 78.7 degrees.

47
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,579
And it's below the horizontal,

48
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,705
so we can say that the vector,

49
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:27,069
the final velocity vector,

50
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,595
has a magnitude of 26.55 m/s

51
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:34,840
at a direction of 78.7 degrees

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,588
below the horizontal,

53
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:37,421
so I hope I didn't confuse you

54
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:38,462
too much with that

55
00:02:38,462 --> 99:59:59,999
mistake at the end of that video.
