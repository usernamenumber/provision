1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:03,088
Any economy is a super complicated thing

2
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:04,203
So what I am going to do in this video

3
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:05,735
is a super over simplification.

4
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:07,732
But it is just a way of thinking about things.

5
00:00:07,732 --> 00:00:09,218
In particular, I want to think about

6
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:12,005
why good economies tend to be associated

7
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:14,884
with a moderate level of inflation.

8
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,370
And that will also help inform us

9
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,670
when we are thinking about Stagflation

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,808
when we have inflation with a bad economy.

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,732
So, a good economy, employment is up

12
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,218
And because employment is up,

13
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:26,633
employees have more negotiating power

14
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:28,305
There's more people who want to hire them,

15
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:30,302
there is fewer people who wants their jobs,

16
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:32,673
And so wages will go up.

17
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,225
And since you have more people with jobs,

18
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:36,943
And those who have jobs are being paid more,

19
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:39,404
You can imagine that demand will also go up.

20
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:42,051
There is more people that have money in their pockets.

21
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,466
And if demand goes up,

22
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:48,228
Then companies, or you can think of them as factories,

23
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:49,714
But it can also be services,

24
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:52,593
Then everything will be utilized more.

25
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:53,801
And if things are utilized more,

26
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:56,959
Then the companies or those factories

27
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,120
or whatever you want to think of them,

28
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,999
They are going to have more profit.

29
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:05,411
On top of that, if they get close to fully utilization,

30
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:07,361
Or if they see that fully utilization is down the road,

31
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:09,869
They are going to want to invest more.

32
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,866
And, they could actually push off that

33
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,956
utilization and get more profit,

34
00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:17,485
by maybe raising prices.

35
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:19,668
So this is where that moderate of inflation,

36
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:21,572
really shows up.

37
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:23,058
The fact that there is more demand,

38
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:24,312
the fact that you can produce a little bit more,

39
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:26,401
and it could raise prices a little bit more.

40
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:28,073
So this is where,

41
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:30,024
the moderate level of inflation shows up.

42
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,742
And there is a little bit of a negative feedback,

43
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:33,182
if price goes up.

44
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:36,575
It will inhibit demand a little bit.

45
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:38,522
And that is why it is moderate inflation,

46
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:41,013
not some type of crazy inflationary spiral here.

47
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,840
But the net effect of more utilization,

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,651
and more investment

49
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:48,484
is going to be an increase in supply.

50
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,456
is going to be an increase in supply.

51
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:52,497
And once again,

52
00:01:52,497 --> 00:01:54,799
And this is kind of e-con 101,

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,218
If supply goes up, price will also have an

54
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:03,293
inhibitory impact on price.

55
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:07,036
So let me draw, so we get all the feedback loops here.

56
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:09,683
So this is negative feedback right over there.

57
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:12,002
But to complete the loop, if we are investing more,

58
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,653
we are going to build more factories.

59
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:17,253
or some more capacity to do services or whatever else.

60
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:20,225
That is going to increase employment.

61
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,479
If we have more profit,

62
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,894
Then a company feels better about growing,

63
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,458
It feels more like it have a cushion,

64
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,238
and feels more optimistic about the future,

65
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:28,863
that is going to help employment.

66
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:31,185
And obviously, utilization itself

67
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,507
if we want to run the factory lines longer,

68
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,179
we are going to need more people to run those lines.

69
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:38,244
So that will also increase employment.

70
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:40,659
This is like the general feedback loop

71
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,513
you can add little new twists to this,

72
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:47,811
but this is the general idea of a why modern level of inflation,

73
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:52,037
kind of associate with this virtuous cycle,

74
00:02:52,037 --> 99:59:59,999
You normally see in a good economy.
