1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,000
We've learned over the last
several videos that if we have

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,120
a system undergoing constant
pressure, or it's in an

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,490
environment with constant
pressure, that its change in

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,870
enthalpy is equal to the heat
added to the system.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,570
And I'll write this little
p here, because that's at

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,730
constant pressure.

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,780
So if you have a reaction, let's
say A plus B yields C

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,530
and our change in enthalpy-- so
our enthalpy in this state

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,000
minus the change in the enthalpy
in that state-- so

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,860
let's say our change in enthalpy
is less than 0, we

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,520
know that this is exothermic.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,700
Why is that?

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,880
And once again, I'm assuming
constant pressure.

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,850
How do we know this is
exothermic, that we're

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,050
releasing energy?

17
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,950
Because change in enthalpy,
when we're dealing with a

18
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,360
constant pressure system, is
heat added to the system.

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,830
If the heat added to the system
is negative, we must be

20
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,170
releasing heat.

21
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,710
So we're releasing
heat or energy.

22
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,150
So plus energy.

23
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,880
And we learned in the last
video, I think it was either

24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,860
the last video or a couple of
videos ago, we call this an

25
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,110
exothermic reaction.

26
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,430
   

27
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,430
And then if you have a reaction
that needs energy--

28
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:18,310
so let's say you have A plus B
plus some energy yields C,

29
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,630
then what does that mean?

30
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,860
Well, that means that the
system absorbed energy.

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,560
The amount of energy
you absorb is

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,040
your change in enthalpy.

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,530
So your delta H is going
to be positive.

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,350
Your change in enthalpy
is positive.

35
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,025
You've absorbed energy
into the system.

36
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,270
And we call these endothermic
reactions.

37
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,150
   

38
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,210
You're absorbing heat.

39
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,880
Now, if we wanted to figure
out whether reaction just

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,170
happens by itself-- whether it's
spontaneous-- it seems

41
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,560
like this change in enthalpy
is a good candidate.

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,820
Obviously, if I'm releasing
energy, I didn't need any

43
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,280
energy for this reaction to
happen, so maybe this reaction

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,370
is spontaneous.

45
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,480
And likewise, since I'd have to
somehow add energy into the

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:05,200
system, my gut tells me that
this maybe isn't spontaneous.

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,220
But there's a little part of me
that says, well, you know,

48
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,169
what if the particles are
running around really fast,

49
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,800
and they have a lot of kinetic
energy that can be used to

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,780
kind of ram these particles
together, maybe all of a

51
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,470
sudden this would
be spontaneous.

52
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,680
So maybe enthalpy by itself
wouldn't completely describe

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,930
what's going to happen.

54
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,310
So in order to get a little
intuition, and to maybe build

55
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,430
up our sense of whether
a reaction happens

56
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,910
spontaneously, let's think about
the ingredients that

57
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,640
probably matter.

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,932
We already know that delta
H probably matters.

59
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:40,210
If we release energy-- you know,
delta H less than 0,

60
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,940
that tends to make me think
it might be spontaneous.

61
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:50,420
But what if our delta S, what
if our entropy goes down?

62
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,790
What if things become
more ordered?

63
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,920
We've already learned from the
second law of thermodynamics,

64
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,960
that that doesn't tend
to be the case.

65
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,870
And just from personal
experience, we know that

66
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,950
things on their own just don't
kind of go to the macro state

67
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,720
that has fewer micro
states, you know.

68
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,710
An egg doesn't just put itself
together, and bounce, and kind

69
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,080
of jump off the floor on its
own, although there's some

70
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,330
probability it would happen.

71
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,760
So it seems like entropy
matters somewhat.

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,720
And then there's the idea
of temperature.

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,710
Because I already talked about,
when I talked about

74
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,360
energy here.

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
I was like, well, you know, even
if this requires energy,

76
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,410
maybe if the temperature is
high enough, maybe I could

77
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,410
actually ram these particles
together in some way, and kind

78
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,110
of create energy to go here.

79
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,770
So let's think about--
so let's see.

80
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,320
let's think about the
ingredients, and let's think

81
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,240
about what the reactions would
look like depending on

82
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,580
different combinations
of the ingredients.

83
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,390
So the ingredients I'm going to
deal with-- delta H seems

84
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,040
to definitely matter,
whether or not we

85
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,780
absorb energy or not.

86
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,640
We have delta S, our
change in entropy.

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,230
Does the system take on more
states or fewer states?

88
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,100
Does it become more
or less ordered?

89
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,520
And then there's temperature,
which is

90
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,880
average kinetic energy.

91
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,890
So let's just think about a
whole bunch of situations.

92
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,620
So let's think of
the first case.

93
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,810
Let's think of the situation
where our delta H is less than

94
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:21,200
0, and our entropy is
greater than 0.

95
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,630
I mean, my gut already
tells me that

96
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,490
this is going to happen.

97
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,400
This is a situation where
we're going to be more

98
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,380
entropic after the reaction.

99
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,860
So one way of looking
at entropy,

100
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,550
you could more states.

101
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,720
Maybe we have more particles.

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,590
We've seen that entropy is
related to the number of

103
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,770
particles we have. So this
could be a reaction where

104
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,440
let's say we have this--
see, we want

105
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,250
to have more particles.

106
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,280
So let's say I have that guy.

107
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,060
And say he's got one guy like
that there, and then I have

108
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,460
another guy like this, and
let's say he's got a

109
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,260
molecule like this.

110
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,390
Let's say that a more-- well,
I won't say stable or not.

111
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:11,240
But let's say that when these
guys bump into each other, you

112
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,730
end up with this.

113
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,110
And I'm making things
up on the fly.

114
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,700
Maybe one of these molecules
bonds with this molecule, so

115
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,160
you have one of the
dark blues.

116
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,180
I'll draw all the dark blues.

117
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,680
Bonds with this light blue
molecule, one of the dark

118
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,880
blues bonds with the
magenta molecule.

119
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,940
And maybe that brown
molecule just gets

120
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,570
knocked off all by himself.

121
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,760
So we went from having
two molecules to

122
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,920
having three molecules.

123
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,170
We have more disorder,
more entropy.

124
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,990
This can obviously take
on more states.

125
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,260
And I'm telling you that
delta H is less than 0.

126
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,000
So by doing this, these guys,
their electrons are in a lower

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,920
potential, or they're in a more
stable configuration.

128
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,090
So when the electrons go from
their higher potential

129
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,430
configurations over here, and
they become more stable, they

130
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,940
release energy.

131
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,350
So you have plus-- and then I
just know that, because I said

132
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,590
from the beginning that
my change in enthalpy

133
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,470
is less than 0.

134
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,110
So plus some energy.

135
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,610
   

136
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,515
So it seems pretty obvious to me
that this reaction is going

137
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:19,560
to be spontaneous in this
rightward direction.

138
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,050
Because there's no reason why--
first of all, it's much

139
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,120
easier for two particles to
bump into each other just

140
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,330
right to go in that direction
than it is for three

141
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,520
particles-- if you just think of
it from a probability point

142
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,940
of view-- for three particles to
get together just right and

143
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,160
go in that direction.

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,090
And even more, these guys
are more stable.

145
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,420
Their electrons are in a
lower potential state.

146
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,060
So there's no even kind of
enthalpic reason for them to

147
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,840
move in this direction, or you
know, kind of a energy reason

148
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,030
for them to move in
this direction.

149
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,540
So this, to me, I kind of have
the intuition that regardless

150
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,550
of what the temperature is,
we're going to favor this

151
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,680
forward reaction.

152
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,440
So I would say that this is
probably spontaneous.

153
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,740
   

154
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,200
Now, what happens-- let's do
something that's maybe a

155
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,050
little less intuitive.

156
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,090
What happens if my delta
H is less than 0?

157
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,850
But let's say I lose entropy.

158
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,400
And this seems, you know, with
second law of thermodynamics,

159
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,240
if the entropy of the
universe goes up.

160
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,470
I'm just talking about
my system.

161
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,730
But let's say I lose entropy.

162
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,250
So that would be a situation
where I go from, let's say,

163
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,860
two particles.

164
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,490
Let's say I got that particle,
and then I have this particle.

165
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,040
And then, if they bump into each
other just right, their

166
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,230
electrons are going to be more
stable, and maybe they form

167
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,480
this character.

168
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,790
   

169
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,420
And when they do that, the
electrons can enter into lower

170
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,350
potential states, and when they
do, the electrons release

171
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,020
energy, so you have some
plus energy here.

172
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,390
And we know that, because this
was the change in enthalpy was

173
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,230
less than zero.

174
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,460
We have lower energy in this
state than that one, and the

175
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,570
difference is released
right here.

176
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,390
Now will this reaction happen?

177
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,060
Well, it seems like-- let's
introduce our temperature.

178
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,160
What's going to happen
at low temperatures?

179
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,020
At low temperatures, these guys
have a very low average

180
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,770
kinetic energy.

181
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,510
They're just drifting
around very slowly.

182
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,740
And as they drift around
very slowly--

183
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,670
And remember, when I talk about

184
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,200
spontaneity-- I wrote sponteous.

185
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,460
This is spontaneous.

186
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,395
   

187
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,570
Sponteous should be another
thermodynamic.

188
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,820
It's a fun word.

189
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:46,670
   

190
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,440
When I talk about spontaneity,
I'm just talking about whether

191
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,320
the reaction is just going
to happen on its own.

192
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,180
I'm not talking about
how fast, or

193
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,370
the rate of the reaction.

194
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,550
That's a key thing to know.

195
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,240
You know, is this
going to happen.

196
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,720
I don't care if it takes, you
know, a million years for the

197
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,203
thing to happen.

198
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:02,890
I just want to know, is it going
to happen on its own?

199
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,920
So if the temperature is slow,
these guys might be really

200
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,670
creeping along, barely bumping
into each other.

201
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,790
But they will eventually
bump into each other.

202
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,640
And when they do, they're just
drifting past each other.

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,310
And when they drift past each
other, they will configure

204
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,510
themselves in a way-- things
want to go to a lower

205
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,270
potential state.

206
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,880
I'm just trying to give you kind
of a hand-wavey, rough

207
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,090
intuition of things.

208
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,590
But because this will release
energy, and it will go to a

209
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,690
lower potential state, the
electrons kind of configure

210
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,820
themselves when they get near
each other, and enter into

211
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,510
this state.

212
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,990
And they release energy.

213
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,510
And once the energy is gone, and
maybe it's in the form of

214
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,290
heat or whatever it is, it's
hard to kind of get it back

215
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,350
and go on in other direction.

216
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,620
So it seems like this would
be spontaneous if the

217
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,450
temperature is low.

218
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,210
So let me write that.

219
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:57,250
Spontaneous if the
temperate is low.

220
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,750
Now what happens if the
temperature is high?

221
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,340
Remember, these aren't the
only particles here.

222
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,000
We have more.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,090
You know, I'll have another
guy like that, and

224
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,430
another guy like that.

225
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,020
And then this, on this
side, I'll have,

226
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,330
you know, more particles.

227
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,040
There's obviously not
just one particle.

228
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,500
Then all of these macro
variables really make no

229
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,360
sense, if we're just talking
about particular molecules.

230
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,450
We're talking about
entire systems.

231
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,440
But what happens here if
the temperature of

232
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,150
our system is high?

233
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,280
So let's think of a situation
where the temperature is high.

234
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,520
Now all of a sudden-- so on the
side, people are going to

235
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,550
be knocking into each other
super fast. You know, if this

236
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,610
guy bumps into this guy super
fast, you can almost view it

237
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,540
as a car collision.

238
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,580
Well, even better, this could
be car collision.

239
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,310
If these were each individual
cars, and the atoms were the

240
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,870
components of the cars, if
they're like smashing into

241
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,750
each other, even though they
want to be attached to each

242
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,220
other, they have screws and
whatever else that are holding

243
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,440
it together-- if two cars run
into each other fast enough,

244
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,130
all that screws and the glue and
the welding won't matter.

245
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,720
They're just going
to blow apart.

246
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,350
So high kinetic energy--
let me draw that.

247
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,910
So if they have high kinetic
energy, my gut tells me that

248
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,920
on the side of the reaction,
these guys are just going to

249
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,830
blow each other apart
to this side.

250
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,800
And these guys, since these guys
also have high kinetic

251
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,340
energy, they're going to be
moving so fast past each

252
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,640
other, and they're going to
ricochet off of each other so

253
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,870
fast, that the counteracting
force, or the contracting

254
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,380
inclination for their electrons
to get more stably

255
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,170
configured, won't matter.

256
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,720
It's like, imagine trying to
attach a tire to something

257
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,860
while you're running
past the car.

258
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,380
You kind of have to do it-- even
though that's a more--

259
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,320
well, maybe the analogy
is getting weak, here.

260
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,290
But I think you get the idea
that if the temperature's

261
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,590
really high, it seems less
likely that these guys are

262
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,730
going to kind of drift near each
other just right to be

263
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,740
able to attach to each other,
and their electrons to get

264
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,020
more stable, and to do this
whole exothermic thing.

265
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,230
So my sense is that if the
temperature is high enough-- I

266
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,640
mean, you know, maybe say, oh,
that's not high enough.

267
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,880
But what if it's super
high temperatures?

268
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,750
If it's super high temperatures,
then maybe even

269
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,860
this guy will bump into that.

270
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,590
Instead of forming that, he'll
knock this other blue guy off,

271
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,840
and then he'll be over here.

272
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,820
I should do the blue
guy in blue.

273
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,010
And maybe he'll knock this
guy into his constituent

274
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,200
particles, if there's enough
kinetic energy.

275
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,330
So here I get the idea that
it's not spontaneous.

276
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,625
And even more, the reverse
reaction, if the temperature

277
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,870
is high enough, is probably
going to be spontaneous.

278
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,950
If the temperature is high
enough, these guys are going

279
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,130
to react, are going to bump
into each other, and the

280
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,380
reaction is going
to go that way.

281
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,890
So temperature is high, you go
that way, temperature is low,

282
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,300
you go that way.

283
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,580
So let's see if we can put
everything together that we've

284
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,560
seen so far and kind of come up
with a gut feeling of what

285
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,890
a formula for spontaneity
would look like.

286
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,170
So we could start
with enthalpy.

287
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,000
So we already know that look, if
this is less than 0, we're

288
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,256
probably dealing with something
that's spontaneous.

289
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:03,840
Now let's say I want a whole
expression, where if the whole

290
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,350
expression is less than 0, it
tells me that it's going to be

291
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,600
spontaneous.

292
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,300
   

293
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:18,760
So we know that positive entropy
is something good for

294
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,510
spontaneity.

295
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,770
We saw that in every
situation here.

296
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,790
That if we have more states,
it's always a good thing.

297
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,100
It's more likely to make
something spontaneous.

298
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,670
Now, we want our whole
expression to be negative if

299
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,670
it's spontaneous, right?

300
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,420
So positive entropy should make
my whole expression more

301
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,350
negative, so maybe we should
subtract entropy.

302
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,590
   

303
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,800
Right?

304
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,170
If this is positive, then
my whole expression

305
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,550
will be more negative.

306
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,590
Which tells me, hey, this
is spontaneous.

307
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,240
So if this is negative, we're
releasing energy.

308
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,860
And then if this is positive,
we're getting more disordered,

309
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,650
so this whole thing
will be negative.

310
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,360
So that seems good.

311
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,530
Now what if entropy
is negative?

312
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,340
If entropy is negative, this
also kind of speaks to the

313
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,720
idea that if entropy is
negative, it kind of makes the

314
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,360
reaction a little less
spontaneous.

315
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,610
Right?

316
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,100
In this situation, entropy
was negative.

317
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,130
We went from more
disorder to less

318
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,560
disorder, or fewer particles.

319
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,530
And what did we say?

320
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:29,070
When temperature is high,
entropy matters a lot.

321
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,680
When temperature is high, this
less entropic state, they ram

322
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,940
into each other, and they'll
become more entropic.

323
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,560
When temperature is low, maybe
they'll drift close to each

324
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,030
other, and then the enthalpy
part of the equation will

325
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,300
matter more.

326
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,550
So let's see if we
can weight that.

327
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,110
So when temperature is high,
entropy matters.

328
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,630
When temperature is low,
entropy doesn't matter.

329
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,880
So what if we just scaled
entropy by temperature?

330
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,000
What if I just took a
temperature variable here?

331
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,850
Now, my claim, or my intuition,
based on everything

332
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,800
we've experimented so far, is
that if this expression is

333
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,260
less than 0, we should
be dealing with

334
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,510
a spontaneous reaction.

335
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,650
   

336
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,680
And let's see if it gels with
everything we say here.

337
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,050
If the temperature is high--
so this reaction right here

338
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,630
was exothermic, in the
rightwards direction.

339
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,750
When we go to the right, from
more of these molecules to

340
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,490
these fewer ones, I told
you it's exothermic.

341
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,900
Now, at low temperatures, my gut
told me, hey, this should

342
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,510
be spontaneous.

343
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,230
These guys are going to drift
close to each other, and get

344
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,520
into this more stable
configuration.

345
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,370
And that makes sense.

346
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,380
At low temperatures, this term
isn't going to matter much.

347
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,300
You can imagine the extreme.

348
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,370
At absolute 0, this term
is going to disappear.

349
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,190
You can't quite reach
there, but it would

350
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,390
become less and less.

351
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,330
And this term dominates.

352
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,020
Now, at high temperatures, all
of a sudden, this term is

353
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,040
going to dominate.

354
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,890
And if our delta S is less than
0, then this whole term

355
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,190
is going to dominate and
become positive.

356
00:15:59,190 --> 00:15:59,500
Right?

357
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,320
And even if this is negative,
we're subtracting.

358
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,510
So our delta S is negative.

359
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,590
We put a negative here.

360
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,540
So this is going to
be a positive.

361
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,530
So this positive, if the
temperature is high enough--

362
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,260
and remember, we're dealing with
Kelvin, so temperature

363
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,610
can only be positive.

364
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,500
If this is positive enough,
it will overwhelm

365
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,810
any negative enthalpy.

366
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,790
And so it won't be spontaneous
anymore.

367
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,720
And so if the temperature is
high enough, this direction

368
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,940
won't be spontaneous.

369
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,980
And this equation
tells us this.

370
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:32,960
And then if we go to the
negative enthalpy, positive

371
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,380
entropy, so we're releasing
energy, so this is negative,

372
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,550
and our entropy is increasing--
our entropy,

373
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,350
we're getting more disordered--
then this becomes

374
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,500
a negative as well.

375
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,330
So our thing is definitely
going to be negative.

376
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,300
And we already had the sense
that look, if this is negative

377
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,950
and this is positive, we're
getting more entropic and

378
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,060
we're releasing energy, that
should definitely be

379
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,610
spontaneous.

380
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,840
And this equation also
speaks to that.

381
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,890
So so far, I feel pretty good
about this equation.

382
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,520
And as you can imagine,
I didn't think of

383
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,730
this out of the blue.

384
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,850
This actually is the equation
that predicts spontaneity.

385
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,030
And I'm going to show it to
you in a slightly more

386
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,709
rigorous way in the future,
maybe going back to some of

387
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,710
our fundamental formulas for
entropy and things like that.

388
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,040
But this is the formula for
whether something is

389
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,589
spontaneous.

390
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,940
And what I wanted to do in this
video is just give you an

391
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,440
intuition why this formula
kind of makes sense.

392
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,630
And this quantity right here
is called the delta G, or

393
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,180
change in Gibbs free energy.

394
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,850
And this is what does predict
whether a reaction is

395
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,390
spontaneous.

396
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,250
So in the next video, I'll
actually apply this formula a

397
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,090
couple of times.

398
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,800
And then a few videos after
that, we'll do a little bit

399
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,640
more of how you can actually
get this from some of our

400
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,120
basic thermodynamic
principles.
