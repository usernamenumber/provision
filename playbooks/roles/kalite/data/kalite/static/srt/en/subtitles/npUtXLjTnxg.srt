1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,940
We're told that the radius of a
sphere can be measured using

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,760
the formula r is equal to the
cube root of 3 times v,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,970
divided by 4pi, where v is
equal to the volume.

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:13,660
That's interesting.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,760
Normally you have it expressed
the other way, volume as a

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,230
function of radius.

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,120
Here they have radius as
a function of volume.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,680
If the radius of a sphere is 6
inches-- so they're giving us

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,730
the radius; they're saying
it's 6 inches.

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,010
So they're giving us that right

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,460
there-- what is its volume?

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,180
So we have 6 inches--
everything's in inches-- is

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,820
equal to the cube root of 3
times the volume-- that's what

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,000
we need to solve for--
divided by 4pi.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,240
A good first step to get rid of
this cube root, is take the

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,620
cube of both sides or raise both
sides of this equation to

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,820
the third power.

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,630
Let's see, it's 6 inches, you
raise it to the third power.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,850
You have the cube root
of 3v over 4pi.

21
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,810
Raise it to the third power.

22
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,830
And so the left-hand side of
this equation becomes what?

23
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,200
6 times 6 is 36.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,610
36 times 6 is 180,
plus 36 is 216.

25
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,620
So you have 216.

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,603
And you had 6 inches here-- now
that you're cubing it, it

27
00:01:14,603 --> 00:01:17,770
would actually now become 216
cubic inches, or inches

28
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:24,630
cubed-- is equal to-- if you
take the 3v divided by 4pi,

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,480
the cube root is essentially
taking it to the 1/3 power.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,720
Then take that to
the third power.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,260
They unwind each other.

32
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,600
So this just becomes
3v over 4pi.

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,670
Now, to solve for volume, we can
just multiply both sides

34
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,500
of this equation times the
inverse of its coefficient,

35
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,660
times 4pi over 3.

36
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,840
Times-- let me scroll to the
leftt-- times 4pi over 3.

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,160
Let me make sure you can
see what I'm writing.

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,240
And the whole reason why I'm
multiplying by 4pi over 3 is

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,960
so that it cancels out
with the 3 over 4pi.

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,700
And you have your 4pi cancels
out with a 4pi, and then you

41
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,330
have your 3 canceling
out with a 3.

42
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,160
And then you have, your volume
is going to be equal to 4pi

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,630
times 216 over 3.

44
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,050
We could write it this way.

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:24,070
216 times 4pi over 3.

46
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,350
And we could simplify this.

47
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,360
216, the digits add up to--
2 plus 1, plus 6 is 9.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,610
So it will be divisible by 3.

49
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,880
That's a fast way to test
whether something's

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,350
divisible by 3.

51
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,450
So let's see what it is.

52
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,240
3 goes into 216.

53
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,110
3 goes into 21 seven times.

54
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,290
7 times 3 is 21.

55
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,370
Bring down the 6.

56
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,890
You have no remainder,
so bring down the 6.

57
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,260
3 goes into 6 two times.

58
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,070
2 times 3 is 6.

59
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,300
No remainder, so it's 72.

60
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,950
So 216 divided by 3 is 72.

61
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,210
So it's 72 times 4pi is
equal to the volume.

62
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,120
It's going to be cubic inches.

63
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,690
So 4 times 72.

64
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,140
4 times 70 is 280.

65
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,430
And then you have 4 times
2, which is 8.

66
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,170
So it'll be 288pi
cubic inches.

67
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,870
That's our volume.

68
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,460
And we're done.

69
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:18,933
