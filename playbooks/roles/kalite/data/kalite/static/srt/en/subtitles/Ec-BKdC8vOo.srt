1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,060
Let A=(0,0) and B=(b,2) be points on the coordinate plane.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,930
Let ABCDEF be a convex Equilateral hexagon.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,430
So convex means it's not concave,a concave hexagon would look like this

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,220
so that's two sides, three, four, five, six,

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,580
this would be a concave hexagon,

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,740
this is going to be popped out

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,130
and all the sides are going to be equal,

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,750
so it's equilateral hexagon.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,660
They're not telling us it's a regular hexagon,

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,740
so we don't know that all of the angles are going to be the same

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,490
but all the sides will be the same.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,550
then they show us a bunch of sides that are parallel to each other

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,310
and that the y-coordinates of its vertices are

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,270
distinct elements of the set 0,2,4,6,8,10.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,330
The area of the hexagon can be written in the form m square root of n

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,770
where m and n are positive integers

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,780
and n is not divisible by the square of any prime.

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,460
That's just a fancy way of saying that

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,720
we've simplified this radical as much as possible.

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,680
Find m plus n.

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,800
So really the first part let's just make sure

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,290
we can visualize this hexagon.

23
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,410
So let me draw, we know one point one vertex for sure zero zero,

24
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:13,520
so let me draw my x-axis, that is my x-axis right over there

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,650
and then my y axis, my y axis will look like that.

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,960
y axis, we know that the vertex A sits at the point (0,0),

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,820
that is the vertex A.

28
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,610
Now we know that all the vertices have y-coordinates that

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,290
are either zero two four six eight ten,

30
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,790
and they're distinct members of the set

31
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,000
which means no two of the vertices share the same y-coordinates.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,270
They are not going to be on the same horizontal line.

33
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,600
So let me draw these words on lines.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,560
With the x-axis is a zero

35
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,230
then you have Y is equal to two,

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,190
then you have four, and you have six, and then you have eight,

37
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,720
and then you have ten up here.

38
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,790
Now B we already know. So first we've already used up the zero for A,

39
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,830
A is already using up the zero.

40
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,990
B uses up the two they tell us, that the y-coordinate of B is two.

41
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,430
The y-coordinate of B is two, so we use that as well

42
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,830
let me see if I can draw a B over here.

43
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,580
Let me see if I can draw a B sits on the horizontal some place,

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,910
and we - the hexagon has side length s

45
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,240
we don't know what that length is but they're all the same,

46
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,030
so let's call this s, it can help me think about it,

47
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,900
now that I know that this is equilateral hexagon,

48
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,360
all the sides are going to be the same length,

49
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,210
and so we're going to go out here,

50
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,190
we're going to go out here the (b,2),

51
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,180
we don't know what b is but that is our vertex B.

52
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,520
Now F is the other vertex that is connected to A.

53
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,160
F cannot sit on this horizontal, cannot sit on y is equal to two,

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,220
it can't sit on y is equal to six

55
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,680
because this distance would be super far,

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,990
clearly much further than this distance over here

57
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,900
where actually you could have that,

58
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,680
but then you wouldn't be able to draw a really a convex hexagon.

59
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,170
so y,the next vertex is just going to have to sit on this horizontal,

60
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,050
so it's going to be s away,

61
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,540
so it's going to be s away, maybe it will be something like that,

62
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,410
something like that, so let me draw it,

63
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,620
so that is the next vertex, that is vertex F Right?

64
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,730
Because we're going ABCDEF and then back to A.

65
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,660
Fair enough, now what about vertex C.

66
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,060
well vertex C can't be on the four horizontal

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,400
so it gonna have to be on the six horizontal.

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,360
So vertex C is going to have to be some place like that,

69
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,110
Some place like that, that's vertex C.

70
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,550
Once again that length is s, this length is s,

71
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,760
now what about vertex E?

72
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,800
can't be on the six horizontal now already taken up by vertex C

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,080
so the four and the six are already taken up,

74
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,690
so has to be at the at the eight horizontal.

75
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,490
And so this is length s.

76
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,240
And we also know that we're going back to the origin now.

77
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,210
so this is vertex E right here,

78
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,040
we know that we're going back to the origin,

79
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,480
not to the origin we are going back to the same x value,

80
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,400
this is going to be on the y intercept

81
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,050
and the reason why we know that is this is length s,

82
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,040
and this is length s and they both have to,

83
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,900
both of these diagonals travel the same,

84
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,660
they travel the same vertical distance, this base is four,

85
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,940
this base is four,so you can kind of view this is two right triangles,

86
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,110
both of them have base four and hypotenuse s,

87
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,220
and so they share this side right over here

88
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,010
so they both - this one goes out to the left that distance

89
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,400
and this one is going to come back that distance.

90
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,870
Now by the same logic over here,

91
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,890
this guy's going to have to come back

92
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,180
so he's - we can now use the ten coordinate,

93
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,490
the ten y horizontal or the y coordinate of ten

94
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,900
that's the only one we haven't used yet for D,

95
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,340
and since we came out,

96
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,470
when we had a diagonal of length s,

97
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,250
traveling four up,

98
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,770
this time same logic, we had a diagonal length s,

99
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,490
it traveled up four over here and moved out this distance

100
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,440
then we go back at the other direction and traveling up four,

101
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,070
and you're gonna go back in the same direction

102
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,870
so this is going to be directly on top of B.

103
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,680
so the coordinate for D is actually going to be b comma ten,

104
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,420
the y coordinate here is ten.

105
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,970
And there we have our hexagon,

106
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,080
we're done drawing our actual hexagon.

107
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,780
and all this parallel line information they told us is that

108
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,750
AB is parallel to DE,

109
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,280
so AB is parallel to DE and this is kind of obvious here.

110
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,250
BC is parallel to EF,

111
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:42,340
BC is parallel to EF.

112
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,560
and they say CD is parallel to FA, so CD

113
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,460
is parallel to FA and the way we drew it looks pretty clear

114
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,510
that is the case.

115
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,530
Now we define the area,

116
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,820
we defined the area of this hexagon

117
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,430
and it seems like a good starting point,

118
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,340
would be to figure out what s is

119
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,890
and to figure out what s is,

120
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,960
it's really going to be a function of

121
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,360
how much we've inclined this thing. So let's -

122
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,490
let's draw, you can see that this is an equiangular hexagon

123
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,580
that this is kind of skewed, is kind of, we distorted a little bit

124
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,770
but all the sides are of the same length.

125
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,510
So let's just call this theta,

126
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,220
let's call that angle right over there theta,

127
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,570
and they tell us that the angle FAB is 120 degrees,

128
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,260
FAB is a hundred and twenty degrees

129
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,410
that is a hundred and twenty degrees.

130
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,960
So this angle over here on the left,

131
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,420
this angle over here on the left is going to be 180 minus one twenty,

132
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,400
minus theta. So 180 minus one twenty is sixty

133
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
So this single over here sixty minus theta.

134
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,440
The reason I did that is because we have some information,

135
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,250
we know that we traveled up four over here,

136
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,000
and we know that we traveled up two over here

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,260
and maybe we could use that information to solve for s

138
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,290
because s is the hypotenuse of both of these right triangles

139
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,430
that I just constructed. Let me draw them.

140
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,500
So this right triangle right over here I could draw like this,

141
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,020
I could draw like this. So I have s,

142
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,840
I have theta and I have 2,that's this right triangle right over here.

143
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,000
This right triangle looks like this,

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,490
it looks like this, this is,

145
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,050
this angle is sixty minus theta,

146
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,730
and this height over here is four

147
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,830
So let's see what we can do to solve for s.

148
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,380
This triangle on the left or is on the right over here,

149
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,470
this triangle says that

150
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,780
If we take the sine of theta,

151
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,000
the sine of theta is equal to the opposite over the hypotenuse,

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
is equal to two over s, this triangle tells us that the sine,

153
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,910
remember this hypotenuse over here is also s,

154
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,310
the sine of sixty minus theta,

155
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:49,150
the sine of sixty minus theta is equal to four over s.

156
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,550
And if you want set these equal to each other

157
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,080
we could multiply this guy two on both sides.

158
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,840
You can see two sine of theta is equal to four over s,

159
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,560
Sine of sixty minus theta is also equal to four over s,

160
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,310
we can set them equal to each other.

161
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,090
So we have two sine of theta, two,

162
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,070
we have two sine two sine of theta is

163
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:16,360
equal to sine of sixty minus theta.

164
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,190
and then we could use some of our trig identities

165
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,790
we know the sine of a minus b is the same thing,

166
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,460
the sine of a minus b this is equal to

167
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,660
the sine of a times the cosine of b,

168
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,190
or I should say theta in this case,

169
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,120
So sine of sixty cos theta, minus,

170
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,760
this is just a standard trig identity

171
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,220
So it's a difference, sum and difference identity,

172
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,000
minus cosine of sixty,

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,790
minus cosine of sixty times the sine of theta,

174
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,610
times the sine of theta and all this is equal to two sine of theta.

175
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,920
two sine of theta. well sine of sixty degrees

176
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,450
this is the square root of three over two,

177
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,950
square root of three over two.

178
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,150
Cosine of sixty degrees is one-half, is one-half.

179
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,680
So we could add one half sine theta to both sides of this

180
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,600
and what are we going to get.

181
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,820
So we are going to add one-half sine theta,

182
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,580
then this guy's going to go away

183
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,250
and then you add one-half sine of theta to two sine of theta

184
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,890
which is really four half sine of theta,

185
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,550
so that's going to be five halves sine of theta,

186
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,400
so let me add one-half sine of theta, that's five -

187
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,880
five halves sine of theta

188
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,310
is equal to square root of three over two cosine of theta,

189
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:38,170
square root of three over two cosine of theta.

190
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,920
right? I added one half sine of theta to both sides of this

191
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,110
to get this I can multiply both sides by two just to simplify it.

192
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,170
So I get five sine of theta

193
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,410
five sine of theta is equal to the square root of three cosine of theta

194
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,010
Now I want to use that identity sine squared theta plus

195
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,800
cosine squared theta is equal to one.

196
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,600
So let me just square both sides that

197
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,260
will also help us with this radical

198
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,400
So we'll get twenty five sine squared of theta is

199
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,060
equal to square three cosine squared of theta,

200
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,220
Instead of writing cosine squared of theta,

201
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,920
let's just write that's one minus sine squared of theta. Right?

202
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,880
cosine squared theta is one minus sine squared of theta

203
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,930
Just squared both sides.

204
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,950
So let me just write what I just did,

205
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:25,540
I just squared both sides and so we get twenty five sine squared theta

206
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,110
is equal to three minus three sine squared theta

207
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,650
and we can add three sine squared theta to both sides

208
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,340
we get twenty eight sine squared theta is equal to three,

209
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:44,160
or that the sine squared theta,home stretch,to three over twenty eight

210
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,760
Or we could even write that sine of theta,

211
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,850
sine of theta is equal to the square root of three over twenty eight.

212
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,930
So it's equal to the square root of three over twenty eight

213
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,990
now we can simplify that twenty eight is four times seven

214
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,150
so we can take it out,

215
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,750
but that's good enough for now that'll,

216
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,740
that may be you know we'll simplify it

217
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,000
later if we have to sometimes it's easier to deal with.

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,640
So let's see, over here we have we have the sine of theta

219
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,860
now we can relate that actually to s over here we know that,

220
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,490
we know that before I messed with this thing,

221
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,100
we know that the sine of theta is equal to two over s,

222
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,790
or that s over two is equal to one over sine of theta,

223
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,440
or that s is equal to two over the sine of theta.

224
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,170
Well we know what sine of theta is,

225
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,400
it is square root of three over twenty eight.

226
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,000
so s is equal to two divided by sine of theta,

227
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,210
that's like multiplying by the inverse of sine of theta,

228
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,810
so that's two times the square root of twenty eight over three,

229
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,990
twenty eight over three so that is we figured out our s,

230
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,640
two times this thing over here.

231
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,890
Now given that we know s let's see how we can figure out the area.

232
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,220
Well what immediately pops out

233
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,480
is that we have this triangle over here,

234
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,080
that has height or I should say maybe it's base

235
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,530
if you view it sideways, its base is eight,

236
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,630
its base is eight,

237
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,070
and this distance right over here we should be able to figure out,

238
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,370
we should be able to figure out using the Pythagorean theorem,

239
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,560
because we know that this distance right over here is four,

240
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,720
We know that this distance is four.

241
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,670
We know that this distance, the hypotenuse is s,

242
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,380
so we could call this the height of it right over here

243
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,880
we could say that h squared,

244
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,560
h squared plus four squared plus sixteen is equal to

245
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,470
the hypotenuse squared, equal to s squared.

246
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,070
S squared - s is this thing over here so if we want to square s,

247
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,330
it becomes four times twenty-eight,

248
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,650
four times twenty eight over three,

249
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,940
and we'd subtract sixteen from both sides so h is equal to

250
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,140
four times twenty-eight over three minus

251
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,560
if I want to write sixteen over three

252
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,200
or if I want to write sixteen something over three

253
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,820
it's going to be minus forty eight,

254
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,140
minus forty eight over three

255
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,670
let's see I don't wanna multiply,

256
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,260
I don't want to have to multiply four times twenty-eight,

257
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,920
so you can write forty-eight as four times twelve,

258
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,520
so this numerator is going to be

259
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,070
four times twenty-eight minus twelve over -

260
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,180
remember that's h squared I should say,

261
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,940
H squared is going to be

262
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,670
four times twenty-eight minus twelve over three

263
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,980
which is equal to four times sixteen over three,

264
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,620
which is equal to sixty-four over three, that's h squared

265
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,450
so h is going to be the square root of that which is eight

266
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,650
over the square root of three,

267
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,700
so h right over here is eight over the square root of three

268
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,850
so if I want to find the area of this whole thing over here.

269
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,250
well first let's find the area of the small thing right over here

270
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,160
that's just going to be h times four,

271
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,060
so it's going to be,

272
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,720
well,I could do it either way,

273
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,900
but let's just say this is h times four, times one-half,

274
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,600
so it's going to be two times so the area of this triangle,

275
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,240
Let me do it in blue right here,this triangle's area is going to be h,

276
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,430
which is eight, over the square root of three, times four,

277
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,190
times four times one-half,

278
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,120
so this guy right over here is this going to be

279
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,140
two times eight over the square root of three,

280
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,650
or that's going to be sixteen over the square root of three

281
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:33,690
so this guy over here is sixteen over the square root of three.

282
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,510
So that is sixteen over the square root of three.

283
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,380
Now we have a bunch that, we have

284
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,520
this guy and this guy is going to have

285
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,670
the exact same area right over there,

286
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,140
and then you have this guy

287
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,700
who's going to have the exact same area again,

288
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,210
same exact logic, same exact logic, same base, same height,

289
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,780
they're actually congruent,

290
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,310
so you have four of these triangles,

291
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,500
so you are gonna multiply by four

292
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,870
if you want the area of this

293
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,540
or this area I've already shaded in, four times this

294
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,260
where it's sixty four over

295
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,320
where it's sixty four over the square root of three.

296
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,720
now the only area we have left to figure out

297
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,040
is the area of this parallelogram,

298
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,790
the area of the parallelogram in the middle.

299
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,260
Now we know the base of the parallelogram,

300
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,010
the base of this parallelogram is eight,

301
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,590
the base of the parallelogram is eight.

302
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,200
We just have to figure out its height.

303
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,100
We just have to figure out its height

304
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,710
and once again we can use the Pythagorean theorem.

305
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,090
So I'll call this, I don't know, we've already used h,

306
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,420
I'll use h again but this is,

307
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,090
you'd have to remember this is a different height over here,

308
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,820
this base over here is of length two,

309
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,730
two and it's hard to read now,

310
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,940
so we can now write,

311
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:48,540
we can now write that h squared plus four plus two squared is equal to

312
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,050
is equal to s squared

313
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,270
now we already figured out what s squared was in the past,

314
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,930
it's four times twenty-eight over three,

315
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,840
four times twenty eight over three.

316
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,910
Let's subtract four from both sides.

317
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,600
Let's subtract four over there so minus twelve over three.

318
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,850
And now let's see twelve is the same thing as four times three,

319
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:15,040
so this is, this is equal to four times twenty-eight,

320
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,410
four times twenty-eight minus three,

321
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,930
so that's four times twenty-five over three,

322
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,240
which is equal to one hundred over three, that's h squared,

323
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,550
so this h is going to be equal to the square root of this,

324
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,780
which is ten over the square root of three.

325
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,210
This is ten over the square root of three,

326
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,280
so this distance right over here is ten over the square root of three.

327
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,070
So we want the area of this parallelogram is going to be

328
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,530
that height times the base of the parallelogram,

329
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,710
so the area of parallelogram is going to be

330
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,680
eight times ten square root of three, or eighty -

331
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,080
eighty square roots of three.

332
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,860
Eighty, oh no, let me be very careful.

333
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,520
Let me be very careful.

334
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,290
This was ten over -

335
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,360
this is ten over the square root of three is this height.

336
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,720
So the whole area this parallelogram is

337
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,540
eight times ten over the square root of three

338
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,130
so it's eighty over the square root of three.

339
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,930
So the entire area now, if we add everything together,

340
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,530
If we add everything together

341
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,070
we have sixty-four square root of three for these four triangles

342
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,550
plus eighty over square root of three, so let's add it together.

343
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,390
So we have eighty over square root of three for the parallelogram

344
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,530
plus the sixty-four over square root of three for the triangle parts,

345
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,200
and this is equal to one hundred forty-four

346
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,090
over the square root of three,

347
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,680
we can rationalize the denominator,

348
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,470
so times the square root of three over the square root of three,

349
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,030
and in the denominator now we're going to get a

350
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,680
three one forty-four over three is going to be,

351
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,600
what, that's forty-eight, right?

352
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,050
three times forty's a hundred twenty,

353
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,340
three times eight's twenty-four

354
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,320
so it's going to be forty-eight square roots of three

355
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,110
for the area of our entire our entire hexagon

356
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,700
and so we have in the form forty eight square roots of three,

357
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,160
so if you want to find m plus n,

358
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,820
it's forty-eight plus three which is fifty-one.

359
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,740
That was a tiring problem I just find my brain started to

360
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,990
fry near the end of that I had trouble keeping track of things,

361
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,330
anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that.
