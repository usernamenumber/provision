1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,520
Let's figure out the electron
configuration for nickel,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,300
right there.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,520
28 electrons.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,360
We just have to figure
out what shells and

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,540
orbitals they go in.

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,580
28 electrons.

8
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,210
So the way we've learned
to do it is, we

9
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,000
defined this as the s-block.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,830
And we can just remember that
helium actually belongs here

11
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,350
when we talk about orbitals
in the s-block.

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,810
This is the d-block.

13
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,300
This is the p-block.

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,210
And so we could start with the
lowest energy electrons.

15
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,145
We could either work forward
or work backwards.

16
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:34,630
If we work forwards, first
we fill up the first two

17
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,020
electrons going to 1s2.

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,690
So remember we're
doing nickel.

19
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,670
So we fill up 1s2 first
with two electrons.

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,785
Then we go to 2s2.

21
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:51,670
And remember this little small
superscript 2 just means we're

22
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,820
putting two electrons
into that subshell

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,140
or into that orbital.

24
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,440
Actually, let me do each shell
in a different color.

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,870
So 2s2.

26
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,440
Then we fill out 2p6.

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,700
We fill out all of these,
right there.

28
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,220
So 2p6.

29
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,310
Let's see, so far we've filled
out 10 electrons.

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,600
We've configured 10.

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,390
You can do it that way.

32
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,590
Now we're on the third shell.

33
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,990
So now we go to 3s2.

34
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,190
Remember, we're dealing with
nickel, so we go to 3s2.

35
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,640
   

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,480
Then we fill out in the third
shell the p orbital.

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,730
So 3p6.

38
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,190
   

39
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,810
We're in the third period, so
that's 3p6, right there.

40
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,660
There's six of them.

41
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,470
And then we go to the
fourth shell.

42
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,450
I'll do it in yellow.

43
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,700
So we do 4s2.

44
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,270
   

45
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,990
And now we're in the d-block.

46
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,540
And so we're filling in one,
two, three, four, five, six,

47
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,670
seven, eight in this d-block.

48
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,160
So it's going to say d8.

49
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,010
And remember, it's not
going to be 4d8.

50
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,650
We're going to go and backfill
the third shell.

51
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,650
So it will be 3d8.

52
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,650
So we could write 3d8 here.

53
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,350
So this is the order in which
we fill, from lowest energy

54
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,420
state electrons to highest
energy state.

55
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,200
But notice the highest energy
state electrons, which are

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,100
these that we filled in, in the
end, these eight, these

57
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,860
went into the third shell.

58
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,200
So when you're filling the
d-block, you take the period

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,580
that you're in minus one.

60
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,890
So we were in the fourth period
in the periodic table,

61
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,550
but we subtracted one, right?

62
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,940
This is 4 minus 1.

63
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,110
So this is the electron
configuration for nickel.

64
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,790
And of course if we remember,
if we care about the valence

65
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:51,170
electrons, which electrons are
in the outermost shell, then

66
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,090
you would look at these
right here.

67
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,280
These are the electrons that
will react, although these are

68
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,430
in a higher energy state.

69
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,550
And these react because they're
the furthest. Or at

70
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,520
least, the way I visualize
them is that they have a

71
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,560
higher probability of being
further from the nucleus than

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,220
these right here.

73
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,060
Now, another way to figure out
the electron configuration for

74
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,490
nickel-- and this is covered
in some chemistry classes,

75
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,250
although I like the way we just
did it because you look

76
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,180
at the periodic table and you
gain a familiarity with it,

77
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,510
which is important, because then
you'll start having an

78
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,250
intuition for how different
elements react with each

79
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,830
other-- is to just say, OK,
nickel has 28 electrons, if

80
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,410
it's neutral.

81
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,710
It has 28 electrons, because
that's the same number of

82
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,750
protons, which is the
atomic number.

83
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,600
Remember, 28 just tells you how
many protons there are.

84
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,150
This is the number of protons.

85
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,610
We're assuming it's neutral.

86
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,230
So it has the same number
of electrons.

87
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,700
That's not always going
to be the case.

88
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,040
But when you do these electron
configurations, that tends to

89
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,050
be the case.

90
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:54,180
So if we say nickel has 28, has
an atomic number of 28, so

91
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,430
it's electron configuration we
can do it this way, too.

92
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,290
We can write the
energy shells.

93
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,570
So one, two, three, four.

94
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,980
And then on the top
we write s, p, d.

95
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,180
Well we're not going
to get to f.

96
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,510
But you could write f and
g and h and keep going.

97
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,080
What's going to happen is you're
going to fill this one

98
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,060
first, then you're going to fill
this one, then that one,

99
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,720
then this one, then this one.

100
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
Let me actually draw it.

101
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,480
So what you do is, these are the
shells that exist, period.

102
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,950
These are the shells that
exist, in green.

103
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,620
What I'm drawing now isn't the
order that you fill them.

104
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,930
This is just, they exist. So
there is a 3d subshell.

105
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,340
There's not a 3f subshell.

106
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,140
There is a 4f subshell.

107
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,090
Let me draw a line here,
just so it becomes

108
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,430
a little bit neater.

109
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,710
And the way you fill them is
you make these diagonals.

110
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,780
So first you fill this s shell
like that, then you fill this

111
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,620
one like that.

112
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,930
Then you do this diagonal
down like that.

113
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,410
Then you do this diagonal
down like that.

114
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,560
And then this diagonal
down like that.

115
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,420
And you just have to know that
there's only two can fit in s,

116
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,340
six in p, in this
case, 10 in d.

117
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,040
And we can worry about f in the
future, but if you look at

118
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,610
the f-block on a periodic
table, you know how many

119
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,740
there are in f.

120
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,820
So you fill it like that.

121
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,300
So first you just say, OK.

122
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,460
For nickel, 28 electrons.

123
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,010
So first I fill this one out.

124
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,260
So that's 1s2.

125
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,620
   

126
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,660
Then I go, there's no 1p,
so then I go to 2s2.

127
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,740
   

128
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,840
Let me do this in a
different color.

129
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,480
So then I go right here, 2s2.

130
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,000
That's that right there.

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,530
Then I go up to this diagonal,
and I come back down.

132
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,720
And then there's 2p6.

133
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,380
And you have to keep track of
how many electrons you're

134
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,320
dealing with, in this case.

135
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,050
So we're up to 10 now.

136
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,710
So we used that one up.

137
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,260
Then the arrow tells us to go
down here, so now we do the

138
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,650
third energy shell.

139
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,660
So 3s2.

140
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,460
And then where do we go next?

141
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,520
3s2.

142
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,550
Then we follow the arrow.

143
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,260
We start there, there's
nothing there, there's

144
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,980
something here.

145
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,020
So we go to 3p6.

146
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,660
And then the next thing
we fill out is 4s2.

147
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,820
So then we go to 4s2.

148
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,390
And then what's the very
next thing we fill out?

149
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,510
We have to go back to the top.

150
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,790
We come here and then
we fill out 3d.

151
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,470
And then how many electrons do
we have left to fill out?

152
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,720
So we're going to be in 3d.

153
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,100
   

154
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,530
And how many have
we used so far?

155
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,820
2 plus 2 is 4.

156
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,650
4 plus 6 is 10.

157
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,760
10 plus two is 12.

158
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,040
18.

159
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,550
20.

160
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,600
We've used 20, so we have 8 more
electrons to configure.

161
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,950
And the 3d subshell can fit the
8 we need, so we have 3d8.

162
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,130
And there you go, you've got the
exact same answer that we

163
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,670
had when we used the
first method.

164
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,770
Now I like the first method
because you're looking at the

165
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,090
periodic table the whole time,
so you kind of understand an

166
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,250
intuition of where all
the elements are.

167
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,260
And you also don't have to keep
remembering, OK, how many

168
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,260
have I used up as I
filled the shells?

169
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,480
Right?

170
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,700
Here you have to say, I used
two, then I used two more.

171
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,770
And you have to draw this kind
of elaborate diagram.

172
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,230
Here you can just use
the periodic table.

173
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,440
And the important thing is
you can work backwards.

174
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,230
Here there's no way of just
eyeballing this and saying,

175
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,920
OK, our most energetic electrons
are going to be 3d8,

176
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,930
and our highest energy shell
is going to be 4s2.

177
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,820
There's no way you could get
that out of this without going

178
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,330
through this fairly
involved process.

179
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,740
But when do you use this method,
you can immediately

180
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:44,620
say, OK, if I'm worried about
element Zr, right here.

181
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,790
If I'm worried about
element Zr.

182
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,000
I could go through the whole
exercise of filling out the

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,430
entire electron configuration.

184
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,800
But usually the highest shell,
or the highest energy

185
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,780
electrons, are the ones
that matter the most.

186
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,580
So you immediately say, OK, I'm
filling in 2d there, but

187
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,360
remember, d, you go
one period below.

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,230
So this is 4d2.

189
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,550
Right?

190
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,640
Because the period is five.

191
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,890
So you say, 4d2.

192
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,920
   

193
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,130
And then, before that,
you filled

194
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,950
out the five s2 electrons.

195
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,010
   

196
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,410
And then you could keep
going backwards.

197
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,660
And you filled out the 4p6.

198
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,780
   

199
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:31,450
And then, before you filled out
the 4p6, then you had 10

200
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,390
in the d here.

201
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,400
But what is that?

202
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,820
It's in the fourth period, but d
you subtract one from it, so

203
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,620
this is 3d10.

204
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,890
So 3d10.

205
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,910
And then you had 4s2.

206
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,140
This is getting messy.

207
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,929
Let me just write that.

208
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,920
So you have 4d2.

209
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,400
That's those two there.

210
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,800
Then you have 5s2.

211
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,920
   

212
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,870
Then we had 4p6.

213
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,130
That's over here.

214
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,830
Then we had 3d10.

215
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,930
Remember, 4 minus 1, so 3d10.

216
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,660
And then you had 4s2.

217
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,640
And you just keep going
backwards like that.

218
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,620
But what's nice about going
backwards is you immediately

219
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,310
know, OK, what electrons are
in my highest energy shell?

220
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,450
Well I have this five as the
highest energy shell I'm at.

221
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,320
And these two that I filled
right there, those are

222
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,850
actually the electrons in the
highest energy shell.

223
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,480
They're not the highest
energy electrons.

224
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,010
These are.

225
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,280
But these are kind of the ones
that have the highest

226
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,030
probability of being furthest
away from the nucleus.

227
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,780
So these are the ones that
are going to react.

228
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,400
And these are the ones
that matter for

229
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,450
most chemistry purposes.

230
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,180
And just a little touchpoint
here, and this isn't covered a

231
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,200
lot, but we like to think that
electrons are filling these

232
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,780
buckets, and they stay
in these buckets.

233
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,100
But once you fill up an atom
with electrons, they're not

234
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,010
just staying in this nice,
well-behaved way.

235
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,980
They're all jumping between
orbitals, and mixing together,

236
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,330
and doing all sorts of crazy,
unpredictable things.

237
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,750
But this method is what allows
us to at least get a sense of

238
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,350
what's happening in
the electron.

239
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,440
For most purposes, they do tend
to react or behave in

240
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,500
ways that these orbitals kind
of stay to themselves.

241
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,220
But anyway, the main point of
here is really just to teach

242
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,230
you how to do electron
configurations, because that's

243
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,710
really useful for
later on knowing

244
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,630
how things will interact.

245
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,125
And what's especially useful is
to know what electrons are

246
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,520
in the outermost shell, or what

247
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,770
are the valence electrons.

248
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,787
