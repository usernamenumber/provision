1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
   

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,110
In the video that I just did,
where I try to more rigorously

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,910
prove the Gibbs free energy
relation, and that if this

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,620
relation is less than zero
then this is spontaneous.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,890
I took great pains to make sure
that we use the proper

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,100
definition of entropy.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,080
That every time that we said,
OK, a change in entropy from

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,870
here to here is the heat
absorbed by a reversible

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,050
process divided by the
temperature at

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,290
which it was absorbed.

11
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,630
And the change in entropy of
the environment is the

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,990
opposite of that and, of course,
that is equal to zero.

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,860
And I was very careful to
use this definition.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,920
And so you might have been
asking, hey Sal, there's a

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,690
much simpler definition or
proof in my textbook.

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,720
And I don't if it's in your
textbook, but it's in some of

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,290
the ones that I've seen
and in some of the web

18
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,470
pages I've looked at.

19
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,960
Where they use a much simpler
argument that gets us

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,240
eventually to this Gibbs
free energy relation.

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,800
And I thought I would go over
it because as far as I can

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,080
tell, it's incorrect.

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,940
And what the argument tends to
go, is it says, look, the

24
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,519
second law of thermodynamics
tells us, that for any

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:13,870
spontaneous process, that delta
S is greater than zero.

26
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,900
I agree with that completely
right now.

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,900
And in order for delta S, and
that's delta S of the

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,120
universe, is greater
than zero.

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,760
And that means that delta S of
the system plus dealt S of the

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,390
environment is going to
be greater than zero.

31
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,090
and then this is the step that
you'll often see in a lot of

32
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,020
textbooks and a lot of websites
that I disagree with.

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:44,670
They'll say delta S of the
environment is equal to the

34
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:53,100
heat or, let me say, the heat
absorbed by the environment,

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,860
divided by the temperature
of the environment.

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,540
And let's just say for
simplicity that everything

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,685
here it's in some type of
temperature equilibrium.

38
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:02,390
And it tends to be when we're
dealing with stuff in our

39
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,150
chemistry sets in our
labs, whatever else.

40
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,169
But the the reason why I
disagree with this step right

41
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,810
here, that you see in a lot of
textbooks, is that this is not

42
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,000
saying anything about the
reversibility of the reaction.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,810
You can only use this
thermodynamic definition of

44
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,930
entropy if you know this heat
transfer is reversible.

45
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,850
   

46
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,370
And when we're doing it in
general terms, we don't know

47
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,070
whether it's reversal.

48
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,690
In fact, if we're saying to
begin with that the reaction

49
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,340
is spontaneous, that means
by definition that it's

50
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,810
irreversible.

51
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,370
So this is actually an
irreversible transfer of heat,

52
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,990
which is not the definition
of entropy.

53
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,990
The thermodynamic definition
of entropy is a

54
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,200
very delicate one.

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,030
You have to make sure that it
is a reversible reaction.

56
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,470
Obviously, in a lot of first
year chemistry classes this

57
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,160
doesn't matter.

58
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,620
You're going to get the
question right.

59
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,790
In fact, the question might be
dependent upon you making this

60
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,760
incorrect assumption.

61
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,550
So I don't want to confuse
you too much.

62
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,620
But I want to show you that
this is not a right

63
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,050
assumption.

64
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,450
Because if you're assuming
something is spontaneous, and

65
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,105
you're saying, OK, the change in
entropy in the environment

66
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:13,400
is equal to the amount of heat
the environment absorbs,

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,330
divided by T-- this is wrong
because this is not an

68
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,030
irreversible reaction.

69
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,690
But let's just see how this
argument tends to proceed.

70
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,270
So they'll say, OK, this is
equal to delta S of our system

71
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,440
plus the change in heat of our
environment, divided by the

72
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,260
temperature of our
environment.

73
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,980
They'll call this for the
environment, and that of

74
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,940
course has to be
equal to zero.

75
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,400
And they'll say, look, the
heat absorbed by the

76
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,760
environment is equal to the
minus of the heat absorbed by

77
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,680
the system.

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,170
Right?

79
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,230
It's either the system is
giving energy to the

80
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,160
environment or the environment
is giving energy or heat to

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,650
the system.

82
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,770
So they are just going to be
the minus of each other.

83
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,170
So the argument would go, well
this thing I can rewrite.

84
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,130
This equation is the change in
entropy of the system, instead

85
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,220
of writing a plus Q of the
environment here, I could

86
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,480
write a minus Q of the system
over T is greater than zero.

87
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,279
And then they multiply both
sides of this equation by T

88
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,230
and you get T delta S of the
system minus the heat absorbed

89
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,230
by the system is greater
than zero.

90
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,760
You multiply both sides of this
by negative one and you

91
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,880
get the heat absorbed by the
system minus the temperature

92
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,990
times the change in entropy of
the system is greater than

93
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,120
zero-- I'm sorry, is less than
zero when you multiply both

94
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,090
sides by a negative, you
switch the signs.

95
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,660
And then if you assume constant
pressure, this is the

96
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,250
change in enthalpy
of the system.

97
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,330
So you get the change in
enthalpy minus the temperature

98
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,485
times delta S of the system
is less than zero.

99
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:56,450
And they say, see this shows
that if you have a negative

100
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,230
Gibbs free energy or change in
Gibbs free energy, then you're

101
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,260
spontaneous.

102
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,400
But all of that was predicated
on the idea that this could be

103
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,780
rewritten like this.

104
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,500
But it can't be rewritten like
that, because this is not a

105
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,520
reversible process.

106
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,170
We're starting from the
assumption that this is a

107
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,560
spontaneous irreversible
process.

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,410
And so you can't make this
substitution here.

109
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,700
And that's why in the earlier
video I was very careful not

110
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,090
to make that substitution.

111
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,210
I was very careful to say, oh,
you know, the change in

112
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,450
entropy of an irreversible
system that goes from here to

113
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:39,800
here is the same as the change
in entropy as an irreversible

114
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,920
system that goes from
there to there.

115
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,090
Or let me say this
differently.

116
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,550
The change in entropy of a
reversible system from there

117
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,570
to there is the same as
an irreversible system

118
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,300
from there to there.

119
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,920
Although you don't know what
goes on in between for the

120
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,240
irreversible.

121
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,040
And so that's why I made
this comparison.

122
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,340
This thing, and this thing are
the same, but then we compared

123
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,830
the heat absorbed by an
irreversible system, and we

124
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,910
showed that it's less than the
heat absorbed by a reversible

125
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,090
system because it's generating
its own friction.

126
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,760
And from that, we got this
relation, which we were able

127
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,250
to then go and get the Gibbs
free energy relation.

128
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,730
So, anyway, I don't want to make
a video that's too geeky

129
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,470
or too particular, or
kind of trying to

130
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,330
really pick at the details.

131
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,210
But I think it's an important
point to make because so much

132
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,000
of what we talk about,
especially in thermodynamics,

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,485
is our definition of entropy.

134
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:33,090
And it's very important we use
the correct one, and we don't

135
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,700
take what I would argue are
incorrect shortcuts, because

136
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,320
this is not the definition
of entropy right there.
