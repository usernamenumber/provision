1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,560
I've now done a bunch of videos
on thermodynamics, both

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,070
in the chemistry and the
physics playlist, and I

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,750
realized that I have yet to give
you, or at least if my

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,300
memory serves me correctly, I
have yet to give you the first

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,550
law of thermodynamics.

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,310
And I think now is as
good a time as any.

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,560
The first law of
thermodynamics.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,260
   

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,310
And it's a good one.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,330
It tells us that energy-- I'll
do it in this magenta color--

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:38,790
energy cannot be created or
destroyed, it can only be

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,680
transformed from one
form or another.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:53,020
So energy cannot be created or
destroyed, only transformed.

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,930
   

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,280
So let's think about a couple
of examples of this.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,780
And we've touched on this when
we learned mechanics and

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,960
kinetics in our physics
playlist, and we've done a

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,620
bunch of this in the chemistry
playlist as well.

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,860
So let's say I have some rock
that I just throw as fast as I

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,410
can straight up.

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,800
Maybe it's a ball
of some kind.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,370
So I throw a ball straight up.

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,510
That arrow represents its
velocity vector, right?

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,890
it's going to go
up in the air.

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,570
Let me do it here.

27
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,760
I throw a ball and it's going
to go up in the air.

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,290
It's going to decelerate
due to gravity.

29
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,530
And at some point, up here, the
ball is not going to have

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,230
any velocity.

31
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,060
So at this point it's going to
slow down a little bit, at

32
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,160
this point it's going to slow
down a little bit more.

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,920
And at this point it's going
to be completely stationary

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,040
and then it's going to start
accelerating downwards.

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,690
In fact, it was always
accelerating downwards.

36
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,130
It was decelerating upwards,
and then it'll start

37
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,200
accelerating downwards.

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,220
So here its velocity will
look like that.

39
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,980
And here its velocity
will look like that.

40
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,330
Then right when it gets back
to the ground, if we assume

41
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,250
negligible air resistance, its
velocity will be the same

42
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,360
magnitude as the upward but
in the downward direction.

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,660
So when we looked at this
example, and we've done this

44
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,810
tons in the projectile motion
videos in the physics

45
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,240
playlist, over here we said,
look, we have some kinetic

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,740
energy here.

47
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,550
And that makes sense.

48
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,230
I think, to all of us, energy
intuitively means that you're

49
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,120
doing something.

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,110
So kinetic energy.

51
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,580
Energy of movement,
of kinetics.

52
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,810
It's moving, so it has energy.

53
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,220
But then as we decelerate up
here, we clearly have no

54
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,880
kinetic energy, zero
kinetic energy.

55
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,830
   

56
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,860
So where did our energy go?

57
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,920
I just told you the first law of
thermodynamics, that energy

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,860
cannot be created
or destroyed.

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,520
But I clearly had a lot of
kinetic energy over here, and

60
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,570
we've seen the formula for that
multiple times, and here

61
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,460
I have no kinetic energy.

62
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,470
So I clearly destroyed kinetic
energy, but the first law of

63
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,630
thermodynamics tells me
that I can't do that.

64
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,290
So I must have transformed
that kinetic energy.

65
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,440
I must have transformed
that kinetic energy

66
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,840
into something else.

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,010
And in the case of this ball,
I've transformed it into

68
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,530
potential energy.

69
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,490
So now I have potential
energy.

70
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,970
And I won't go into the math of
it, but potential energy is

71
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:17,190
just the potential to turn into
other forms of energy.

72
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,480
I guess that's the easy
way to do it.

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,660
But the way to think about it
is, look, the ball is really

74
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,870
high up here, and by virtue of
its position in the universe,

75
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,120
if something doesn't stop it,
it's going to fall back down,

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,890
or it's going to be converted
into another form of energy.

77
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,520
Now let me ask you
another question.

78
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,560
Let's say I throw this ball up
and let's say we actually do

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,820
have some air resistance.

80
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,100
So I throw the ball up.

81
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,990
I have a lot of kinetic
energy here.

82
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,450
Then at the peak of where the
ball is, it's all potential

83
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,082
energy, the kinetic energy
has disappeared.

84
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:50,410
And let's say I have
air resistance.

85
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,020
So when the ball comes back
down, the air was kind of

86
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,130
slowing it down, so when it
reaches this bottom point,

87
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,340
it's not going as fast
as I threw it.

88
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,910
So when I reach this bottom
point here, my ball is going a

89
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,450
lot slower than I threw
it up to begin with.

90
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,970
And so if you think about what
happened, I have a lot of

91
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,890
kinetic energy here.

92
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,890
I'll give you the formula.

93
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,440
The kinetic energy is the mass
of the ball, times the

94
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,500
velocity of the ball,
squared, over 2.

95
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,950
That's the kinetic
energy over here.

96
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,899
And then I throw it.

97
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,160
It all turns into potential
energy.

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,590
Then it comes back down, and
turns into kinetic energy.

99
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,850
But because of air resistance,
I have a

100
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,930
smaller velocity here.

101
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,880
I have a smaller velocity
than I did there.

102
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,910
Kinetic energy is only dependent
on the magnitude of

103
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,380
the velocity.

104
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,570
I could put a little absolute
sign there to show that we're

105
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,570
dealing with the magnitude
of the velocity.

106
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,810
So I clearly have a lower
kinetic energy here.

107
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:50,340
So lower kinetic energy here
than I did here, right?

108
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,370
And I don't have any potential
energy left.

109
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,650
Let's say this is the ground.

110
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,890
We've hit the ground.

111
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,560
So I have another conundrum.

112
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,380
You know, when I went from
kinetic energy to no kinetic

113
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,365
energy there, I can go
to the first law and

114
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:03,000
say, oh, what happened?

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,560
And the first law says, oh,
Sal, it all turned into

116
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,190
potential energy up here.

117
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,510
And you saw it turned into
potential energy because when

118
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,050
the ball accelerated back down,
it turned back into

119
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,710
kinetic energy.

120
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,340
But then I say, no, Mr. First
Law of Thermodynamics, look,

121
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,390
at this point I have no
potential energy, and I had

122
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,830
all kinetic energy and I had
a lot of kinetic energy.

123
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,660
Now at this point, I have no
potential energy once again,

124
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,930
but I have less kinetic
energy.

125
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,300
My ball has fallen at
a slower rate than I

126
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,760
threw it to begin with.

127
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,560
And the thermodynamics
says, oh, well that's

128
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,270
because you have air.

129
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,200
And I'd say, well I do
have air, but where

130
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,410
did the energy go?

131
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,990
And then the first law of
thermodynamics says, oh, when

132
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,970
your ball was falling-- let
me see, that's the ball.

133
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,790
Let me make the ball yellow.

134
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,980
So when your ball was falling,
it was rubbing

135
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,990
up against air particles.

136
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,990
It was rubbing up against
molecules of air.

137
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,920
   

138
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,480
And right where the molecules
bumped into the wall, there's

139
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,100
a little bit of friction.

140
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,310
Friction is just essentially,
your ball made these molecules

141
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,120
that it was bumping into vibrate
a little bit faster.

142
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,710
And essentially, if you think
about it, if you go back to

143
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,860
the macrostate/ microstate
problem or descriptions that

144
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,870
we talked about, this ball is
essentially transferring its

145
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,630
kinetic energy to the molecules
of air that it rubs

146
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,360
up against as it falls
back down.

147
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,910
And actually it was doing it
on the way up as well.

148
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,100
And so that kinetic energy that
you think you lost or you

149
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,360
destroyed at the bottom, of
here, because your ball's

150
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,920
going a lot slower, was actually
transferred to a lot

151
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,240
of air particles.

152
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,200
It was a lot of-- to a bunch
of air particles.

153
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,100
Now, it's next to impossible to
measure exactly the kinetic

154
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,480
energy that was done on each
individual air particle,

155
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,820
because we don't even know what
their microstates were to

156
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,810
begin with.

157
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,910
But what we can say is, in
general I transferred some

158
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,070
heat to these particles.

159
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,400
I raised the temperature of
the air particles that the

160
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,410
ball fell through by rubbing
those particles or giving them

161
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,000
kinetic energy.

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,395
Remember, temperature is just
a measure of kinetic-- and

163
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:14,530
temperature is a macrostate or
kind of a gross way or a macro

164
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,630
way, of looking at the
kinetic energy of

165
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,960
the individual molecules.

166
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,090
It's very hard to measure each
of theirs, but if you say on

167
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,890
average their kinetic energy
is x, you're essentially

168
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,730
giving an indication
of temperature.

169
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,770
So that's where it went.

170
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,210
It went to heat.

171
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,130
And heat is another
form of energy.

172
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,500
So that the first law
of thermodynamics

173
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,300
says, I still hold.

174
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,000
You had a lot of kinetic energy,
turned into potential,

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,860
that turned into less
kinetic energy.

176
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,820
And where did the
remainder go?

177
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,780
It turned into heat.

178
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,720
Because it transferred that
kinetic energy to these air

179
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,570
particles in the surrounding
medium.

180
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,010
Fair enough.

181
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,630
So now that we have that out of
the way, how do we measure

182
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,460
the amount of energy that
something contains?

183
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,150
   

184
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,610
And here we have something
called the internal energy.

185
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,060
The internal energy
of a system.

186
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,620
Once again this is a macrostate,
or you could call

187
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,510
it a macro description
of what's going on.

188
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,556
This is called u for internal.

189
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,250
The way I remember that is that
the word internal does

190
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,020
not begin with a U.

191
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,440
U for internal energy.

192
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:25,940
   

193
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,100
Let me go back to my example--
that I had in the past, that I

194
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,299
did in our previous video, if
you're watching these in

195
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:39,130
order-- of I have, you know,
some gas with some movable

196
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,919
ceiling at the top.

197
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,220
That's its movable ceiling.

198
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,190
That can move up and down.

199
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,860
We have a vacuum up there.

200
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,350
And I have some gas in here.

201
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,040
   

202
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,360
The internal energy literally is
all of the energy that's in

203
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,000
the system.

204
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,210
So it includes, and for our
purposes, especially when

205
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,210
you're in a first-year chemistry
course, it's the

206
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:07,330
kinetic energy of all the
atoms or molecules.

207
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,140
   

208
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,820
And in a future video, I'll
actually calculate it for how

209
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,360
much kinetic energy is
there in a container.

210
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,100
And that'll actually be our
internal energy plus all of

211
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,780
the other energy.

212
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,590
So these atoms, they have some
kinetic energy because they

213
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,610
have some translational motion,
if we look at the

214
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,810
microstates.

215
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,430
If they're just individual
atoms, you can't really say

216
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,780
that they're rotating, because
what does it mean for an atom

217
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,580
to rotate, right?

218
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,050
Because its electrons are just
jumping around anyway.

219
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,670
So if they're individual atoms
they can't rotate, but if

220
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,970
they're molecules they can
rotate, if it looks

221
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,440
something like that.

222
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,520
There could be some rotational
energy there.

223
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,790
It includes that.

224
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,630
If we have bonds-- so I
just drew a molecule.

225
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,180
The molecule has bonds.

226
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,020
Those bonds contain
some energy.

227
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,270
That is also included in
the internal energy.

228
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,130
If I have some electrons, let's
say that this was not

229
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,400
a-- well I'm doing it using a
gas, and gases aren't good

230
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,930
conductors-- but let's say
I'm doing it for a solid.

231
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,390
So I'm using the wrong tools.

232
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:11,310
So let's say I have
some metal.

233
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,250
Those are my metal-- let me do
more-- my metal atoms. And in

234
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,326
that metal atom, I have, a
bunch of electrons-- well

235
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:24,540
that's the same color-- I have
a bunch of-- let me use a

236
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,760
suitably different color--
I have a bunch

237
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,250
of electrons here.

238
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,720
And I have fewer here.

239
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,660
So these electrons really
want to get here.

240
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,740
Maybe they're being stopped for
some reason, so they have

241
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,290
some electrical potential.

242
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,250
Maybe there's a gap here, you
know, where they can't conduct

243
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,970
or something like that.

244
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,610
Internal energy includes
that as well.

245
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,500
That's normally the scope out
of what you'd see in a

246
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,480
first-year chemistry class.

247
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,810
But it includes that.

248
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,920
It also includes literally
every form of energy that

249
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,060
exists here.

250
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,870
It also includes, for example,
in a metal, if we were to heat

251
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,910
this metal up they start
vibrating, right?

252
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,520
They start moving left and
right, or up or down, or in

253
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,690
every possible direction.

254
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,760
And if you think about a
molecule or an atom that's

255
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,420
vibrating, it's going from here,
and then it goes there,

256
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,960
then it goes back there.

257
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,330
It goes back and forth, right?

258
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,750
And if you think about what's
happening, when it's in the

259
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,240
middle point it has a lot of
kinetic energy, but at this

260
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,670
point right here, when it's
about to go back, it's

261
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,550
completely stationary for
a super small moment.

262
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,360
And at that point, all
of its kinetic energy

263
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,590
is potential energy.

264
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,910
And then it turns into
kinetic energy.

265
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,490
Then it goes back to potential
energy again.

266
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,940
It's kind of like a
pendulum, or it's

267
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,010
actually harmonic motion.

268
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,010
So in this case, internal
energy also includes the

269
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,990
kinetic energy for the molecules
that are moving

270
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,110
fast. But it also includes the
potential energies for the

271
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,530
molecules that are vibrating,
they're at that point where

272
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,470
they don't have kinetic
energy.

273
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,450
So it also includes
potential energy.

274
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,000
So internal energy is literally
all of the energy

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,810
that's in a system.

276
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,270
And for most of what we're going
to do, you can assume

277
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,190
that we're dealing with
an ideal gas.

278
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,710
Instead of, it becomes a lot
more complicated with solids,

279
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,580
and conductivity, and vibrations
and all that.

280
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,900
We're going to assume we're
dealing with an ideal gas.

281
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,910
And even better, we're going to
assume we're dealing with a

282
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,850
monoatomic ideal gas.

283
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,850
And maybe this is just
helium, or neon.

284
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,990
One of the ideal gases.

285
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,430
They don't want to bond
with each other.

286
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,250
They don't form molecules
with each other.

287
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,880
   

288
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,010
Let's just assume that
they're not.

289
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:32,030
They're just individual atoms.
And in that case, the internal

290
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,340
energy, we really can simplify
to it being the kinetic

291
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,380
energy, if we ignore all
of these other things.

292
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,690
But it's important to realize,
internal energy is everything.

293
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,430
It's all of the energy
inside of a system.

294
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,880
If you said, what's the
energy of the system?

295
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,280
Its internal energy.

296
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,390
So the first law of
thermodynamics says that

297
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,230
energy cannot be created or
destroyed, only transformed.

298
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,630
So let's say that internal
energy is changing.

299
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,140
So I have this system, and
someone tells me, look, the

300
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,370
internal energy is changing.

301
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,070
So delta U, that's just a
capital delta that says, what

302
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,730
is the change an internal
energy?

303
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,600
It's saying, look, if your
internal energy is changing,

304
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,310
your system is either having
something done to it, or it's

305
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,780
doing something to
someone else.

306
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,430
Some energy is being
transferred to it

307
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,540
or away from it.

308
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,950
So, how do we write that?

309
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,360
Well the first law of
thermodynamics, or even the

310
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,920
definition of internal energy,
says that a change in internal

311
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,810
energy is equal to heat added to
the system-- and once again

312
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,810
a very intuitive letter for
heat, because heat does not

313
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,380
start with Q, but the
convention is

314
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,490
to use Q for heat.

315
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,520
The letter h is reserved for
enthalpy, which is a very,

316
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,530
very, very similar
concept to heat.

317
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,720
We'll talk about that maybe
in the next video.

318
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,250
It's equal to the heat added to
the system, minus the work

319
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,500
done by the system.

320
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,790
   

321
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,180
And you could see this
multiple ways.

322
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,760
Sometimes it's written
like this.

323
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,550
Sometimes it's written that the
change in internal energy

324
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:18,440
is equal to the heat added to
the system, plus the work done

325
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,730
on the system.

326
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,960
And this might be very
confusing, but you should just

327
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,020
always-- and we'll really kind
of look at this 100 different

328
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,990
ways in the next video.

329
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,440
And actually this
is a capital U.

330
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,680
Let me make sure that I write
that as a capital U.

331
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,270
But we're going to do it
100 different ways.

332
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,400
But if you think about it, if
I'm doing work I lose energy.

333
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,790
I've transferred the energy
to someone else.

334
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,360
So this is doing work.

335
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,090
Likewise, if someone is giving
me heat that is increasing my

336
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,380
energy, at least to me these
are reasonably intuitive

337
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:48,980
definitions.

338
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,950
Now if you see this, you say,
OK, if my energy is going up,

339
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,750
if this is a positive thing, I
either have to have this go

340
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,340
up, or work is being
done to me.

341
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:05,730
   

342
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,220
Or energy is being transferred
into my system.

343
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,930
I'll give a lot more examples of
what exactly that means in

344
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,880
the next video.

345
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,030
But I just want to make
you comfortable

346
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,120
with either of these.

347
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,520
Because you're going to see
them all the time, and you

348
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,200
might even get confused
even if your teacher

349
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,970
uses only one of them.

350
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,050
But you should always do
this reality check.

351
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,100
When something does work, it
is transferring energy to

352
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,310
something else, right?

353
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,120
So if you're doing work, it'll
take away, this is taking

354
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,340
away, your internal energy.

355
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,780
Likewise, heat transfer is
another way for energy to go

356
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,180
from one system to another, or
from one entity to another.

357
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,680
So if my total energy is going
up, maybe heat is being added

358
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,730
to my system.

359
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,210
If my energy is going down,
either heat is being taken

360
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,450
away from my system, or I'm
doing more work on something.

361
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,690
I'll do a bunch of examples
with that.

362
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,000
And I'm just going to leave you
with this video with some

363
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,050
other notation that
you might see.

364
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,030
You might see change in internal
energy is equal to

365
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,850
change-- let me write it again--
change in internal

366
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,290
energy, capital U.

367
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,360
You'll sometimes see it as,
they'll write a delta Q, which

368
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,060
kind of implies change
in heat.

369
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,820
But I'll explain it in a future
video why that doesn't

370
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,240
make a full sense, but you'll
see this a lot.

371
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,670
But you can also view this as
the heat added to the system,

372
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,020
minus the change in work,
which is a little

373
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,240
non-intuitive because when you
talk about heat or work you're

374
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,000
talking about transferring
of energy.

375
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,790
So when you talk about change
in transfer it becomes a

376
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,470
little-- So sometimes a delta
work, they just mean this

377
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,580
means that work done
by a system.

378
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,750
So obviously if you have some
energy, you do some work,

379
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,760
you've lost that energy, you've
given it to someone

380
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,610
else, you'd have a
minus sign there.

381
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,060
Or you might see it written like
this, change in internal

382
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:58,120
energy is equal to heat added--
I won't say even this

383
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,860
kind of reads to me
as change in heat.

384
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:06,690
I'll just call this the heat
added-- plus the work done

385
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,630
onto the system.

386
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:15,160
So this is work done to, this
is work done by the system.

387
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,020
Either way.

388
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,040
And you shouldn't even memorize
this, you should just

389
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,410
always think about
it a little bit.

390
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,349
If I'm doing work I'm going
to lose energy.

391
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,700
If work is done to me I'm
going to gain energy.

392
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,920
If I lose heat, if this is a
negative number, I'm going to

393
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,290
lose energy.

394
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,710
If I gain heat I'm going
to gain energy.

395
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,440
Anyway, I'll leave you there
for this video, and in the

396
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,010
next video we'll really try to
digest this internal energy

397
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,410
formula 100 different ways.

398
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:39,699
