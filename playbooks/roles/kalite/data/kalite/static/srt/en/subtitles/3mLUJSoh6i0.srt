1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
   

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,250
Let's continue with the
30, 60, 90 triangles.

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,480
   

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,640
So just review what we just
learned, or hopefully learned--

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,910
at minimum what we just saw,
--is if we have a 30, 60, 90 --

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,380
and once again, remember: this
is only applies to 30, 60, 90

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:26,560
triangles --and if I were to
say the hypotenuse is of length

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,320
h, we learned that the side
opposite the 30-degree angle,

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,340
and this is the shortest side
of the triangle, is going to be

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,270
h over 2, or 1/2 times
the hypotenuse.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,240
And we also learned that the
longer side, or the side

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,810
opposite the 60-degree side,
is equal to the square

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,840
root of 3 over 2 times h.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,640
So let's do a problem where
we use this information.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,370
Let's say I had this
triangle right here.

16
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,010
It's a 90-degree triangle;
let's say that this

17
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,690
is 30 degrees.

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,750
And we could also figure out
obviously if that's 30, this

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,040
is 90, that this is
also 60 degrees.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,510
And let's say that the
hypotenuse is 12.

21
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,300
The length is 12 and we know
that this is the hypotenuse

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,980
because it's opposite
the right angle.

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,630
What is the side right here?

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,840
Well, is the side opposite the
60-degree angle, or is it

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,910
opposite the 30-degree angle?

26
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,460
It's the 30-degree angle
that opens into it, right?

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,650
I drew this triangle a little
bit different on purpose.

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,050
The 30-degree angle opens up
into this side, and it's

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,060
also the shortest side.

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,360
We learned that the side
opposite the 30-degree angle is

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,680
half the hypotenuse, so the
hypotenuse is 12;

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,860
this would be 6.

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,310
And this side, which is
opposite the 60-degree side, is

34
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,730
equal to the square root of 3
over 2 times the hypotenuse.

35
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,690
So it's the square root of 3
over 2 times 12, or it's just

36
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,150
equal to 6 square roots of 3.

37
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,150
Another interesting thing is,
of course, the longer

38
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,600
non-hypotenuse side is square
root of 3 times longer

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,270
than the short side.

40
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,810
I don't confuse you too much.

41
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,660
Let's do another one.

42
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:15,010
   

43
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,800
Let's say this is 30 degrees--
it's our right triangle --and I

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,390
were to tell you that this side
right here is 5, what is

45
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,900
the length of this side?

46
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,970
   

47
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,750
Well first of all let's
figure out what we have.

48
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,390
5 is which side?

49
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,540
So if this is 30 degrees,
we know that this is

50
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,990
going to be 60 degrees.

51
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,010
So 5 is opposite the 60-degree
side, and x is the hypotenuse.

52
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,840
Since x is opposite the
90-degree side, it's also

53
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,010
the longest side of
the right triangle.

54
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,910
So we know from our formula
that 5 is equal to the square

55
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,940
root of 3 over 2 times the
hypotenuse, which in

56
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,850
this example is x.

57
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,240
And now we just solve for x.

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,770
We can multiply both
sides by the inverse

59
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,865
of this coefficient.

60
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:19,710
So if you just multiply 2 times
the square root of 3-- can

61
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:25,030
ignore this --we get 10 over
the square root of three here.

62
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,140
And, of course, this 2
cancels out with this 2.

63
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,667
This square root of 3 cancels
out this square root

64
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,970
of 3 is equal to x.

65
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,510
And now if you watched the last
couple of presentations, you

66
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,690
realize that this could be the
right answer, but we have a

67
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,660
square root of 3 in the
denominator, which people don't

68
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,980
like because it's an irrational
number in the denominator.

69
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,690
And I guess we could
have a debate as to

70
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,010
why that might be bad.

71
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,870
So let's rationalize
this denominator.

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,150
We say x is equal to 10 over
the square to 3; to rationalize

73
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,750
this denominator we can
multiply the numerator and the

74
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,910
denominator by the
square root of 3.

75
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,670
Because as long as we multiply
the numerator and the

76
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,280
denominator by the same thing,
it's like multiplying by 1.

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,790
So this is equal to 10 square
roots of 3 over square root of

78
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,996
3 times square of 3;
well that's just 3.

79
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:16,212
So x equals 10 square
roots of 3 over 3.

80
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:17,870
That's the hypotenuse.

81
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,990
I know I confused you.

82
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,920
And, of course, if this is 10
square root of 3 over 3--

83
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,600
that's the hypotenuse --we know
that the 30-degree side-- this

84
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,820
is 30 degrees --we know the
30-degree side is half of

85
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:35,430
that, so it's 5 square
root of 3 over 3.

86
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,100
Anyway, I think that might
give you a sense of the

87
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,230
30, 60, 90 triangles.

88
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,980
I think you might be ready now
to try some of the level two

89
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,080
Pythagorean Theorem problems.

90
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,600
Have fun.

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,392
