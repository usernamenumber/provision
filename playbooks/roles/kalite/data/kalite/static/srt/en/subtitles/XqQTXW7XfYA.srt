1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
   

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,550
Let's say I have 3 chairs.

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,710
   

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,210
They'll just be
blanks: 1, 2, and 3.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,210
3 chairs, and I have 7 people.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,310
I'll call them people A, B,
C, D, E-- how many is that?

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,630
That's 5-- F, G.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,420
So we have 7 people and what
I want to know is how many

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,400
different ways can these 7
people sit in these 3 chairs?

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,850
Well, before anyone sits down
if we just pick a chair, these

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,620
are just arbitrary labels for
the chairs, but let's start at

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,310
the left with chair number one.

13
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,760
If no one is sitting down, how
many different people could

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,130
sit down in chair one?

15
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,310
Well, 7 people are standing up,
no one is sitting in any of the

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,480
chairs, so 7 different people
could sit in chair one.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,070
So there are 7 possibilities
for chair one.

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,880
So 1 of those 7 possibilities
is going to sit

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,400
down in chair one.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,060
So how many people are
left to sit in chair two?

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,960
Well, 1 less than 7, right?

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,310
6 people are going to be
left to sit in chair two.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,130
And then of course, if 2 people
are already sitting down, how

24
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,480
many people are left to
sit in chair three?

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,690
Well, there's going to
be 5 possibilities.

26
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,640
So a way to think about it, for
each of these possibilities,

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,940
there are 6 possibilities in
this chair and 5 possibilities

28
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,980
in that chair for
each of those 6.

29
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,760
So you would multiply all
of the possibilities.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,830
Hopefully that
makes some sense.

31
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,320
We'll try it out
with some examples.

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,140
So the total number of
possibilities in this

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,170
case is 7 times 6 times
5, and what is that?

34
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,500
6 times 5 is 30.

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,950
30 times 7 equals 210.

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,700
There's 210 possibilities.

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,470
That's a lot of possibilities.

38
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's do a slightly
smaller example.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,530
I mean we don't have to
do people in chairs.

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,770
Let's say we have cups.

41
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,480
   

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,880
And I'll do the cups
in a different color.

43
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,560
So this is 1 cup, cup one.

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,300
And then I have cup two.

45
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,720
And then I have 3 balls.

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,610
I have a magenta ball, I
have a brown ball, and

47
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,180
I have a yellow ball.

48
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,570
And I want to know, how many
different ways can I put these

49
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,620
3 balls into these 2 cups?

50
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,820
Well, assuming that I haven't
put any of the balls into any

51
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,130
of the cups as yet, how many
balls-- well, let's just

52
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,750
start with cup two.

53
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,410
I just want to show you that
you don't have to start at the

54
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,620
cup that happens to be labeled
number one sitting on the left.

55
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,380
If we haven't put any balls
into any of the cups, how

56
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,790
many can we put in cup two?

57
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,280
Well, there's 3
possibilities, right?

58
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,720
And for each of those
3 then, how many can

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,750
we put into cup one?

60
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,240
Well, we would've put 1 into
here, so there will be 2

61
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,300
left to put into cup two.

62
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,480
So it'd be 3 times 2
possibilities, which

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,420
is equal to 6.

64
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,560
And let's see if we
can draw them out.

65
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,010
Let me number these cups
because it's going to be

66
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,820
too difficult to keep
switching colors.

67
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:10,690
So let's say this
is A, B, and C.

68
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm going to show you that
there are 6 ways of putting

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,040
these 3 balls into
these 2 cups.

70
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,460
So it could be A in cup
one, B in cup two.

71
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,770
It could be B in cup
one, A in cup two.

72
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,740
Right, you could
just switch them.

73
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,740
So we actually care which
ball goes into what cup.

74
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,670
Not just is a ball in a cup.

75
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,870
It could be A with C.

76
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,800
A in cup one, C in cup two.

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,270
It could be C in cup
one, A in cup two.

78
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,390
And then finally, you
could just have B and C.

79
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,530
B in cup one, C in cup two.

80
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,780
Or C in cup one, B in cup two.

81
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,440
And notice, if we just cared
which of the balls were picked,

82
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,890
but we didn't care whether they
were in cup one or cup two, we

83
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,270
could get rid of this bottom
line and there would be 1/2

84
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,180
as many ways to place them.

85
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,480
But when we care where the
balls are-- we care whether

86
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,340
they're in cup one or cup two,
or in this case we care if

87
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,530
they're in seat one,
two, or three.

88
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,170
The ways in which we're
ordering, we call

89
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,730
these permutations.

90
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:22,060
And up here, the way we would
write this permutation, we

91
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,050
would say, well, how many ways
can we fit 7 people into 3

92
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,970
chairs if we care about what
chair they're sitting in?

93
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:35,900
So we could write that as 7
people-- and the p isn't

94
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,650
for people, it's for
permutations-- into 3 chairs.

95
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,560
And another notation for it,
you write a big P and you

96
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,380
say, how many ways can I
put 7 things into 3 spaces?

97
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,220
Or it could be written as,
how many ways could you put

98
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,100
7 things into 3 spaces?

99
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,060
And in this case, we
got the answer is 210.

100
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,790
And actually, it
will always be 210.

101
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,920
And I'll show you
why in a second.

102
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,160
How would we write this?

103
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,990
Well, this would be--
I'll do it in green.

104
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,520
We had 3 things and we
put it into 2 spaces.

105
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,690
So 3 things into 2 spaces.

106
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,770
That's the same thing as 3
things into 2 spaces, which

107
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,160
is equal to 3 things
into 2 spaces.

108
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,850
I'm just showing you the
different notations, and we

109
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,480
figured out that that was 6.

110
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,230
Let's see if we can figure
out a general formula if

111
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,700
we wanted to evaluate nPk.

112
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,980
   

113
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,805
How many ways can we fit
n things into k spaces?

114
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:43,310
   

115
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,740
So if we think about it,
let's just use some analogy.

116
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,940
We'll have k spots, so it'll
be 1 spot, 2 spots, 3 spots,

117
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,980
all the way to k spots.

118
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,790
In the first spot there's n
possibilities, just like we

119
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,670
did in the last two examples.

120
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,580
There's n possibilities there.

121
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,980
Then, since 1 person or 1 thing
will be placed in spot one,

122
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,300
there's going to be n minus 1
possibilities for spot two.

123
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,660
And similarly, n minus 2
possibilities for spot three.

124
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,360
And then, we could follow that
pattern all the way, and how

125
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,855
many possibilities are there
going to be for spot k?

126
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:28,520
Well in everything it's n
minus 1 thing less than the

127
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,690
spot number in our case.

128
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,150
I mean I guess we could have
started with spot 0, but this

129
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,550
is better because we actually
numbered all the way to k.

130
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:42,270
So it will be n
minus k minus 1.

131
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,400
And that might seem
complicated, but

132
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
it makes sense.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,350
When we did 7 things into 3
spots we went 7 times 6 times--

134
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,130
we literally put in the top
three of you could almost

135
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,800
say from the factorial.

136
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,140
7 factorial will be
7 times 6 times 5.

137
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,330
I think this will help.

138
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,750
If this was just 3 was so
7 times 6 times 5 times 4

139
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,350
times 3 times 2 times 1.

140
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,650
That's 7 factorial.

141
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,660
But we only took the first
3 of the factorial.

142
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,110
And similarly, 6-- well,
6 is also 3 factorial.

143
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,410
But another way you could view
it is we only took the first 2

144
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,130
of 3 factorial So what we're
saying here is we just take

145
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,230
the first k of n factorial.

146
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,010
So is there any easy
way to write that?

147
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:40,480
To write the first
k of n factorial.

148
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,040
Why sure.

149
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,020
We could write it as n
factorial and the formula's

150
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,170
almost harder than
what it's saying.

151
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,370
We could write it as n
factorial-- it;s a lower

152
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:58,920
case n-- n factorial over
n minus k factorial.

153
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,930
Let's see if that works.

154
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, what's going to happen?

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,010
So in this case, n
factorial was 7.

156
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,760
So it was 7 times 6
times 5 times 4 times

157
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,020
3 times 2 times 1.

158
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,890
And then what was n
minus k factorial?

159
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,480
Well, in our example, k
was the number of spots,

160
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,650
and there were 3 spots.

161
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,440
So 7 minus 3 is 4,
so 4 factorial.

162
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,590
4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

163
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,460
And of course,
this will cancel.

164
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,080
Let me do that in a
different color.

165
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,940
This will cancel with this,
and so you're just left with

166
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,090
the first 3 of 7 factorial.

167
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:46,590
The 3 largest components
of 7 factorial.

168
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,740
I always rederive this because
all I think of is what

169
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,460
we did originally.

170
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,500
I was like, oh, OK.

171
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,530
If we're doing permutations,
I just start the factorial

172
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,760
until I run out of spots.

173
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,310
I do 7 times 6 times 5.

174
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,290
And let's see if it
works out here too.

175
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,450
So what is 3 factorial because
we have 3 different things?

176
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,820
3 factorial over-- and
then 3 minus 2 factorial.

177
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,660
   

178
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,190
Well, that's just 1 factorial.

179
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,300
So it becomes 3 times
2 times 1 over 1.

180
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,680
And of course, the 1's cancel
out and we got the 3 times 2.

181
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,890
Hopefully that make sense.

182
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,050
A lot of people, they learn the
permutation notation and they

183
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,370
say, oh, that's n factorial
over n minus k factorial, where

184
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,450
n is the number of things I
need to place and n minus

185
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,630
the whole thing factorial.

186
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,200
And k is the number
of spots I have.

187
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,210
And they just memorize it.

188
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:49,330
But all this is saying is you
start doing the n factorial,

189
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,320
but you only do the first 3
components of the factorial.

190
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,810
And it makes sense just from
how we started off the video.

191
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,950
If you 7 things, well, 7 things
could go here, 6 things could

192
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,740
go here, 5 things
could go here.

193
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,580
No more spots?

194
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,710
Just multiply them.

195
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,140
And that's all this
formula is saying.

196
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,400
Hopefully I didn't confuse you,
and I will see you in the

197
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,590
next video on combinations.

198
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,500
