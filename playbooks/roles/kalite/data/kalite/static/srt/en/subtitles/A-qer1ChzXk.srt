1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870
   

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,510
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,130
I was running out of time in
the last video and I was

4
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,630
afraid that I was jumbling up
the problem just to get in

5
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,700
under the wire.

6
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,780
So I just drew the triangle.

7
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,950
Actually, let me do it over
since I have all the time in

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,380
the world now.

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,660
Because I really want
you to get this.

10
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,720
So the original parallelogram
looks like this.

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:28,560
   

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,820
This is a diagonal.

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,450
And they tell us that all of
these sides are congruent, so

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,070
that means that they're
all the same length.

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,500
So this side is equal to the
side is equal to this side,

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,050
this side is equal
to this side.

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,930
So that also tells you these
are both equilateral

18
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,730
triangles, all the sides are
equals so all these angles,

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,830
this must be 60, this must be
60, this must be 60, this must

20
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,390
be 60, 60 and 60.

21
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,770
Now what else do we know?

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:12,180
They want us to figure out the
ratio of this diagonal, the

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,020
long diagonal to this shorter
diagonal right here.

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,300
We know the shorter diagonals
of length 1.

25
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,260
And with parallelograms, you
might already kind of know

26
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,830
this, and actually we could
prove this to you.

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,490
Since all of these lines
are congruent, we know

28
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,010
that-- we know what?

29
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,130
What is this angle right here?

30
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,130
What is half of-- this line
is going to bisect

31
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,990
both of these angles.

32
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,470
How do we know?

33
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,040
Well if it didn't bisect
it, all the

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,420
sides wouldn't be congruent.

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,670
So we know that this side is 30,
this side is 30, this is

36
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,080
30, this is 30.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,500
And we also know that for any
parallelogram-- actually for

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,940
any rhombus-- the two soon.
diagonals are going to be

39
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,980
perpendicular bisectors
of each other.

40
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,940
It's not true for any
parallelogram, it's only true

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,940
when the sides are
all congruent.

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,750
In this situation, and we
already know this because this

43
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,830
is a 30 degree angle, this is
a 60 degree angle, so what

44
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,200
does this have to be?

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,496
This has to be a 90 degree
angle because they have

46
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:22,470
to add up to 180.

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,100
So let's just pick numbers.

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,570
Let's say that this side is 1,
this side is 1, this side is

49
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,990
1, this side is 1.

50
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,770
Then this entire diagonal here
would be 1, half of it would

51
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,540
be 1/2, this would be 1/2,
this would be 1/2.

52
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,490
If we didn't know it was 1/2, we
could just say well this is

53
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,770
a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

54
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,230
So the 30 degree side is
1/2 of the hypotenuse.

55
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,730
And then what else do we know
about 30, 60, 90 triangles?

56
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:48,030
The 60 degree side is squares
of 3 times the shorter side.

57
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,180
So this side is going to be
square root of 3 over 2.

58
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,990
And all we did is we realized
that this is

59
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,310
a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

60
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,320
And then we were using the
principle of 30, 60, 90

61
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,240
triangle to figure out that
the side opposite the 60

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,880
degree side is square
root of 3 over 2.

63
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,770
If that side is square root of
3 over 2, then this is also

64
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,810
square root of 3 over 2.

65
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,650
So what's this entire length?

66
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,310
It'd be square root of 3 over
2 plus square root of 3 over

67
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,300
2, which is equal to
square root of 3.

68
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,260
You add two halves of anything
you get the whole.

69
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,760
So the square roots of 3.

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,020
So the purple diagonal is square
roots of 3, and what is

71
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,640
this-- this was d and c.

72
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,890
This is ac.

73
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,880
   

74
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,540
So we know that ac is equal
to the square root of 3.

75
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:45,120
And we also know that d-- I'm
sorry, this is a b-- db is

76
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,700
equal to 1.

77
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,920
We just defined it as 1.

78
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,220
So the ratio of ac to bd or
db is going to be square

79
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,420
root of 3 to 1.

80
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,580
And that is choice B.

81
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,910
I hope I didn't confuse you.

82
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,360
Next section-- actually, we just
finished that section.

83
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,820
I'll see you

84
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,300
