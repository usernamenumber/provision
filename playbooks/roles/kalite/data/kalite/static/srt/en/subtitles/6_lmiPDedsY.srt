1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
   

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,790
I'm now going to do a
bunch more examples

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,120
using the chain rule.

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,320
So let's see.

5
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,920
Once again.

6
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:13,930
If I had f of x is equal to,
let's see, I don't like this

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,100
tool that I'm using now,
let's have one of these.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:28,390
f of x is equal to, say, x to
the third plus 2x squared

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,600
minus, let's say, minus
x to the negative 2.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,960
We haven't put any negative
exponents in yet, but I

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,060
think you'll see that
the same patterns apply.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,520
And all of that to, let's
say, the minus seven.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,077
We want to figure out what
f prime of x, what the

14
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:48,260
derivative of f of x is.

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,540
So this might seem very
complicated and daunting to

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,220
you, and obviously to take
this entire polynomial to

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,470
the negative seventh power
would take you forever.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,590
But using the chain rule, we
can do it quite quickly.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,610
So the first thing we want to
do, is we want to take the

20
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,460
derivative of the inner
function, I guess

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,420
you could call it.

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,630
We want to take the
derivative of this.

23
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,990
And what's the derivative of x
to the third plus 2x squared

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,770
minus x to the negative 2?

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,600
Well, we know how to do that.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,790
That was the first type
of derivatives we

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,210
learned how to do.

28
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:22,210
It's 3x squared and 2 times 2,
plus 4x to the first, or just

29
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,270
4x, and then here, with a
negative exponent, we do

30
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,120
the exact same thing.

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,320
We say negative 2 times
negative 1, right, there's a 1

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,450
here, we don't write it down.

33
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,360
So negative 2 times negative 1
is plus 2 x to the, and then we

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,210
decrease the exponent by
1, so it's x to the

35
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,530
negative 3, right?

36
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,980
So we figured out what the
derivative of the inside is,

37
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,990
and then we just multiply
that, that whole thing, times

38
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,750
the derivative of kind of
the entire expression.

39
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,210
So then that'll be, we
take the minus 7, let me

40
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,270
do a different color.

41
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,800
So this is the entire thing.

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:13,620
So then we take minus 7, so
it's times minus 7, this

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,130
whole expression, I'm
going to run out of space.

44
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:22,370
x to the third plus 2x squared
minus x to the minus 2.

45
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,400
That's minus x to the minus 2.

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,900
And all of that, we just
decrease this exponent

47
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,980
by 1, to the minus 8.

48
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,040
So let me write it all down
a little bit neater now.

49
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,230
So we get f prime of x as the
derivative of f of x is equal

50
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:52,500
to 3x squared plus 4x plus 2x
to the minus third power, I

51
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,310
don't know why did that.

52
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,190
That's minus 3.

53
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:04,450
Times minus seven times x to
the third plus 2x squared minus

54
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,710
x to the minus two, all of that
to the negative eight power.

55
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,970
And we could simplify
it little bit.

56
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,640
Maybe we could just multiply
this minus 7, times, we could

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,005
distribute it across
this expression.

58
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:23,510
So we'd say, that equals minus
7, so this equals minus 21 x

59
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:34,260
squared, minus 28 x minus
14x to the negative 3.

60
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:43,980
All of that times x to the
third plus 2 x squared minus x

61
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,950
to the minus 2 to the minus 8.

62
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,950
So there we did it.

63
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,990
We took this, what I would say
is a very complicated function,

64
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,290
and using the chain rule and
just the basic rules we had

65
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,260
introduced a couple of
presentations ago, we were able

66
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,030
to find the derivative of it.

67
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,650
And now, if we wanted to, for
whatever application, we could

68
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,320
find the slope of this function
at any point x by just

69
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,910
substituting that point into
this equation, and we'll get

70
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,120
the slope at that point.

71
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,400
Let me do a slightly harder
one, to show you that the chain

72
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,400
rule, you can kind of go
arbitrarily deep in

73
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,969
the chain rule.

74
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:30,010
   

75
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,610
OK.

76
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,010
So let's say I had, let
me see if I can write it

77
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,000
a little bit thinner.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,340
If I had f of x, I don't know
if you can see that, I'm going

79
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,560
to do it a little fatter.

80
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,480
f of x is equal to, I want to
make it a little bit more

81
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,520
complicated this time.

82
00:04:48,520 --> 00:05:03,420
3x to the minus 2 plus 5 x to
the third minus 7x, all of that

83
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,620
to the fifth, and then this
whole expression to

84
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,900
the third power.

85
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,560
So I imagine you saying, Sal,
you're starting to go nuts,

86
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,010
this is going to
take us forever.

87
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,630
Well, I'll show you, using
the chain rule, it will

88
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,500
not take that long.

89
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,200
So the way I think about
it, so-- f prime of x,

90
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,480
f prime of x equals.

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,360
I start off kind with
the innermost function.

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,210
So let me see if I can
use colors to make it

93
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:28,820
a little bit simpler.

94
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,430
Let's take the derivative of
this innermost function first.

95
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,940
Actually, let me give
you the big picture.

96
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,820
We want to find the derivative
of the innermost function, and

97
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,860
then a little bit bigger,
and then a little bit

98
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,890
more big than that.

99
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,980
I know that's not precise
mathematical terms, but

100
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,310
you'll get the point when
I show you this example.

101
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,860
So first we'll do this
inner function, this

102
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
inner expression.

103
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,520
And the derivative of
that's pretty easy, right?

104
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,270
It's 15x squared
minus 7, right?

105
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,020
that was pretty
straightforward.

106
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,150
And now we're going to want
to multiply that times this

107
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,010
entire derivative here.

108
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,280
So let me circle that in
a different-- so then

109
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,750
we want to do this.

110
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,240
We're going to multiply that
times this entire derivative.

111
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,140
Well, that's just times 5.

112
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,420
And we just pretend like this
is just an x here, right?

113
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,795
Because the derivative
of x to the fifth is 5x

114
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:28,150
to the fourth, right?

115
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,590
But instead of an x, we have
this whole expression, 5x

116
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,680
to the third minus 7x.

117
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,130
So we'll write that.

118
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,360
5x to the third minus 7x.

119
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,520
Now the exponent here
goes down by one.

120
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,540
So it's 5 times 5x to the
third minus 7x, all that

121
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,070
to the fourth power.

122
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,330
So we figured out the
derivative of this so far, and

123
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,646
then we want to figure out the
derivative of this, so we'll

124
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:53,000
add it, right, because we're
trying to figure the derivative

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,880
of this entire expression.

126
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,120
So this is an easy one.

127
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,020
Let me draw that in
a different color.

128
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,870
So we want the
derivative of this.

129
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,450
So that's negative 2 times
3, so that's negative

130
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,430
6x to the minus three.

131
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,610
So what have we done so far?

132
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,270
We've so far figured out the
derivative of this entire

133
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,540
expression, right?

134
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,850
The derivative of that
entire expression using

135
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,170
the chain rule is this.

136
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,910
And now, we're almost done.

137
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,290
We just have to multiply that.

138
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,630
So I'm going to just, I've run
out of space on that line, but

139
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,170
let's just assume that
the line continues.

140
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,770
So that's times.

141
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,360
And now we just take the
derivative of kind of

142
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,410
this whole big thing.

143
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,346
And now it's going to be the
derivative of, I'm going

144
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,580
to use this brown color.

145
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,950
So it's a whole big expression
to the third power, right?

146
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,520
So that becomes times 3 times
the whole expression, right?

147
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,270
That's 3 times, now I'm going
to write the whole thing, 3x to

148
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:06,670
the minus 2 plus 5 x the third
minus 7x, that to fifth, and

149
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,220
then you decrement this by
1, to the second power.

150
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,600
That was an ultraconfusing
example, and this is probably

151
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,850
the hardest chain rule problem
you'll see in a lot of

152
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,340
the questions you'll
have on your test.

153
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,450
You see, it wasn't
that difficult.

154
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,200
We just kind of went to the
smallest possible function, and

155
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,760
actually the smallest possible
function would have been one of

156
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,710
these terms, but we just found
the derivative of this, which

157
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,690
was 15 x squared minus 7, and
then we just used the principle

158
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,420
that the derivative of kind of
a function is just the

159
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,960
derivative of each of its
parts-- well, actually, the

160
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,400
derivative of-- we figured out
the derivative of this inner

161
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,464
piece, which was 15x squared
minus 7, and then we multiplied

162
00:08:43,464 --> 00:08:47,350
it times the derivative of this
slightly larger piece, which is

163
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,210
5 times this entire expression
to the fourth, then we added it

164
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,980
to the derivative of
3x to the minus 2.

165
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,470
And then that whole thing, and
actually I should put a big

166
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,810
parentheses around here, that
whole thing, we multiply it

167
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,180
times the derivative of
this larger expression.

168
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,630
I think I might have confused
you, so I apologize if I have,

169
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,810
and in the next presentation
I'm going to just do a bunch

170
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,000
more chain rule problems, and
at some point, it should

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,670
start to make sense to you.

172
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,210
I think it's just a matter
of seeing example, after

173
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,940
example, after example.

174
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,380
I'll see you into the next
presentation, and I apologize

175
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,440
if I have confused you.
