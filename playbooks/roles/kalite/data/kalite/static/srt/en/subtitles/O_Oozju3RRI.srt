1
00:00:00,207 --> 00:00:03,653
Going with my habit of overly simplified economy let's imagine economy that

2
00:00:03,653 --> 00:00:07,999
has only two actors in it: so that's Mr Farmer right over here

3
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:12,368
I'll do my best to draw the farmer, maybe he has the mustache of some kind

4
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:15,362
so that's Mr Farmer right over here, he's got a hat on

5
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:20,923
so it has Mr Farmer So that is the Farmer

6
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:24,669
in this economy, and we'll also have a Builder

7
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:27,570
so this economy they are producing two things: they are producing food and this Builder

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,587
can help mantain stuff so maybe

9
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:38,152
so maybe this is Mr Builder right over here

10
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:40,343
is Mr Builder. And let's say, for the sake of

11
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:44,021
do here let's say that for this economy it kind of a constant that

12
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:47,028
either of these fellows gets an extra dollar to spend

13
00:00:47,028 --> 00:00:51,935
he is going to spend 60% of it so I'll introduce a formal word that

14
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:55,278
that really is another way of saying that: in this economy

15
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:59,186
the marginal propensity to consume: MPC

16
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:03,507
propensity to

17
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:07,320
consume is

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,659
open parentesis is often MPC

19
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,550
that is equal to say 60%

20
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,932
and or is equal to 0.6

21
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:23,436
And all this thing if someone in this economy somehow finds another dollar

22
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:26,596
in their pocket they're going to spend 0.6 of that or

23
00:01:26,596 --> 00:01:31,227
60% of that, so if you give the Builder, if the builder gets some extra dollar

24
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:35,509
he is going to spend another 60 cents on another things Farmer

25
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:39,174
if the Farmer gets another dollar he is going to spend 60%

26
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:43,258
or 60 cents with the builder. Now, given this assumption let's

27
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:47,565
think about what'll happen in this economy if all of the sudden one of them decided to

28
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,658
increase their spending over there: so all the sum

29
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:55,260
economy let's say the farmer discovers

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,760
a sac in a drawer that he didn't realise was there

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,148
currency maybe get a

32
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:09,434
maybe currency in that is

33
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:09,652
dollar and the farmer discovers that he

34
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:16,511
he discovers a big power dollar in the sac

35
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,428
and he say and do some repairs to my building

36
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:23,354
so let's we have this kind of increase in

37
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:27,154
spending that's going on, so the farmer says I'm going to spend

38
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:31,689
I'm going to spend 1000 dollars and I'm going to

39
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:33,835
give it to the builder, now the builder says

40
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:40,099
1000 dol, I have the marginal propensity to consume or 0.6

41
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,367
he is going to spend

42
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:50,229
with the farmer he is going to spend 60%

43
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:56,134
times 1000 dol, which is equal to 600 dol

44
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:00,684
well now the farmer says

45
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:03,961
1000 somehow the builder to spend

46
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:06,478
more on me much more

47
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:12,395
I had 600 more I have the marginal propensity

48
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:15,751
to consume of 0.6 or 60% so I'll spend

49
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:17,977
60% of that 600 dol that I've just got

50
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:23,720
it will be 60% of that thing so it will be

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,315
60 decimal so it will be 0.6

52
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:32,101
times this thing which is 0.6

53
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:35,468
times 1000 or you can say 60%

54
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:38,392
of this 600 dol which is going to equal to 360 dol.

55
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:43,950
now the builder says

56
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,073
I gave the initial 600 dol another 360 dollars

57
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:52,925
and I have the amrginal propensity to consume of 0.6 so I'll

58
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,430
spend 60% of that bothered on this spending

59
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,033
he also spends 60% of this right over here and 60% of this

60
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:03,251
is 0.6 times this whole thing

61
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:07,690
0.6 times this thing

62
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,269
times 0.6 times this thing - times 0.6

63
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,109
times 1000 dol. Now this

64
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:20,683
number right over here 60% of 360 dol

65
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:24,530
I'd like to calculator to figure what it is exactly

66
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,035
so let's say that I have

67
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:34,993
it's 0.6 to the 3rd power

68
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:37,542
0.6 to the third

69
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:40,203
multiply that times 1000

70
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:44,204
gives us 216 dollars. so this guy

71
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:46,943
write it over here

72
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:52,380
I'm going to spend 60% of that

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,020
is going, and 60% of you see where it's going

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,955
so it's going to be 0.6

75
00:04:56,955 --> 00:05:02,038
times this thing which is already 0.6 times 0.6

76
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:08,236
0.6 times 0.6 to the 3rd power

77
00:05:08,236 --> 00:05:11,729
0.6 to the 4th power times

78
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:16,186
1000 which is whatever sixty

79
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:17,560
percent of

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,143
0.6 gives us 115 dollars

81
00:05:24,143 --> 00:05:27,552
129, and this guy Oh I have

82
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:32,030
spend 60% of that, and this goes on and on

83
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,967
so given this think how much from that incremental

84
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:39,553
increase of spending of a 1000 dollars how much total

85
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:42,724
new production and spending happen in this economy

86
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:46,003
so the way to think about that - so the total

87
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:53,094
we can do the either way we can do kind of GDP

88
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:56,224
output income expenditure

89
00:05:56,224 --> 00:06:00,280
these all views because economy is a very thing

90
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,182
one persone's expenditure turns into another person's income

91
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:07,444
we can say total output here measured in our agreed currency

92
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:11,633
which is dollars this is now going to be

93
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:16,188
original 1000 farmer spend for the builder

94
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:21,408
original 1000 plus this 1st right over here

95
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:24,197
this that the builder spent

96
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:28,313
.6 times 1000 plus

97
00:06:28,313 --> 00:06:31,305
than we have this time the farmer said I'm

98
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:39,500
6 square

99
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,770
times 1000 and than this guy

100
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,591
I spend 60% of that

101
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:48,687
and spend gives 3rd power

102
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:52,157
1000 + 0.6 to the 3rd power times

103
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:55,304
1000 and that the last

104
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:59,302
keep going on and on forever theoretically

105
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:04,828
6 + 0.6 to the 4th power

106
00:07:04,828 --> 00:07:08,852
times 1000 and this will keep going on and on

107
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:11,663
forever plus 0.6 to the 5th power

108
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:15,875
0.6 to the 6th power and going on and on forever

109
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:21,907
and one of those things about mathematics

110
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,526
equall multuply is that you can actually sum

111
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:28,057
up because this value right over here is less than one

112
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:31,736
ends up being infinite sum

113
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:35,355
you can actually take this infinite sum and find number so just to simplify this

114
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:40,175
the total output from that's kind of original 1000

115
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:43,675
we can factured 1000 new colour

116
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:48,408
so we can fracturate 1000 left with

117
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:52,929
one plus 0.6 plus

118
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:57,404
0.6 square + 0.6

119
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:01,667
to the third power plus 0.6 to the 4th power

120
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:04,508
on and on and on and on the next video

121
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:10,322
just for fun, but his write over here it's an infitinite sum

122
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,998
geometric series and this actually simplify to

123
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:17,975
as one over one

124
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:20,945
minus 0.6, so whatever this number is

125
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:23,280
here that will be

126
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,456
this will be equal one over

127
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:34,631
0.4 and 0.4

128
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:37,616
is two fifths one over two fifths

129
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,895
which is equal to 5 halfs

130
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:46,345
so your total output is going to be equal to

131
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:50,153
1000 times 5 halfs

132
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:54,262
and this the same thing as equal to 1000 times 2,5

133
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:58,366
which is equal to 25 hundret (2500)

134
00:08:58,366 --> 00:09:02,384
there is two interesting ideas going here. one is when people get a bit of more income, they're going to

135
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:06,024
spend some of it adn that's the marginal propensity to consume

136
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:09,356
how much you 60% of that

137
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:13,149
60% it keep going multiplied throw the economy

138
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,500
multiplier fraction of that get spent

139
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,055
some fraction of that get spent

140
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:24,403
1000 that first 1000 dollars got multiplied

141
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:29,988
by 2,5 and that 2,5 was completely a function of what the

142
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:34,288
MPC was, so we have this relationship here

143
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:37,739
is that whatever the marginal propensity to consumer is that drives

144
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:41,507
the multiplier that drives the multiplier

145
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:45,615
all the multiplier say if you spend an extra dollar in this economy

146
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:49,261
given people's MPC how much

147
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:53,000
will than increase total output
