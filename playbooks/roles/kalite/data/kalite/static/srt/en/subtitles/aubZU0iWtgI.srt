1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,550
In this video, I want to
cover several topics

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,650
that are all related.

4
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,850
And on some level, they're
really simple, but on a whole

5
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,883
other level, they tend to
confuse people a lot.

6
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,110
So hopefully we can
make some headway.

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,400
So a good place to start-- let's
just imagine that I have

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,460
some type of container here.

9
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,130
Let's say that's my container
and inside of that container,

10
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,430
I have a bunch of
water molecules.

11
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,070
It's just got a bunch
of water molecules.

12
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,550
They're all rubbing against
each other.

13
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,920
It's in its liquid form,
this is liquid water.

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,340
and inside of the water
molecules, I

15
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,050
have some sugar molecules.

16
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,790
Maybe I'll do sugar in
this pink color.

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,690
So I have a bunch of sugar
molecules right here.

18
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,040
I have many, many more water
molecules though.

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,290
I want to make that clear.

20
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,420
I have many, many more water molecules in this container that we are dealing with.

21
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,660
Now in this type of situation,
we call, we call the thing that there's

22
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,440
more of, the solvent.

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,350
So in this case, there's more
water molecules and you can

24
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,990
literally just view more as
the number of molecules.

25
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,010
I'm not going to go into a whole
discussion of moles and

26
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,140
all of that because you may or
may not have been exposed to

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,670
that yet, but just imagine
whatever there's more of,

28
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,740
that's what we're going
to call the solvent.

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:24,630
So in this case, water
is the solvent.

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,030
And whatever there is less of, so the more water is the solvent and in that case, that is the
in this case, that is the

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,730
sugar-- that is considered
the solute.

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,292
this is the solute, so the sugar.

33
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,640
It doesn't have to be sugar.

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,320
It could be any molecule that
there's less of, in the water,

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,570
in this case,sugar.

36
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,750
is the solute

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,620
And we say that the sugar has
been dissolved into the water.

38
00:01:49,620 --> 00:02:03,500
sugar,has been dissolved, dissolved into, into the water

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,420
And this whole thing right here,
the combination of the

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,229
water and the sugar molecules,
we call a solution.

41
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,140
We call this whole
thing a solution.

42
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,870
And a solution has a solvent
and the solute.

43
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,160
The solvent is water.

44
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,110
That's the thing doing the
dissolving and the thing that

45
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,220
is dissolved is the sugar.

46
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,290
That's the solute.

47
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,950
Now all of this may or may not
be review for you, but I'm

48
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,870
doing it for a reason-- because
I want to talk about, I want to talk about

49
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,370
the idea of diffusion, diffusion

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,490
And the,the idea is actually
pretty straightforward.

51
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,790
If I have, let's say,let's same
the same container.

52
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,600
Let me do it in a slightly
different container here, just

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,640
to talk about diffusion.

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,180
We'll go back to water
and sugar--

55
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,070
especially back to water.

56
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,570
Let's say we have a container
here and let's say it just has

57
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,830
a bunch of-- let's say it just
has some air particles in it.

58
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,560
It could be anything-- oxygen
or carbon dioxide.

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,880
So let me just draw a couple
of air molecules here.

60
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,060
So let's say that that is a
gaseous-- just for the sake of

61
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,590
argument-- gaseous oxygen.

62
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,900
So each of this is an O2--
each of those, right?

63
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,900
And let's say that this is the
current configuration, that

64
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,710
all of this is a vacuum here
and that there's some

65
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,220
temperatures.

66
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,490
So these water molecules,
they have some

67
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,280
type, some type of kinetic energy.

68
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,620
They're moving in some type of
random directions right there.

69
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,760
So my question is, what is going
to happen, what is goign to happen in this type

70
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,810
of container?

71
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,710
Well, any of these guys are
going to be randomly bumping

72
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,770
into each other.

73
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,030
They're more likely to bump into
things in this down-left

74
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,120
direction than they are in
the up-right direction.

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,970
So if this guy was happening
to go in this down-left

76
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,110
direction, he's going to bump
into something and then

77
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,070
ricochet into the up-right
direction.

78
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,480
But in the up-right
direction, there's

79
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,040
nothing to bounce into.

80
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,990
So in general, everything is
moving in random directions,

81
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,250
but you're more likely
to be able to move in

82
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,000
the rightward direction.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,500
When you go to the left, you're
more likely to bump

84
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,130
into each other, into something.

85
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,090
So it's almost common sense.

86
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,550
Over time, if you just let this
system come to some type

87
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,580
of equilibrium-- I'm not
going to go into detail

88
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,340
on what that means.

89
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,340
You can watch the thermodynamics
videos if you'd

90
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,470
like to see that.

91
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,000
You'll eventually see the
container will look

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,140
something like this.

93
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,200
I can't guarantee it.

94
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,500
There's some probability it
would actually stay like this,

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,920
but very likely that those five
particles are going to

96
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,970
get relatively spread out.

97
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,790
This is diffusion and so it's
really just the spreading of

98
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,940
particles or molecules from
high concentration to low

99
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,140
concentration areas, right?

100
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,420
In this case, the molecules are
going to spread in that

101
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,780
direction from a high
concentration to a low

102
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,130
concentration area.

103
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,920
Now you're saying, Sal,
what is concentration?

104
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,060
And there's many ways to measure
concentration and you

105
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,120
can go into molarity and
molality and all of that.

106
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,830
But the very simple idea is, how
much of that particle do

107
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,900
you have per unit space?

108
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,780
So here, you have a lot of those
particles per unit space

109
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,550
and here you have very
few of those

110
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,850
particles per unit space.

111
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,230
So this is a high concentration
and that's a low

112
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,970
concentration.

113
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,740
So you could imagine other
experiments like this.

114
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,000
You could imagine a solution
like-- let's do

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,250
something like this.

116
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,570
let me make

117
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,820
Let's say I have
two containers.

118
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,440
let's see two container.

119
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,230
Let's go back to the
solution situation.

120
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,720
This was a gas, but I started
off with that example so let's

121
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,432
stay with that example.

122
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:35,530
So let's say that I have a door
right there that's larger

123
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,370
than either the water or
the sugar molecules.

124
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,305
On either side, I have a bunch
of water molecules.

125
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:52,020
I have a bunch of water molecules on either side, just like that on either side

126
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,300
So I have a lot of
water molecules.

127
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,650
So if I just had water molecules
here-- they're all

128
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,690
bouncing around in random
directions-- and so the odds

129
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,890
of a water molecule going this
way, equivalent to what odds of a

130
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,590
water molecule going that way,
assuming that both sides have

131
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,570
the same level of water
molecule, otherwise the

132
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,510
pressures would be different.

133
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,070
But let's say, you know that the top
of this is the same

134
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,170
as the top of this.

135
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,730
So there's no more pressure
going in one

136
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,790
direction or another.

137
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,240
So you know if,it for whatever reason, a
bunch of more water molecules

138
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,772
were going in the rightward
direction, then all of a

139
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:20,760
sudden this would fill up with
more water and we know that

140
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,620
that isn't likely to occur.

141
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,200
So this is,you know, this is just a solution, with or , this is just two containers of waters
of water.

142
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,340
Now let's put some
solute in it.

143
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,230
Let's dissolve some solute in it
and let's say we do all the

144
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,630
dissolving on the
left-hand side.

145
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,620
So we put some sugar molecules
on the left-hand side.

146
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,910
And these are small enough to
fit through this little pipe.

147
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,280
right, that's just one assumption
that I'm making.

148
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,120
So what's going to happen?

149
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,710
All of these things have some
type of kinetic energy.

150
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,630
They're all bouncing , they're all bouncing around.

151
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,250
Well, over time,you know, the water's
going back and forth.

152
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,600
This water molecule
might go that way.

153
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,040
That water molecule might go
that way, but they net out each

154
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,810
other out, but over time one of
these big sugar molecules

155
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,520
will be going in just the
right direction to go

156
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,470
through--maybe you know maybe this guy's,
instead of going that

157
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,380
direction, he starts off going
in that direction.

158
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,630
He goes just through this,throught this,uhm throught this tunnel
connecting this two

159
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,050
containers and he'll end
up there, right?

160
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,320
And this guy will still
be bouncing around.

161
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,570
There's some probability he goes
back, but there's still

162
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,420
more particles,more sugar particles
here than there.

163
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:31,350
So there's still more
probability that one of, so these

164
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,350
guys will go to that side
than one of these guys

165
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,340
will go to that side, that one of these guys will go to that side,

166
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,980
So you can imagine if you're
doing this with gazillions of

167
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,650
particles-- I'm only doing it
with four-- over time, the

168
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,440
particles will have spread out
so that their concentrations

169
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,550
are roughly equal.

170
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,950
So that maybe you'll have
two here over time.

171
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,430
But if, but when you're only dealing
with three or four or five

172
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,380
particles, there's some
probability it doesn't happen,

173
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,240
but when you're doing it with a
gazillion and they're super

174
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,810
small, it's a very, very,
very high likelihood.

175
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,590
But anyway, this whole process--
we went from a

176
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,460
container of high concentration
to a container

177
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,080
of low concentration and the
particles would have spread

178
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,530
from the low concentration
container to the high

179
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,590
concentration container.

180
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,130
So they diffused.

181
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,820
This is diffusion.

182
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,170
This is diffusion

183
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,880
And just so that we learn some
other words that tend to be

184
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,800
used with the idea of
diffusion-- when we started

185
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,260
off, this had a higher
concentration.

186
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,715
The left-hand side container
had higher concentration.

187
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:33,110
Higher concentration, higher concentration

188
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,130
It's all relative, right?

189
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,480
It's higher than this guy,higher concentration

190
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,505
And this right here had
a lower concentration.

191
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:42,799
Lower concentrarion

192
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,450
And there are words
for these things.

193
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,650
This solution with a high
concentration is called a

194
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,330
hypertonic solution.

195
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,730
Let me write that in yellow.

196
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:58,330
Hyoer, Hypertonic solution

197
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,120
Hyper, in general, meaning
having a lot of something,

198
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,620
having too much of something.

199
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,925
And this lower concentration
is hypo, hypotonic

200
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:13,720
Hypotonic solution,lower concentration

201
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,660
You might have heard maybe one
of your relatives, if they

202
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,730
haven't had a meal in awhile
say, I'm hypoglycemic.

203
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,230
That means that they have
not-- they're feeling

204
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,910
lightheaded.

205
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,800
There's not enough sugar in
their bloodstream and they

206
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,730
want to pass out so
they want a meal.

207
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,930
If you just had a candy bar,
maybe you're hyperglycemic--

208
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,930
or maybe you're just
hyper in general.

209
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,580
But, so, you know, so these are just good
prefixes to know, but

210
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,650
hypertonic-- you have
a lot of the solute.

211
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,510
You have a high concentration.

212
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,500
And then in hypotonic, not too
much of the solute so you have

213
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,010
a low concentration.

214
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,130
These are good words to know.

215
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,220
So in general, diffusion-- if
there's no barriers to the

216
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,790
diffusion like we had here, you
will have the solute go

217
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,820
from a high concentration or
hypertonic solution if they

218
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,490
can travel to a hypotonic
solution, to a hypo, where the

219
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,520
concentration is lower.

220
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,480
Now let's do an interesting
experiment here.

221
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,930
We've talked about diffusion and
so far we've been talking

222
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,530
about the diffusion of
the solute, right?

223
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,770
And in general-- and this is not
always the case-- if you

224
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,780
want to be as general as
possible, the solute is

225
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,400
whatever you have less of,
the solvent is whatever

226
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,510
you have more of.

227
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,600
And the most common solvent
tends to be water, but it

228
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,520
doesn't have to be water.

229
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,870
It could be some type
of alcohol.

230
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,390
It could be a...you, know it could be mercury.

231
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,880
It could be a whole set of
molecules, but water in most

232
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,130
biological or chemical systems
tends to be the

233
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,460
most typical solvent.

234
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,920
It's what other things
are dissolved into.

235
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,380
But what happens if we have a
tunnel where the solute is too

236
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,060
big to travel, but water is
small enough to travel?

237
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,370
Let's think about
that situation, let's think about the situation

238
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,090
In order to think about it,
I'm going to do something

239
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,830
interesting.

240
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,670
Let's say we have a
container here,let's say

241
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,950
Actually, I won't even
draw a container.

242
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,190
Let's just say we have an
outside environment that has a

243
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,260
bunch of water.

244
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,630
This is the outside environment
and then you have

245
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,880
some type of membrane.

246
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,400
you have some type of membrane here, that's a membrane

247
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,040
Water can go in and out
of this membrane.

248
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,190
So it's semi-permeable.

249
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,520
Well, it's permeable to water,
but the solute cannot go

250
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,110
through the membrane.

251
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,680
So let's say that the
solute is sugar.

252
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,060
So we have water on
the outside and

253
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,126
also inside the membrane.

254
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:39,380
So these are little small
water molecules.

255
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,950
This is a membrane right here.

256
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,520
And let's say that we have some
sugar molecules again--

257
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,560
I'm just picking on sugar.

258
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,760
It could have been anything.

259
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,050
So we have some sugar molecules
here that are just a

260
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,950
little bit bigger-- or they
could be a lot bigger.

261
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,750
Actually, they're a lot bigger
than water molecules.

262
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,700
You have a bunch of-- and I only
draw four, but you have a

263
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,210
gazillion of them, right?

264
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,470
You have that much more
water molecules.

265
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,325
I'm just trying to show you have
more water molecules than

266
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,290
sugar molecules.

267
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,645
And this membrane is
semi-permeable.

268
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,210
Permeable means it allows
things to pass.

269
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,070
Semi-permeables means it's
not completely permeable.

270
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,650
So semi-permeable-- in this
context, I'm saying I allow

271
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,440
water to pass through
the membrane.

272
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,850
So water can pass,
but sugar cannot.

273
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,100
Sugar is too large.

274
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,220
So if we were to zoom in on the
actual membrane itself--

275
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,580
maybe the membrane
looks like this.

276
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,980
I'm going to zoom in
on this membrane.

277
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,620
So it has little holes in the
membrane, just like that.

278
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,270
And maybe the water molecules
are about that size.

279
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,820
So they can go through
those holes.

280
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,250
So the water molecules can go
back and forth through the

281
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,520
holes, but the sugar molecules
are about that big.

282
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,990
So they cannot go through
that hole.

283
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,280
They're too big for this opening
right here to go back

284
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,830
and forth between them.

285
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,680
Now what do you think is going
to happen in this situation?

286
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,330
So first of all, let's
use our terminology.

287
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,720
Remember, sugar is our solute.

288
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,120
Water is our solvent.

289
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,930
Semi-permeable membrane.

290
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,400
Which side of the membrane
has a higher or lower

291
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,330
concentration of solute?

292
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,690
Well, the inside does.

293
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,060
The inside is hypertonic.

294
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,540
The outside has a lower

295
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,850
concentration so it's hypotonic.

296
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,680
Now, if these openings were big
enough, based on what we

297
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,330
just talked about-- these guys
are bouncing around, water is

298
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,700
travelling in either direction,
and equal

299
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,520
probability or-- actually
I'm going to talk

300
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,360
about that in a second.

301
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,660
If everything was wide open, it
would be equal probability,

302
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,780
but if it was wide open, these
guys eventually would bounce

303
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,450
their ways over to this side and
you'd probably end up with

304
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,500
equal concentrations
eventually.

305
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,710
And so you would have your
traditional diffusion, where

306
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,130
high concentration
of solute to low

307
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,530
concentrations of solute.

308
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,350
But in this case, these
guys-- they can't

309
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,330
fit through the hole.

310
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,160
Only water can go
back and forth.

311
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,180
If these guys were not here,
water would have an equal

312
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,780
likelihood of going in this
direction as they would be

313
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,940
going in that direction, a
completely equal likelihood.

314
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:40,090
But because these guys are on
the right-hand side of-- or in

315
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,290
this case, on the inside
of our membrane.

316
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,000
This is our inside of our
membrane zoomed up-- it's less

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,440
likely because these guys
might be in the approach

318
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,230
position of the holes-- that's
slightly less likely for water

319
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,110
to be in the approach position
for the holes so it's actually

320
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,720
more probable that water could
enter than water exit.

321
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,180
And I want to make
that very clear.

322
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,150
If these sugar molecules were
not here, obviously it's

323
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,830
equally likely for water to
go in either direction.

324
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,730
Now that these sugar molecules
are there, these sugar

325
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,290
molecules might be on
the right-hand side.

326
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,200
They might be blocking-- I guess
the best way to think

327
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,430
about it is blocking the
approach to the hole.

328
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,060
They'll never be able to go
through the hole themselves

329
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,490
and might not even be blocking
the hole, but they're going in

330
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,720
some random direction.

331
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,580
So if a water molecule was
approaching-- it's all

332
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,360
probabilistic and we're dealing
with gazillions of

333
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,610
molecules-- it's that much more
likely to be blocked to

334
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,360
get outside.

335
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,620
But the water molecules from the
outside-- there's nothing

336
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,170
blocking them to get in so
you're going to have a flow of

337
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,480
water inside.

338
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,310
So in this situation, with a
semi-permeable membrane,

339
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,700
you're going to have water.

340
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,280
You're going to have a net
inward flow of water.

341
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,430
And so this is kind
of interesting.

342
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,900
We have the solvent flowing from
a hypotonic situation to

343
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,600
a hypertonic solution,
but it's only

344
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,210
hypotonic in the solute.

345
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,620
But water-- if you flip it the
other way-- if you've used

346
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,290
sugar as the solvent, then you
could say, we're going from a

347
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,470
high concentration of water to
a low concentration of water.

348
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,370
I don't want to confuse
you too much.

349
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,090
This is what tends to confuse
people, but just think about

350
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,040
what's going to happen.

351
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,260
No matter in what situation,
the solution is going to do

352
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,000
what it can to try to
equilibriate the

353
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,680
concentration.

354
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,080
To make the concentrations
on both

355
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,710
sides as close as possible.

356
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,150
And it's not just some magic.

357
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,160
It's not like the
solution knows.

358
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,300
It's all based on probabilities
and these things

359
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,050
bumping around, but in this
situation, water is more

360
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,790
likely to flow into
the container.

361
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,700
So it's actually going to go
from the hypotonic side when

362
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,460
we talk about low concentration
of solute to the

363
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,690
side that has high
concentrations of solute, of

364
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,320
sugar-- and actually, if this
thing is stretchable, more

365
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,670
water will keep flowing
in and this membrane

366
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,420
will stretch out.

367
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,420
I won't go to too much detail
here, but this idea of water--

368
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,470
of the solvent-- if in this
case, water is the solvent--

369
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,150
of water as a solvent
diffusing through a

370
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,500
semi-permeable membrane,
this is called osmosis.

371
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,170
You've probably heard learning
by osmosis-- if you put a book

372
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,200
against your head, maybe it'll
just seep into your brain.

373
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,000
Same idea.

374
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,500
That's where the word
comes from.

375
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,570
This idea of water seeping
through membranes to try to

376
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,600
make concentrations
more equal.

377
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,370
So if you say, well, I have high
concentration here, low

378
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,490
concentration here.

379
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,020
If there was no membrane here,
these big molecules would

380
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,080
exit, but because there's this
semi-permeable membrane here,

381
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,680
they can't.

382
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,400
So the system just
probabilistically-- no magic

383
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,090
here-- more water will enter
to try to equilibriate

384
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,160
concentration.

385
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,970
Eventually-- if maybe there's a
few molecules out here-- not

386
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,440
as high concentration here--
eventually if everything was

387
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,970
allowed to happen fully, you'll
get to the point where

388
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,120
you have just as many--
you have just as high

389
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,650
concentration on this side as
you have on the right-hand

390
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,500
side because this right-hand
side is going to fill with

391
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,380
water and also probably become
a larger volume.

392
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,520
And then, once again, the
probabilities of a water

393
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,600
molecule going to the right and
to the left will be the

394
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,920
same and you'll get to some
type of equilibrium.

395
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,910
But I want to make it very
clear-- diffusion is the idea

396
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,130
of any particle going from
higher concentration and

397
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,740
spreading into a region that has
a lower concentration and

398
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,950
just spreading out.

399
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,240
Osmosis is the diffusion
of water.

400
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,210
And usually you're talking about
the diffusion of water

401
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,010
as a solvent and usually it's
in the context of a

402
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,260
semi-permeable membrane, where
the actual solute cannot

403
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,530
travel through the membrane.

404
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,800
Anyway, hopefully you've
found that useful and

405
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,880
not completely confusing.
