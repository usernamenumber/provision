1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,530
I'm going to draw a molecule
of benzene.

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,340
And then we're going to think
about if anything interesting

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,550
might happen with
that molecule.

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,140
So let me draw it.

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,680
So we have 6 carbons
in a ring.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:22,290
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
carbons in a ring.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,030
What's interesting about
benzene, why it's different

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,320
than cyclohexane, is that
it has these 3 double

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,520
bonds in the ring.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,400
So let's say we have these two
carbons are double bonded to

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,150
each other, these two carbons
are double bonded, and then

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,630
these two carbons over here
are double bonded.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,550
Actually, I'll draw the
hydrogens here just so that we

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,050
remember that they're there.

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,930
But I'll it in a subtle color.

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,960
So this carbon right
here is going to be

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,320
bonded to how many hydrogens?

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,880
It has 1, 2, 3 valence electrons
already used up.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,390
So it's going to have one
bonded to one hydrogen.

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,080
This one right here,
same thing.

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,050
Bonded to one hydrogen.

23
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,400
So it has 4 valence electrons.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,380
This one, same thing.

25
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,350
I think you see the pattern.

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,180
That each of these are-- they
have three bonds to carbons,

27
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,770
one single bond to two carbons,
and then one extra

28
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,390
double bond.

29
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,890
And then the fourth bond
is to hydrogen.

30
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,040
So let me just draw all
of the hydrogens here.

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,420
I'm doing it in this dark color
so we don't have to pay

32
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,950
too much attention to it.

33
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,770
Now this right here,
this is benzine.

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,310
And you're going to see a lot
about benzine in the future.

35
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,910
But in this video, we're going
to study or try to understand

36
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,110
a particularly interesting
property of benzene, and

37
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,360
that's resonance.

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,720
   

39
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,520
And it's not a property of just
benzene, it's a property

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,150
of many organic molecules.

41
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,350
But benzene is kind of
the most fun version.

42
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,940
So let's think about what
might happen with this

43
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,370
molecule right here.

44
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,980
So I have this electron.

45
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,870
Let me do that in a
different color.

46
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,240
I have this-- let me
do it in this blue.

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,570
I have this electron
over here.

48
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,140
What if this electron moved over
to this carbon over here?

49
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,110
So this carbon is still going
to have the other

50
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,110
electron in the bond.

51
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,270
It's just going to kind of pivot
around a little bit.

52
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,259
So that electron moves
over there.

53
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,280
Now this carbon doesn't need 5
electrons, so this electron

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,170
goes to that carbon
right over there.

55
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,160
Now this carbon doesn't need 5
electrons, so that electron

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,850
goes back to the original
carbon that

57
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,210
lost that first electron.

58
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,160
So at the end of the
day, everyone has

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,800
kind of broken even.

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,390
If this happened, we might
end up with a structure

61
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,140
that looks like this.

62
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,360
And I'll draw a two-way arrow
because we can actually go in

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,880
both directions.

64
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,940
So let me draw just
the carbon chain.

65
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:53,790
So 1 carbon, 2 carbons, 3
carbons, 4 carbons, 5 carbons

66
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,620
and 6 carbons.

67
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,710
And then, over here, we had the
double bond over here, but

68
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,910
now it's moved over here.

69
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,380
So now the double bond-- and
actually, let me do it in a

70
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,070
blue color so we see
the difference.

71
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,100
So now the double bond
is over here.

72
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,750
This blue electron has
moved over there.

73
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,260
This blue electron has
moved up here.

74
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,040
Actually, let me color code it,
so it makes it very clear.

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,190
So let's say this is
a green electron.

76
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,100
Now the green electron has moved
from this carbon over to

77
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,630
that carbon.

78
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,960
We can imagine that
it's done that.

79
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,670
Then you would have this magenta
carbon or this magenta

80
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,290
electron that was with this
carbon, but now it's moved

81
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,390
over to this carbon over here.

82
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,540
And now the double bond
has shifted as well.

83
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,030
That's what this arrow showed.

84
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,740
   

85
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,850
We'll stick with the blue
carbon over there.

86
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,750
That blue carbon has moved down
to the original carbon.

87
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,015
And now the double bond
has shifted over here.

88
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:48,930
   

89
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,600
So we essentially have a very
similar, really, a very

90
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,100
similar molecule.

91
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,160
This is actually just a rotated
version of that.

92
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,320
But we have these double bonds
that could keep flipping back

93
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,140
and forth between this position
and that position

94
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,410
over there.

95
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,930
They can just keep
on doing it.

96
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,440
They can just keep flipping
either backwards or forwards.

97
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,560
And the reality of benzene is
that it's actually never in

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,090
either this structure
or this structure.

99
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,019
It's always, actually, in
something right in between.

100
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,110
The reality of benzene
actually looks

101
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,050
something more like this.

102
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,160
And I'll just draw it without
drawing all the carbons and

103
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,800
the hydrogens.

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,100
And obviously, in this case, let
me draw the hydrogens here

105
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,410
since I drew the hydrogens
up here.

106
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,700
This had the hydrogens
over here.

107
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Don't want to forget those.

108
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,585
If you ever forget them
they're implicit.

109
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:37,670
I want to draw the hydrogens.

110
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,970
But if we just look at the
overall ring, we know that the

111
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,790
carbons and the hydrogens
are implicit.

112
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,650
The actual structure of benzene
is actually in between

113
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,920
that and that.

114
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,490
In reality, you kind of have a
half double bond between all

115
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,720
of the carbons.

116
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
So the reality is, is that it
looks something like this.

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,830
So you have half a double bond
there, half a double bond

118
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,670
there, half a double bond over
here, half a double bond over

119
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,400
here, and then half a double
bond over here.

120
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,900
And then we're almost done.

121
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,250
And then, half a double
bond over here.

122
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,900
The reality of benzene is that
these electrons are actually

123
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,360
spinning around the
whole ring.

124
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,920
It's not flip-flopping
between this

125
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,260
structure and this structure.

126
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,220
The actual structure, the lower
energy state structure,

127
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,510
is this right here.

128
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,040
Now these Lewis diagrams or
actually, I haven't drawn all

129
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,850
of the Lewis electrons.

130
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,510
But these are considered
contributing structures.

131
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,650
And you often draw these when
you're doing reaction

132
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,600
mechanisms. But the reality
is, is that resonance, the

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,450
resonance of these positions
creates-- the reality of

134
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,120
benzene is that it's actually
sitting in this

135
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,230
intermediate position.

136
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,600
Now, this doesn't happen
only with benzene.

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,590
Another example, there's going
to be many examples.

138
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,840
But just so that we're familiar
with maybe two of the

139
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,130
best examples, another example
that you'll see a lot in the

140
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,270
context of resonance is
the carbonate ion.

141
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,460
So carbonate ion.

142
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,670
You have a double bond to one
oxygen and then you have

143
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,980
single bonds to two
other oxygens.

144
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,240
And those two other oxygens
have extra electrons.

145
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:12,070
So if I were to draw this oxygen
over here it has 1, 2,

146
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,980
3, 4, 5, 6 valence-- or
actually, I should

147
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,930
say, it has 7 valence.

148
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,150
Let me make it very clear.

149
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,800
So it has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7 valence electrons.

150
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,140
It has one extra electron, so
it has a negative charge.

151
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,480
And the same is true
for this one.

152
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,220
It has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7 valence electrons.

153
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,800
One extra.

154
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,030
So it has a negative charge.

155
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,330
If you were to just look at
this, I guess you could call

156
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,420
it this resonance structure or
this contributing structure,

157
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,330
you'd say hey, maybe this
oxygen-- and this oxygen here

158
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,120
is neutral, so it has
6 valence electrons.

159
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,980
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

160
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,230
Maybe, just maybe, one of these
electrons can be given

161
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,180
to the carbon and then the
carbon would lose an electron

162
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,740
to this guy on top.

163
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,290
So maybe you could imagine a
situation where this electron

164
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,720
right here gets given
to the carbon.

165
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,430
And when that gets given to
the carbon, the carbon

166
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,950
releases-- it all happen
simultaneously.

167
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,460
The carbon releases this
electron and it goes back up

168
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,910
to that oxygen over there.

169
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,340
And so what's that going
to look like if

170
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,630
that were to happen?

171
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,550
So if that were to happen,
now our structure

172
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,920
will look like this.

173
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,200
We have a carbon.

174
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,820
Now this carbon only has
a single bond up here.

175
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,520
And then we have our oxygen.

176
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,090
The oxygen, it had its
6 valence electrons.

177
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:52,420
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 valence
electrons.

178
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,320
But now it got this
extra blue one.

179
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,590
And now it got this extra blue
one, so now it has 7 valence

180
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,280
electrons, and it has
a negative charge.

181
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,230
Now this oxygen over here
gave one of its

182
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,150
electrons to the carbon.

183
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,050
Now it is bonded with it.

184
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,030
So now the carbon has
a double bond.

185
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,750
I'll actually do it
in that color.

186
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,320
Has a double bond with this
oxygen down here.

187
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,230
It gave an electron, so now it
only has 6 valence electrons.

188
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

189
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,040
And it is now neutral.

190
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,220
And this oxygen over here,
nothing really

191
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,280
new happened to it.

192
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,540
I could just copy
and paste it.

193
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,020
So let me copy and then
let me paste it.

194
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,799
So this one is just sitting
right like that.

195
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:41,650
But you could imagine a
situation where this oxygen

196
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,799
right here, then all of a
sudden-- and it could have

197
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,350
come from this oxygen up here
or it could come from this

198
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,520
oxygen right here.

199
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,450
This oxygen says hey, I have
an extra electron.

200
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,670
Let me give it to the carbon.

201
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,280
And then the carbon releases a
double bond with one of the

202
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,210
other oxygens.

203
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,080
In this case, it would
be this one.

204
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,940
Let me draw it.

205
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,810
So maybe this electron right
here gets given to the carbon.

206
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,150
Forms a double bond.

207
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,630
Then the carbon can let
go of an electron.

208
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,260
And so this electron right here
goes back to this oxygen.

209
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,780
And so what happens?

210
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,190
So if that were to happen, our
structure looks like this.

211
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:20,120
We have a carbon single bonded
to an oxygen up here that has

212
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,770
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
valence electrons.

213
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,730
That hasn't changed in-- we
could call it this resonance

214
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,110
reaction, or however you
want to call it.

215
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,420
So it still has a
negative charge.

216
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,100
We have this guy down here.

217
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,640
He took his electron back.

218
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,270
So now he has 7 valence
electrons again.

219
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:43,970
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 valence
electrons again.

220
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,760
And I can even show the
one that he got back.

221
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,220
That one's in purple.

222
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,870
So he now has a negative
charge.

223
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,540
And this guy now gave an
electron to the carbon.

224
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,790
So he forms a double bond,
a new double bond.

225
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,640
So this guy forms a double
bond with the carbon.

226
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,200
He gave an electron, so he
only has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

227
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,420
valence electrons, and
is now neutral.

228
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,030
Now these can all keep swapping
between each other.

229
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,160
You can even go from this
structure to that structure.

230
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,100
You can actually go from any one
of these structures to any

231
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,990
of the others.

232
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,990
And the reality of the
carbonate ion, let

233
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,420
me write this down.

234
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,670
This is the carbonate ion.

235
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,290
   

236
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,710
The reality of it is that its
true structure is some place

237
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,625
in between all of these.

238
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,180
   

239
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,630
So the true structure
of a carbonate ion

240
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,510
would look like this.

241
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,330
You would have a carbon and
you'd have three oxygens.

242
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,750
They have at least one
single bond with each

243
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,230
of those three oxygens.

244
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,790
And then you have 1/3 and then
you have-- actually, I should

245
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:54,630
say, you have 1/3 of a double
bond with each of them.

246
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,135
This is a 1/3 of a bond.

247
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:59,480
   

248
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,250
This is not standard notation,
but this is essentially going.

249
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,100
1/3 of the time, the electron
is on that bond.

250
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
And then the other 2/3 of the
time, each of these oxygens

251
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,920
have an extra electron.

252
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,835
You could imagine almost having
a negative 2/3 charge.

253
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:18,160
   

254
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,430
Now, people normally draw one
of these structures because

255
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,550
this is a nice-- kind of you're

256
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,530
dealing with whole numbers.

257
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,900
But the reality of carbonate
ions is that it's experiencing

258
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,690
this resonance.

259
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,280
That the electrons are actually
always floating in

260
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,170
between these forms. Actually
floating across

261
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,300
all of these bonds.

262
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,760
And that actually, makes this
molecule more stable.

263
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,170
This is at a lower energy state
than any of these forms.

264
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,150
And the same thing is
true with benzene.

265
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,800
This right here, where we're
in between these two

266
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,250
structures, is actually at a
lower energy state, a more

267
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,830
stable state than either
of these forms.

268
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,134
