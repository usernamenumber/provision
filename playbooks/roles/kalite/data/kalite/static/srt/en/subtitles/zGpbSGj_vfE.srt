1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,540
We're now equipped, I think,
with all of the tools to

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,780
convert back and forth between
polar and rectangular

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,280
coordinates.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,470
And hopefully you have a
reasonable intuition.

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,380
I mean, they're both just
two ways of specifying a

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,950
point in two dimensions.

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,500
Cartesian, you kind of say how
far left and right you go--

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,300
that's the x-coordinate.

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,000
And then the y-coordinate tells
you how far up and down you

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,120
go when you get to a point.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,070
When you do polar coordinates,
the angle tells you what

12
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,030
direction to point in, and then
the r, or you could view it as

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,330
the radius, tells you how far
to walk in that direction.

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,580
Right?

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,765
So they're just two ways to
specify a point in space.

16
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:35,720
And as we'll see some functions
are easier to specify, or

17
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,410
they're better described, in
polar coordinates, while other

18
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,710
functions are better described
in Cartesian coordinates.

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,570
But before we actually do
functions, let's do a couple

20
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,410
of quick problems using the
tools that we've built.

21
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,570
Let's say that we're given
the polar coordinate

22
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,090
4, 150 degrees, and we
wanted to convert this to

23
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:58,990
Cartesian coordinates.

24
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,420
So we want to
convert it to x, y.

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,510
Our first thing that we could
do is just to get an intuition

26
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,750
of where this even is.

27
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,300
Right now I think you're
already at the point where if I

28
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,020
give you an x and y coordinate
you already have a

29
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,130
visualization of
where that shows up.

30
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,660
But polar might be relatively
new, so let's try to draw it.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,170
So for me, when I do polar
I like to think about

32
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:24,970
the angle first.

33
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,300
So 150 degrees.

34
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,770
So if we start at the x-axis.

35
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's see.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,430
That's 90 degrees.

37
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,910
All the way around
is 180 degrees.

38
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,750
So this will be 30 degrees
away from 180, so it's going

39
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,260
to be in this direction.

40
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,550
Right?

41
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,830
This angle right here
is 150 degrees.

42
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,370
And I do find degrees easier
to visualize than radians.

43
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,040
That's, I think, just because
we use that in everyday life.

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,090
And then we're saying, OK I've
pointed you in this direction.

45
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,330
How far should you go?

46
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,680
It says, well you go 4 units
in the 150 degree direction.

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,740
So you go 4 units.

48
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,880
I don't know what that'll be.

49
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,160
I don't want to do that.

50
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,990
So I want to go 4 units
in that direction.

51
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,220
Let me do it in a
different color.

52
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:19,030
I'm just assuming this is
one, two, three, four units.

53
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,250
So that's 4, 150 degrees.

54
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,050
So we want to convert this
to Cartesian coordinates.

55
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,070
And so we already have an
intuition that our x-coordinate

56
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,630
should be some negative number,
and our y-coordinate should

57
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,720
be some positive number.

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,030
Right?

59
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,340
And let's see if
it all bears out.

60
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,690
So what are the tools that we
came up with in the last video?

61
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,540
Well, we came up with x is
equal to r cosine theta.

62
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,650
And that just fell
out of SOH-CAH-TOA.

63
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,990
Nothing fancy there.

64
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:49,610
And y is equal to r sine theta.

65
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,010
So this coordinate, x is
equal to r cosine theta.

66
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,390
So this is going to be-- let me
write it in a different color.

67
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,180
x is r-- so now we're dealing
with Cartesian coordinates--

68
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,300
r cosine theta.

69
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,280
So r is 4.

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,370
So it's 4 cosine
of 150 degrees.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,970
And then the y is r, which is
4, times sine of 150 degrees.

72
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,240
And now we can get
the calculator out.

73
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,070
OK.

74
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,530
So let's see.

75
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,890
What's the cosine of-- well,
I'll just write it out.

76
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,160
So 4 times the cosine of-- and
make sure your calculator

77
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,600
is in degree mode.

78
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,450
You don't want to make it think
you're saying 150 radians.

79
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,320
So it's minus 3.46.

80
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,930
So the x-coordinate
is minus 3.46.

81
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,286
And what is the y-coordinate?

82
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:55,305
It's 4 times sine of 150
degrees, which is equal to 2.

83
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,090
And that makes sense, right?

84
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,940
I mean if we eyeball it,
that looks about right.

85
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,870
If we go one, two, three, a
little bit more than three,

86
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,420
that looks like minus 3.46.

87
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,120
And then we go up one, two.

88
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,310
That looks like
about positive 2.

89
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,670
So our intuition was right.

90
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,050
You could either kind of orient
yourself into the 150 degree

91
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,950
direction and then march
forward in that direction, or

92
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,520
you could say I'm going to go
minus 3.46 to the

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,140
left and 2 up.

94
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,440
So we've just done a
transition from polar to

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,400
Cartesian coordinates.

96
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,390
Not too bad.

97
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,880
So now let's step it up a
little bit and actually convert

98
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,140
functions from Cartesian to
polar and polar to Cartesian,

99
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,970
and back and forth.

100
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,640
So I just did a random
web search for problems

101
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,440
and I found these.

102
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,770
The first one, they want us to
convert this, x squared plus y

103
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,260
squared is equal to 4,
to polar coordinates.

104
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,770
Right?

105
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,670
And hopefully you have some
intuition already that

106
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,640
this is a circle.

107
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:56,940
Right?

108
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,850
And it's actually even more
obvious when you do it

109
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,600
in polar coordinates.

110
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,230
So what were the
toolkits we had built?

111
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,630
We had figured out that x
squared plus y squared

112
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,560
is equal to r squared.

113
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,490
That was just the
Pythagorean theorem.

114
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:16,430
We knew that the tangent of
theta was equal to the opposite

115
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,230
over the adjacent-- y over x.

116
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:26,380
And we also learned that y is
equal to r sine of theta, and

117
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,440
x is equal to r cosine theta.

118
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,780
And you can prove all these
just from SOH-CAH-TOA and

119
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,440
the Pythagorean theorem.

120
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,500
But if you had to memorize one
thing going into an exam on

121
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,490
polar coordinates it would
be these four equations.

122
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,790
Not that I'm a big fan.

123
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,590
I actually don't have
these memorized.

124
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,290
I always spent, literally,
the first 10 seconds of the

125
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,050
exam writing these down or
reproving them, and that

126
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,090
way you'll never forget it.

127
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,920
But anyway, let's convert
this to polar coordinates.

128
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,840
Well, you should already
see we have an x

129
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
squared plus y squared.

130
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,170
And we already say, well
x squared plus y squared

131
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,410
is equal to r squared.

132
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,410
So we could just rewrite this.

133
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,770
This r squared is equal to 4.

134
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,400
And then you say, oh maybe r
is equal to plus or minus 2.

135
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,930
Right?

136
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,110
And it actually doesn't matter.

137
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,160
You could just say
r is equal to 2.

138
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,890
And what does that mean?

139
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,100
Actually, I think it'll be
instructive to graph this one.

140
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,620
I wasn't planning on it,
but I think it'll be

141
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,310
neat to show you.

142
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,130
I mean r equals 2, that's
such a simple equation.

143
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,890
How can that be a circle?

144
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,080
Well what is a circle?

145
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,380
A circle is something
of constant radius

146
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,180
around some point.

147
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,540
Right?

148
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,110
So this is staying
a constant radius.

149
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,670
Radius is equal to 2.

150
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,470
So if we take a distance
of-- so this is one, two.

151
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,700
So it says no matter what
the angle is, right?

152
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,740
This function doesn't
even involve the angle.

153
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,840
It says the radius is constant.

154
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,280
It doesn't matter
what angle I have.

155
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,170
So if the angle is
0 the radius is 2.

156
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,130
If the angle is, I don't
know, 30 degrees the

157
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,280
radius is still 2.

158
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,490
If the angle is 60
degrees it's still 2.

159
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,870
So the radius is 2
no matter what.

160
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,310
And I should probably
use the circle tool.

161
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,550
So as we go around
it doesn't matter.

162
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,380
The radius is always
going to be 2.

163
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,410
This distance is always going
to be 2, no matter what

164
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,150
direction we're pointed in.

165
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,220
And to some degree, that's
the definition of a circle.

166
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,650
A circle, in polar coordinates,
is actually a lot

167
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,800
easier to write down.

168
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,380
Radius is equal to 2.

169
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,780
That's a circle.

170
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,880
Let's do the next one.

171
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,170
Actually, I'm going to erase
this because I want to

172
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,130
reuse this over here.

173
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,880
So let me just black
that stuff out.

174
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,245
OK.

175
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,390
And then here I go.

176
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,180
All right.

177
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,890
The next one they give us is
x squared plus y squared is

178
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:43,790
equal to 9 times y/x squared.

179
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,200
All righty.

180
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,660
If we do some pattern matching,
well x squared plus y squared

181
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,200
we know that's equal
to r squared.

182
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,700
So this is equal to r squared
is equal to 9 times--

183
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,710
let's see, y over x.

184
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,860
That looks suspicious.

185
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,810
Tangent of theta
is equal to y/x.

186
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,500
So this is tangent of theta.

187
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,540
So 9 times tangent
of theta squared.

188
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,540
And maybe we want to take the
square root of both sides.

189
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,810
Right?

190
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,030
So r is equal to-- remember, we
have to take the square root of

191
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,395
both of these, because we're
taking the square root of

192
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:13,270
the whole both sides.

193
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,500
So it's r is equal to, we could
say plus or minus 3 tangent

194
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,000
of theta, but it actually
doesn't matter once again.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,410
And that happens a lot
in polar coordinates.

196
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,290
Actually, let me show you what
a negative radius means, just

197
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,950
so that you get the intuition
why in that previous example it

198
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,930
didn't matter whether I took
the radius as minus

199
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,830
2 or positive 2.

200
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,160
So for any given angle-- I just
want to give you an intuition

201
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,680
of what a negative radius is--
if I give you a positive radius

202
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,180
we're going to go in that
direction for this angle.

203
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,260
But if I give you a negative
radius we go in the

204
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,310
other direction.

205
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,620
So this would be a positive
radius, and this would

206
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,380
be a minus radius.

207
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,390
You just go backwards.

208
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,580
You walk backwards
in that direction.

209
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,720
So in that previous example we
could say, OK the radius is

210
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,170
equal to 2 no matter what.

211
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,490
Right?

212
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,910
So when you're angle is
in this direction your

213
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,090
radius is equal to 2.

214
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,710
Or you could say the radius is
always equal to negative 2.

215
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,990
Right?

216
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,610
When you're pointed in
this direction the radius

217
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,800
is equal to minus 2.

218
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,090
So it's always going
to be minus 2.

219
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,270
But it ends up being the
same thing either way.

220
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,600
And actually it turns out the
same thing for this equation,

221
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,240
so you could just say r is
equal to 3 tangent of theta.

222
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,910
If you're not sure, I guess
it doesn't hurt to put

223
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,020
the plus or minus there.

224
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,990
Next one.

225
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,220
Let me erase this one again.

226
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,570
Actually, I'm almost
out of time.

227
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,210
Let me continue this
in the next video.
